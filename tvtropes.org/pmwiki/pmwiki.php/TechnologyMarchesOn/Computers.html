The rockets are powerful, Apollo 11 <em>worked</em>, and the computer "fits in a single room!"</li><li> Lovell is panicking minutes after the explosion, and asks Ground Control if he got his trajectories right &mdash; the scene then cuts to a room full of engineers frantically moving <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule">slide rules<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> to check his math.

Among these: When asked whether he's "ever had any experience running a high-speed digital electronic computer", Virgil answers in the affirmative, adding, "My aunt has one." Cue laughter.</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MysteryTeam">Mystery Team</a></em>, where the "wacky facts" book Duncan reads from includes the fact "Did you know that one day, computers will be as small as your own bedroom?"<div class="indent"><strong>Duncan</strong>: "How <em>old</em> is this book?"</div></li><li> Cruelly used in the last few minutes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a></em>.

Hepburn plays Bunny, a research librarian for the imaginary Federal Broadcasting Network who is worried that EMERAC, the "electronic brain" being installed by computer engineer Richard Sumner (Spencer Tracy), will replace the whole department. EMERAC is cutting-edge for 1957, a huge machine with whirling spools of tape and panels of lights that flash for no good reason, but is rather hilarious to modern eyes. Equally funny is the treatment of the computer: The characters type out questions in standard English and are given answers in the same. For instance, in a demonstration, EMERAC is asked, "What is the total weight of the Earth?" and in reply prints out, "With or without people?" (which presumes that people are the weightiest form of life on earth; we are not even close, but that's beside the point ... the mass of <em>every living thing on the planet combined</em> is insignificant compared to Earth's overall mass).</li></ul></div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Literature&nbsp;</div><div id="folder2" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C.

These aliens discover, amongst other things:</li></ul><div class="indent">"The great room, which had been one of the marvels of the world [...]. No living eye would ever again see that wonderful battery of almost human Hollerith analyzers and five thousand million punched cards holding all that could be recorded on each man, woman and child on the planet."</div><ul><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.mayofamily.com/RLM/txt_Clarke_Superiority.html">Superiority<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, a computer containing just short of a million vacuum tubes requires a dedicated battleship to house it and a crew of five hundred highly trained people to operate and maintain it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> ran up against this one a lot. He wrote in the 1950s and 1960s, and liked to write about computers, so this was pretty much unavoidable. One story, <em>The Feeling of Power</em>, featured the use of humans with calculators in guided missiles to be an improvement on computers because computers are oh so very bulky &mdash; and <em>expensive</em> &mdash; in the far future.<ul><li> Another example is Multivac, a supercomputer of the size of many kilometers, that in some stories had enough computational power to solve the problems of mankind and in one story called "All the Troubles of the World" was able to predict when, where and by who every crime will be committed based only in psychological information, and then in "The Last Question" it became a deity in and of itself. Oh, yeah and it worked with either vacuum tubes or relays (although "The Last Question" did have it switch to smaller circuitry around 3000).</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFoundationTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFoundationTrilogy">The Foundation Trilogy</a></em>: There's a U-turn on this because in the first volume, two psychohistorians have palmtop computers capable of the massively complex math used by psychohistory, but in the last volume (centuries later), the protagonists are using slide-rules &mdash; futuristic slide-rules with lots of whizzy sliders, but still... This is because the first story of the original trilogy was the last to be written; the others originally appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/AstoundingScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/AstoundingScienceFiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a></em> as short stories, but "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePsychohistorians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePsychohistorians">The Psychohistorians</a>" was written specifically for the book collection when it was first published.</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity">The End of Eternity</a></em>. One of the biggest mainframes fits in the leader's office (and there is still room for a desk), and there are numerous laptops. It all uses punch tape, however.</li><li> In his short story <em>The Last Question</em>, multivac continues to get smaller and smaller until it all but disappears... but it's actually getting bigger and taking up room in hyperspace. Years later he lamented that he 'almost' got it right in this story.</li><li> In the various <em>Robot</em> novels, robots have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CranialProcessingUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CranialProcessingUnit">"positronic brains"</a> that, in more advanced models, provide not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>, but can also be upgraded to enable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a> as well! Bizarrely, at the same time, machines actually considered to be "computers" are big mainframes and often use things like punch cards and microfilm, and cannot even come close to the cognitive capabilities of a robot. Probably the result of a cultural blind spot in the 1950s as "computers" and "robots" were perceived to be very different technological concepts at the time. This led to situations bizarre, to us, like robot AI police officers reviewing case records by walking to the records room and reading index cards or a robot that spellchecked a manuscript by picking up the bound typewritten copy and leafing through it page by page.</li><li> In <em>The Stars, like Dust</em>, the hero calculates the trajectory for interstellar jumps by hand. The calculation is relatively complex to find the angle of the jump and the distance, but it's explicitly a straight-line jump across half the galaxy, and he has to work it out on paper.</li></ul></li><li> It could be said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a> didn't get computers at all, which is all the more jarring, given that he used them in his books <em>a lot</em>. However, the technologies he presented as a cutting edge for his far future stories were quite often already obsolete by the time the respective books were published. And then there's his obsession with the slide rules...<ul><li> The young adult novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TunnelInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TunnelInTheSky">Tunnel in the Sky</a></em> showed a character who, contemplating the flow of people through wormholes transporting them between planets, decided to calculate how long it would take the current population of the earth to go through, accounting for deaths and births along the way. He uses a slide rule.</li><li> In his other juvie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaveSpacesuitWillTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaveSpacesuitWillTravel">Have Spacesuit Will Travel</a></em>, the hero makes a big thing out of receiving a top-of-the-line slide rule as a birthday present.<ul><li> Actual line from that book: "I tell you, the slide rule is the greatest invention since girls."</li></ul></li><li> The story <em>Misfit</em> has a scene where nuclear explosives are being configured based on calculations made on the spot with a (circular) slide rule. Later on, the navigation computer for the asteroid being moved fails and a (very exceptional) human is able to step in and do the computations required in his head in real time at least as well as the computer could have.</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarmanJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarmanJones">Starman Jones</a></em>, also by RAH, has starship navigators using huge tables of 8-digit binary codes for navigation data, because the starship navigation computers have an 8-bit binary interface practically identical to the Altair 8800 computers that would come out in the early 1970s, 20 years or so after the book was written, but a couple centuries before it was set. Also, personnel records were indexed with <em>punch cards</em>.<ul><li> It was even worse than that: Not only the computers in this novel were apparently unable to convert the data between binary and decimal system, but so were <em>the people</em>. All conversions were done through precalculated reference tables, and the hero's ability to remember them verbatim was a large plot point later on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when the <em>navigation</em> tables were destroyed, and the protagonist remembered them as well</span>: Apparently they were too massive to fit in the computer memory, and they haven't thought of things like magnetic tape, for example.</li><li> To make matters worse, devices that were internally binary but converted to and from decimal in hardware at the external interfaces already existed at the time. They also weren't even using the computer for navigation per se, but just to do raw computations to speed up the work of the human navigators, while it would probably have been more efficient to build a machine to do it directly. And this technology had literally not changed in a generation, since the hero's memorized tables were from the books of a deceased relative.</li></ul></li><li> In another Heinlein work, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePuppetMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePuppetMasters">The Puppet Masters</a></em>, the main character has the equivalent of a modern Bluetooth earpiece implanted in his skull, people travel around in aircars, and major cosmetic surgery (at least for government agents) takes at most a couple of hours. All well and good, but when the main character goes to do research at his local library, the data is all stored in microfilm spools.</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CitizenOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CitizenOfTheGalaxy">Citizen of the Galaxy</a></em> is guilty as well: Targeting computers for the cee-fractional missiles that the spaceships shoot at each other were able to calculate the targeting solutions almost immediately, but were utterly incapable of such things as following the target and even roughly predicting its movement, thus necessitating a quick-witted human operator.<ul><li> Fully automated point defense guns (quad coaxial .50 caliber machine guns with their own target detection and tracking RADAR and an analog computer that could identify an incoming aircraft and accurately lay fire on it) were deployed on Allied ground vehicles in Western Europe before the end of WWII. Antiaircraft guns in England had gun-laying RADAR that could tell when the gun was aimed optimally to get the shell to burst on the target and fire the gun when it was also were in operation during the war, as were similar systems for self-defense guns on some bombers. In short, much less sophisticated technology than was available to the operators of the ships above was able to do essentially the job that they couldn't do.</li></ul></li><li> Gay Deceiver, the onboard computer of the protagonist's groundcar/aircar/spacecraft/trans-universal conveyance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNumberOfTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNumberOfTheBeast">The Number of the Beast</a></em> (1980) is described thus &mdash; "She stores sixty million bytes, then wipes last-in-last-out everything not placed on permanent. But her news storage is weighted sixty-forty in favor of North America." On top of that, the computer is a limited AI and has speech capability and voice recognition. It's programmed using semi-natural language with specific command words, which can be redefined or created on the fly; for example, "Gay, bounce!" instructs her to translate extradimensionally to a point ten thousand meters "upward" relative to her own frame of reference. (The command is just "Bounce!"; "Gay" or "Gay Deceiver" is used as an attention word, to let Gay know she's being given a command.) Many times during the course of the story, the computer is quickly and easily programmed by all four main characters. At one point they clean things up due to all the multiple programs they've input, which might cause unpredictable conflicts. All that with "sixty million bytes"! In other words, about 57 megabytes, about a tenth of Chandler's computer in that 1995 episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a> discussed above.<ul><li> The very name "Gay Deceiver" evokes a related trope: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">Have a Gay Old Time</a></li><li> The 'attention word' concept, funnily enough, will probably be more recognisable to viewers from the mid-late 2010s than in the 90s, due to the proliferation of voice-activated 'assistant' technologies like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Echo/Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana, OK Google and so on.</li></ul></li><li> Also of note, RAH describes a near future where Ford Motors has build a roadster that runs on a reaction-less drive, and can make orbital insertion. And a computers with less storage and CPU as in your cellphone (that is, Gay Deceiver) can be programmed with 'turing test' software to become self-aware.

But the concept of "computer games" is still so new that the nephew can only think of their entertainment potential in comparison to golf or football, and the middle-class gamer geek whose death kicks off the story plots his play-by-mail game moves on a large plywood-backed paper map because getting an actual <em>computer</em> would be far too bulky and expensive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerZelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> wrote a series of stories about an agent who was able to 'blank' his existence because he was part of the team that created the first world-wide person database.

Early in the book, he significantly increases the allocation for the Enterprise's message board, saying that the extra cost is worthwhile. This is shown to be a simple forum and message board. In the same novel, the problem of running out of onion dip is solved by cloning the culture to make more sour cream, but 430 people on a message board can overload their system.</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpaceMerchants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpaceMerchants">The Space Merchants</a></em>, written in the early 1950s but set sometime after 2010, the Venus rocket has to be piloted by a midget because an attempt at designing an automatic pilot could not be made to weigh less than "four and one half tons in spite of printed circuits and relays constructed under a microscope."</li><li> One famous example of getting it right is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MurrayLeinster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MurrayLeinster">Murray Leinster</a>'s short story <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.baen.com/chapters/W200506/0743499107___2.htm">A Logic Named Joe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, written in 1946.

Impressive when the book was written in 1982, but less so in 2019 with SD cards having about 100 terabits per cubic centimeter range. However, word length does vary between computer designs and the book never does mention what word length is common in that setting...</li><li> The third novel in the series, <em>Crystal Line</em>, has a scene with an inept office assistant unable to locate a computer file.

Then after that there are transistors. For example, in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Astroboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Astroboy">Astroboy</a></em>, at one point Astro is put out of commission because one of his tubes is damaged in battle and in a later story Professor Ochanomizu says "All you really need for a robot's head is a bunch of transistors". These days, most writers have abandoned this sort of thing, as it's unlikely that even modern microprocessors can support a true artificial intelligence and rely on ill-defined fictional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> to explain how their robots can think and feel the way humans can, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a>' mystical "Sparks" and later incarnations of Astroboy's "Omega Factor" and/or "Tenma Chips".</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IvanYefremov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IvanYefremov">Ivan Yefremov</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndromedaNebula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndromedaNebula">Andromeda Nebula</a></em> (written in 1955) the crew of the latest Earth starship compute their trajectory on what amounts to a programmable calculator, but takes at least a large desk and a couple of cabinets. They are aware of its shortcomings and complain that fully functional computers that are able to completely automate their vessel are too large and fragile to be mounted on starships.<ul><li> The irony of the story lies in fact that it's an entirely true description of the situation <em>of that time</em>: In 1955 a programmable calculator would indeed take a large desk and a couple of cabinets <em>at best</em>, and the universal computers only just have started to appear and indeed couldn't be put on any moving vessel.</li></ul></li><li> In Jack Vance's short story <em>Sail 25</em> a ship's computer's hard disk is sabotaged on a training flight in the asteroid belt.

Those teachers &mdash; who were trained in the 1950s-60s &mdash; didn't realize those schoolchildren would be carrying around cellphones which had a calculator built in &mdash; and upgradable to handle trigonometry and calculus!<ul><li> Even worse, by the mid-1970s, there were affordable scientific calculators (the TI SR-50) that included trigonometric and statistics functions and were small enough to carry in your shirt pocket, so you <em>could</em> carry it with you wherever you went. A decade later they were operating entirely on solar power. (This leaves aside the fad of wristwatches with calculators at the same time. They worked, but the buttons had to be impractically small for use... unless you were a school-aged child.)</li><li> Modern day teachers, instead of fighting the unstoppable wave of computer-powered mathematics, instead go along with it and allow their use in the classroom as a learning tool. Instead of just grading the outcome, these teachers will have their students solve the problem with a calculator, ask the students to solve it themselves with the calculator's result as a known-good reference, and grade the students in terms of the procedure used to reach the correct answer. On exam day, all calculators and electronics must be put in a corner of the classroom, and the exam questions will be specially designed so that only small numbers will show up during their execution in order to negate the need to even use a basic numeric calculator.<ul><li> Higher-level math classes (usually Algebra 2 and above) do tend to allow calculators on at least some exams, and some may even require one. Teachers and standardized test boards can even require a specific brand of calculator, usually a TI-84 in North America or a Casio calculator in Eurasia. The SAT currently has both a "math with calculator" and a "math without calculator" section.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> An aversion: the computers used in the US Space Shuttle were ridiculously outdated technology by the time the Shuttle was ever actually launched. NASA was well aware that a mission specialist with a $30 programmable calculator in his pocket had orders of magnitude more computing power available to him than the Shuttle itself did, but the computers in the Shuttle were <em>known to work</em>, and replacing them (and redesigning the Shuttle's systems to work with the newer technology) was considered to be an unacceptable risk for no real benefit... the existing systems worked well enough.</li></ul></div><p></p><h2>Computer Speed and Internet</h2><p>Nowadays, computer processing speeds and Internet capabilities often fall victim to this:</p><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anime and Manga&nbsp;</div><div id="folder11" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> For being humanoid computers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chobits</a></em> the specs of persocoms weren't so great.

For example, in one '90s strip the joke was that Dilbert and Wally were sending e-mail to each other despite their cubicles being right next to each other. Yes, that was considered funny all by itself. Also, when Adams started inserting his e-mail address into the strip in 1993, it was labeled "Internet ID" so newspapers wouldn't think it was an embedded advertisement. He further reports that much of the e-mail he got at the time essentially read "I contacted you because I don't know anyone else who has e-mail."</li><li> Some of the older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> comics are susceptible to this.

These days, you only have to wait a few seconds to get thousands of results back (in the book, a search routinely took hours). The trick isn't the speed, it's sifting through all the false positives.

An amusing interlude features the main character practicing writing backwards during downtime in class, and she notes that this is what she usually does at school when the projector breaks down.

While everyone else knows nothing about this and assumes Kirk is dead, Spock received a telepathic signal from Kirk and knows he's trapped in the past. A major plot point is Spock spending all his free time for <em>months</em> at the library computer, laboriously searching archived news story for any mention of Kirk. Finally, he finds a newspaper clipping on a story on an insane patient who calls himself "Captain James T. Kirk" and includes a picture of Kirk in his uniform.

For example, characters often carry PADDs around to hand to others in order to show them some information, because no equivalent to email seems to exist in the future. Similarly, all data seems to be tied to individual data rods, and whenever it needs to be transferred to another computer, that particular rod needs to be physically moved there. The idea that data could be copied to a server or transferred through a network doesn't seem to exist. Bizarrely, files could be <em>moved</em>, but rarely <em>copied</em>. Thus any given piece of data or software was fundamentally linked to some storage device. To be fair, many of these could be plausibly handwaved as security measures.</li><li> As for processing power, the android Data is stated as being capable of 60 teraflops, or 60 trillion operations per second. In the 80's when <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> premiered, this was 60,000 times faster than the most powerful supercomputers of the day. But by the 2010's, high-end computers have already surpassed 100 teraflops. Since <em>Star Trek</em> takes place in the 23rd century, this means Data (or at least his CPU) is 300 years obsolete. The memory capacity of a hundred petabyte is still above what we have today, but not that far... Data's torso packed up with the best Micro SD cards of 2018 would just about get there.</li></ul></li><li> Current viewers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> probably wonder why George doesn't just ebay that book he took into the bathroom with him at the bookstore.</li><li> Ditto for many of the plots on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>, many of which could have been avoided with cell phones or the Internet. In one, Chandler mentions the chaos he went through to get a birthday gift for a girl he likes, a rare first edition of <em>The Velveteen Rabbit.</em> He mentioned having to hunt through book stores and contacting the author's grandchildren. Nowadays, he could have easily found a copy of the book on eBay<ul><li> An infamous example of this is in Series 2, Episode 8 - The One With the List. Chandler boasts that his new laptop has: "12 MB of Ram, 500 MB harddrive, built in spread-sheet capabilities, and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 BPS (28 kbps, or about <em>3.5 KBps</em>, for the non-geeks out there)". Today, nobody even <em>makes</em> anything with specs that weak. For comparison, a reasonable computer today would be expected to have between 8 and 16 <em>Gigabytes</em> of RAM, 1 TB HDDs are common (even SSDs under 120GB are rare), the number of options for spreadsheet programs is bewildering, and connection speeds today are measured in <em>megabits</em> per second at a minimum. Considering Chandler's laptop was supposed to be top-of-the range, the equivalent today could have something like 32GB RAM (about 2600x more memory) and a 512 GB Solid-State Hard Drive (500 times bigger) with 4 TB HDD (<em>4000 times bigger</em>), and <em>2.8 Gigabits</em> (nearly a hundred thousand times faster) networking connections are not unusual.</li></ul></li><li> There are numerous situations in books, television and movies that simply could not happen today because of cellphones, GPS and surveillance/security cameras.</li><li> The season one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E8IRobotYouJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS1E8IRobotYouJane">I Robot, You Jane</a>", which was created right in the middle of the panic that online chat rooms were crawling with horrible perverts that wanted to kidnap you. Then there's the scene where Buffy doesn't quite catch on to Willow saying she met a guy online, thinking they were "on line" for something. Most amusingly, the demon Moloch ends up in a deliberately cheesy and ridiculous robot body to demonstrate how much he doesn't belong in modern times, except that it's almost impossible to pick this out from all the <em>un</em>intentional cheesy and ridiculous stuff around it.</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, it happens several times that a news story is about to break, and a character reports that it has already been published on the internet, which means that it will be reported by traditional media soon - the implication being that internet outlets themselves don't matter and are only relevant indirectly through their impact on traditional media outlets.

For one thing, current clock frequencies are well within the microwave range, and microwave electronics are <em>different</em>. There is also the matter of clock cycle length putting an upper bound on the physical size of the computing device, by speed of light.

Back when most everybody was on dialup, you only received a certain allocation of hours per month in order to keep network load within reasonable limits. Eventually AOL abandoned this and permitted users to remain logged on as long as they wanted. While this was great for users who could get a connection, AOL's network hit capacity very quickly and people had to wait in a queue for long periods of time- hours, even- for enough users to log off.

Mission control is up to date (where permitted) and when the scientists need to do actual work, they do it on modern laptops.</li><li> Any space mission has good reason to use rather primitive systems. Satellites and space probes have to operate for years, and the last maintenance most of them get is right before launch. Space is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">really harsh place</a>, so the hardware has to be as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">rugged as possible</a> &mdash; much easier to do when a system is kept simple. Programming and testing these systems is much more straightforward, and sending equivalently shorter commands is faster, more accurate, and more reliable, especially when the distant end is millions of miles away. Upgrading the system would cost a <em>lot</em> (and NASA is often subject to budget cuts), mostly due to the exponentially increased time required to test every single potential problem &mdash; problems that will prove fatal out in space.<ul><li> A lot of NASA's spacecraft are built with off-the-shelf equipment left over from previous missions (as spares, test articles, etc.). The space shuttle <em>Endeavour</em>, built as the replacement for <em>Challenger</em>, was almost entirely made of spare parts. To save both time and money, they use what's already been paid for, even if it is a little more primitive.</li></ul></li><li> To get a sense of how "behind the times" NASA is with selecting their parts, the Mars Curiosity Rover, launched in 2011, has a <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAD750">PowerPC-750 based CPU<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, 256MB of RAM, and 2GB of flash memory. This is slightly better than the original Apple iMac released in 1999. On the other hand, it's now into year 7 of it's two year mission and still working. How many of your devices do you still have that are seven years old? And how many of them are likely to have still been working after being shot 350 million miles into space?</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, nuclear power stations take a long time to update their controls software. Even hardware is rarely updated with new wiring on top of or combined with old wiring to build in additional levels of redundancy and security. Considering that, barring a complete shutdown and removal of all potentially radioactive material, the monitoring instruments and controls of a nuclear plant can <em>never be turned off</em> this is a good thing. Some plants refuse to upgrade, fearing that even the slightest error would cause a catastrophe.</li><li> Even more similarly, software. For instance, a lot of math based libraries for Python are based on the very old and "obsolete" Fortran and Pascal. They haven't updated the software because they have years and years use and acceptance. And plenty of other companies don't update old code unless it's absolutely necessary for this very reason.<ul><li> This is called "library code"; it's code that has been tested and works for the application it's used for. Many languages have libraries that are decades old so they don't have to reinvent the virtual wheel.</li><li> Also, FORTRAN is still in use for scientific programming. Yes, it's old. Yes, it's kind of clunky at dealing with things like text. But for pure number-crunching, it can be orders of magnitude faster than more modern languages ... programmers have had a <em>long</em> time to work on the optimizers, so optimized FORTRAN code will probably be faster than even assembly language except for the most basic tasks.</li></ul></li><li> And even some businesses. It would cost more to train the IT department (who has probably documented all issues for the past 20+ years) and the normal users of the program than it would to just keep the old system. Upgrading hardware doesn't tend to be an issue thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DOSBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DOSBox">DOSBox</a> and virtual machines now able to run on consumer level computers (unless you happen to need DOS to drive some ancient hardware that uses a connector that no longer exists on modern computers). But so help you if your entire system was on a PDP-8.<ul><li> IBM mainframes address this by having their OSes be entirely binary-compatible with their predecessors: It is possible to take a program written in 1970 on an 8-bit System 360 mainframe, and run it on a modern zSeries mainframe with almost no changes, and it is also possible to take a program written in 1990 on an AS/400 server and put it with no changes at all on a modern POWER7 server running the IBM i OS.</li></ul></li><li> In the early 1990s there were several big news stories about people who had heart attacks, strokes, etc and were saved by their online friends who called the person's home police department. The Internet is so prevalent today that while these stories can still make news, they aren't such a big deal anymore. And lots of old people get cellphones so that they can make their own 911 calls when they've fallen and they can't get up.</li><li> Most of the world's embedded devices (more basic than your cellphone), either uses Intel's 186 (1982), Intel's 8051 (1982) Freescale's 68MC000 (based on the Motorola 68000 from 1979), Zilog Z80 (1976), MOS 6502 (1975), and various 8-bit micro-controllers from PIC, AVR, etc. Why? Because they don't need features of a modern processor, they're simple to program, and they tend to use a lot less power (important for a sensor that needs to stay out for weeks without intervention). ARM has come out with cheap yet effective 32-bit micro-controllers, but it also comes with the complexities of such, so the 8-bit/16-bit guys will still be around for a while.</li><li> Anyone remember the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0">modem dialtone<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>?<ul><li> Fax machines don't seem to be going away just yet...</li></ul></li><li> Linguists &mdash; not that long ago &mdash; wondered where the various branches of English would go. Some people said that within 200 years or so, British and American English will have little in common. However, this was mostly said by aging linguistics scholars in the 1980s. Then the Internet came along, and we're talking to each other, watching each other's TV programs, talking live to each other on headsets as we play <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>... and it seems English is moving closer together rather than apart. Almost all similar languages are experiencing this now.<ul><li> The same effect is intensifying the pressure against minority languages. Except for those groups that are intentionally insular (living among people who speak a different mother tongue, but not <em>with</em> them) many minority language groups are finding themselves dying out faster than ever.</li><li> Rather weirdly, branches of major languages are coming <strong>closer</strong> due to modern media (albeit slowly, as the German spoken in Vienna has plenty of different words and a funny pronunciation compared to Standard German), while languages who evolve apart from modern media (regional dialects which are not taught in school and do not creep into TV or newspaper speech) are <strong>going away</strong> from standard language. Centralized school systems prior to 1980 forced the standard language on all social groups in a country, which no longer happens.</li></ul></li><li> The California Science Center in Los Angeles was originally built in 1913, and a massive expansion was done in 1998. The museum's technology exhibit seemingly hasn't been updated since that renovation &mdash; every screen in the exhibit hall is a cathode-ray tube, the CPU on display is an ancient Pentium, the description of e-mail and the Internet is highly archaic, and no discussion of video games at all. The transportation exhibit is just as outdated; the exhibit's example of clean transportation is a fuel-cell car (touted as the future in the 1990s) instead of a more realistic electric car (the problems with fuel cell vehicles haven't been solved, and electric vehicles are much more common now). However, given the speed at which technology advances, it may be unfeasible to keep updating these two exhibits, though an update once every five years should be enough.</li><li> Now that the world has fully embraced digital technology, anything that has the characteristics of analog medium (static, uneven synching of video, etc.) seems out of place.</li><li> It used to be that computers that people would normally used were dumb terminals that had to connect to a mainframe or servers as the "micro computer" or personal computer hadn't taken off yet (mostly because it was slow). Once hardware got powerful enough for a personal computer, this idea started to fade out. But now this is inverting itself as Internet speeds got fast enough. With "Cloud computing", a basic computer could have expanded storage to even playing high-end games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em> over an Internet browser.</li><li> There's an Internet exhibit at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry featuring a timeline of important events contributing to development of computers&mdash;and its most recent date is in 1999. As one could imagine, many elements of the exhibit are quite behind the times, such sections extolling the then-new wonders of downloading image and picture files from the Internet. To modern visitors, the whole thing feels like huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">Captain Obvious</a>.</li><li> Internet cafes. While they were somewhat common in the late '90s to early 2000s as Wi-Fi wasn't as readily available, the idea of needing to go to a public space and pay per hour just to go on the Internet on what is basically a public terminal seems odd and outdated, at least in most developed nations where computers are relatively affordable and home internet service readily available. Unless you're geeky enough to go for, having home internet limitations, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">living in Asia</a>.</li><li> Looking at the website for the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceJam">Space Jam</a></em>, which for some reason has been up since <strong>1996</strong>, is like observing a time capsule of website design from the mid-'90s.

It even still has a Yahoo! search field; Google didn't even exist back when the page was created.</li><li> The rise of online dating sites, social networking, and smartphone apps have had a negative affect on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereEverybodyKnowsYourFlame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereEverybodyKnowsYourFlame">gay bars</a> and bathhouses. Once considered sanctuaries of the community, they've been on the decline as GLBT people are less likely to feel the need to segregate themselves and endure "the scene" in order to socialize and find a mate. It can get annoying, however, if one actually enjoys going to such places...only to find everyone glued to their phones browsing Grindr.</li><li> Those who grew up with old 486 or XT computers might recall that some of them had a feature known as a 'Turbo' button, which would decrease the clock speed. One reason for this, rather than keeping the processor buzzing at its maximum speed all the time, was that certain programs, especially video games, were <em>coded to run at the speed of the computer's clock</em>. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheOregonTrail">The Oregon Trail</a></em> for DOS will now instantaneously zip through most of the game, bypassing most of the messages and making hunting an impossible feat. Fans of older DOS games can now use programs like DOSBox to run them and adjust the clock speeds manually, but without such tools, many games are simply unplayable.</li><li> DSL.

Nowadays, the only people that use DSL are people who live in very remote, rural areas, where cable and fiber Internet are not available (if they're unwilling to put up with the latency issues of satellite Internet), people from low-income households that literally can't afford to get anything faster (or else they would), and (generally older) people who use the Internet sparingly and thus don't feel a need to pay more money for broadband.</li><li> Webpages from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> tend to look clunky and dated today, because of the proliferation of higher-speed Internet, as well as improvements in web-design technology.</li><li> Inverted, this iteration of the trope was an issue in the unsuccessful plagiarism lawsuit over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TroubleWithTheCurve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TroubleWithTheCurve">Trouble with the Curve</a></em>.

Before IC chip memory, every single <em>bit</em> of RAM had to be built manually, which made the very idea of storing large amounts of data electronically pretty much absurd; if a computing device in fiction back then could store much data, it was probably a full-blown AI.

The format was already in its death throes while the movie was being made.

The text of every article, excluding discussion pages and edit histories, comes to about eight gigabytes; on a good broadband connection you could download that in a couple of hours.

However, it also made it a point to show that Old Detroit's police department stored its records on the most advanced technology (funded by OCP) &mdash; tape-to-tape reels, which are shown as taking up a massive amount of space in the department. This concept carried over to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoboCopTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoboCopTheSeries">the 1994 television series</a>, even though the series had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> aesthetic and computers were in the process of minaturization.</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanReturns">Batman Returns</a></em>, a big deal is made about the Batmobile having an on-board CD recorder. At the time, this seemed incredibly futuristic; now, after the rise of flash memory storage for music, it seems more pointless than anything else.

First and foremost is that the main storage media is 3.5" floppies. While Dade is fiddling with Kate's brand-new laptop, she mentions that it has an internal 28.8 kbps modem (an impressive amount at the time; for an internal modem, doubly so). The tech-savvy team of hackers mostly have pagers rather than cell phones. And also, the trick of using recorded dial tones to spoof pay phones into accessing pay-to-call numbers was obsolete even when the movie came out.</li><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WaynesWorld">Wayne's World</a></em>, Wayne puts a CD in his dashboard CD player and Cassandra asks him when he got a CD player. He responds "With the money!" (that he had gotten from selling the rights to his cable access show). Portable CD players then were still pricey and status symbols &mdash; cassette tapes were still big in 1991.</li><li> In the 1990 film <em>Taking Care of Business</em>, Jim Belushi plays an escaped prisoner. At one point, in a bid to flatter some guy, he acts all impressed by the guy's IBM PC, specifically mentioning, in awestruck terms, its "<em>20-megabyte</em> hard drive".<ul><li> Also, the entire plot hinges on the fact that Belushi's character is able to impersonate a stuck up advertising exec due to having found... his filofax.

Ironically one 1985 novel that takes place beginning in 2016 is the <em>least</em> affected, with networked computers, widespread personal cell phones, etcetera, while ones set 400 years later feature tapes and '80s style computers.

One of these, a "slate" that functions as an e-book reader, can store at least a hundred thousand words; not only is this a <em>much</em> lower capacity than a present-day Kindle or Nook, but it's hard to believe anyone from an orbital colony would've grown up reading <em>non</em>-digital books.</li><li> The novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> has the program which tracks the dinosaurs.

Kaitlin comments that the computer has an 8 GHz processor, a 1 terabyte hard drive, and... 512 megabytes of RAM. 8 GHz is just below the world record overclock as of 2013, with 4 GHz being about the maximum for high-speed CPUs, a 1 terabyte hard drive is a stock standard part in even budget computers, while 512 megabytes of ram is below the common stand of several gigabytes of RAM.</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E7Logopolis">Logopolis</a>" the highly advanced aliens who are holding the world together with pure mathematics use bubble memory. As the Doctor puts it, "Bubble memory is non-volatile. Remove the power and the bit patterns are still retained in tiny magnetic domains in these chips!" The writer was a computer scientist and bubble memory was quite cutting edge in 1981. Nowadays, not so much.

(He tricked an acquaintance into thinking they were watching the ball game together at the time of the murder.) Columbo was appropriately awed when Shatner showed the VCR off to him and explained how such a device would cost about three thousand dollars. (Today you can get a DVD player for less than a hundred dollars and that's without taking inflation into account.) At the end Columbo commented that it was "very brave" of Shatner to show him the VCR, saying "you certainly like to take a chance."<ul><li> A 1980s episode has Columbo fascinated with a fax machine in much the same manner.</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, a FBI computer expert tells Mulder and Scully that the information they got from... somewhere would be enough to fill "seven 10 gigabyte hard drives". Not one seventy gigabyte hard drive, no, "<em>seven ten gigabyte hard drives"</em>.<ul><li> This might be more subtle than it appears. Until the early 2000s, you had to make a rather strange choice in hard drives for big systems: You could go for the types of hard drives used in PCs (which were rapidly growing into the hundreds of gigabytes in size) or you could go for the smaller but faster SCSI drives, which were limited to 10 GB for a long time. The latter largely died out when the former got as fast as them.</li></ul></li><li> In a 1980 episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuckRogersInTheTwentyFifthCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuckRogersInTheTwentyFifthCentury">Buck Rogers</a></em>, Buck is put on trial for evidence taken from a Betamax videotape from 1987. The show seems to have assumed that VHS would have been supplanted by Sony's Betamax as the dominant video format by this time. In fact, by 1987, VHS had clearly won the format war, and in early 1988, Sony effectively surrendered when it announced the production of the company's first VHS-format VCRs. That said, Betamax didn't really die in the US until the mid-1990s, when Sony stopped selling blank tapes for it, and even had one more decade in Japan.<ul><li> On the other hand, the tape in question was never <em>specifically</em> referred to as a Betamax tape by any of the characters, so this is probably just a case of the production staff using whatever props they happened to have lying around at the time and figuring the viewers wouldn't notice or care. (Seeing as how this was one of the last episodes filmed before the series was cancelled, it's likely the production staff didn't care, either.)</li><li> This, of course, assumes that the videotape (and the equipment needed to play it) was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">either preserved or restored</a> in such a way as to render it playable five centuries into the future.

Vinyl lasted nearly one hundred years before being superseded by compact discs. Cassettes existed alongside vinyl for around twenty five years before compact discs again replaced them as the default. Compact discs themselves were only on top for around fifteen years before digital storage began to replace them. Hard drives (at least on portable models) lasted less than ten years &mdash; all modern music storage is on flash or similar memory.

Each physical format had a narrow window between invention and obsolescence.</li><li> Anyone remember Digital Audio Tape? Thought not. Think of them as digital 8-track tapes... Oh, you don't remember 8-tracks? DAT seemed to be around in the early 1990s in radio/audio, as a more stable digital recording format than CDs, which tended to scratch and skip. DATs were replaced by minidiscs. Oh, forget it... <br><br>DAT and MD (MiniDisc) hit the market at roughly the same time. DAT died fairly swiftly in the consumer-audio world due to the RIAA throwing a hissy-fit over how its ability to make perfect bitwise copies would promote piracy (sound familiar) and threatening lawsuits if it was marketed to consumers, but it hung around in the professional-audio world for quite a while, and as a data-storage and backup format as well. The MD, on the other hand, was quite popular in Asia and Europe, but didn't do well in the US due mostly to some mis-aimed marketing by Sony which made people think MD was supposed to replace the CD, at a point in the early '90s when most people hadn't even finished making the leap from LP to CD yet, when what it really was, was the logical successor to <em>cassettes</em> because you could record and erase them at will on a portable device, which couldn't be done with CDs back then. <br><br><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4K1QKKPX_g">Here is an excellent video on DAT<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by Techmoan. The guy has a lot of interesting videos about old tech, especially old audio tech. It's worth checking out.</li><li> A common complaint about "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">obsolete computer entities we still use</a>" (the fifty-cent term for which is 'skeuomorphisms') is the floppy disk icon for saving. A lot of people probably don't even know what it is now.<ul><li> The 3.5" floppy disk, which topped out at a whopping 1.44MB, was briefly superseded by a number of removable disk formats such as "floptical" drives and, most notably, the Iomega Zip drive, which started off with a whopping 100 MB per disk and eventually expanded to 750 MB! Zip drives even became standard equipment on Power Macintoshes and other workstations alongside the old 3.5" floppy and CD drives. However, the widespread adoption of CD burners for mass removable storage quickly put an end to those floppy drive alternatives, as did later USB Mass Storage drives.</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, various attempts were made to replace the floppy<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15e8c8');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note15e8c8" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15e8c8');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Wikipedia has a breakdown <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk_variants">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> </span>. Like Betamax, Zip drives, "superdisks" (aka LS-120), Jaz Drives and other removable media all died as CDs became cheaper. Zip disks had technical problems, Jaz drives were expensive and the LS-120 (as souped-up floppy disk) was slow, and portable storage today is taken care of by either cheap USB drives, or cloud-based storage like Dropbox or Google Drive, which eliminates even the need to carry a physical object around. Around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a> Apple just removed floppy drives altogether, other computer makes followed suit.</li><li> Funnily enough, it feels like optical disks are going this route, due to the cheapness of external hard drives and the capacity of thumb disks. When was the last time someone asked you to burn them a CD/DVD for data?<ul><li> That is, unless you work for the US Government or in a high-security section of a technology company, who often avoid the fundamental security flaws of USB by disabling the ports altogether. CD/DVD burning is usually the go-to media since malicious programs can't download without the user or security programs knowing.</li></ul></li><li> Some Linux GUIs have taken note of this and use an arrow pointing at a hard drive.</li><li> A debatable example happens on Android, which often uses a microSD card as a save icon, as microSD cards have been the de facto standard removable storage used on Android cell phones. However, as of 2014, Google began to attempt to go down the iPhone route of making the phone a completely sealed device with fixed battery and no SD card slot and applied this design pattern to its Nexus phone and the Motorola Moto X. Nobody followed suit at first, but then 2015 saw Samsung's flagship model, the Galaxy S6, being released with no removable storage and battery. And now Samsung had presented its S7, and it has the SD slot back, so no idea whether the tendency will go anywhere.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> uses an icon of an arrow pointing down at a <em>file cabinet</em> &mdash; although any real Emacs user knows the toolbar is for newbies, and that the proper way to save a file is by pressing Control-x Control-s, or Control-x Control-w to "save as".<ul><li> Similarly, Lotus SmartSuite, last updated in 2002, uses an icon of an arrow pointing into a <em>file folder</em>. Naturally, in its successor Symphony, ever-state-of-the-art Lotus has replaced that icon with...a floppy disk.</li><li> LibreOffice has also reverted to the floppy disk icon as of version 4.</li></ul></li><li> Computer Science has a trend on this:<ul><li> Hard Disks are usually represented as a tall cylinder on disk activity LEDs. There haven't been hard disks shaped like this in <em>decades</em>. Similarly, some logical HDD addressing schemes still use <em>cylinders</em>, heads and sectors.</li><li> Eventually, hard disks themselves will be this trope, as solid-state drives are making headway &mdash; although SSDs' uptake will continue to be limited by the fact that flash memory can't be written non-destructively, meaning that every time you save a file to that shiny new SSD, you're measurably shortening its remaining lifetime. Mechanical hard disks, in spite of those who disparage them as "spinning rust", have no such inherent limitation; especially when power cycles are avoided (i.e., the disk is kept constantly spinning, which is actually <em>easier</em> on the hardware than stopping and restarting it would be) it's not unusual for a server-class hard disk to remain continuously in service for ten years or more.</li></ul></li><li> Some PCs identify Ethernet ports with an icon showing 2 or more PCs connected to a single line. The <em>bus</em> architecture represented by such icon is no longer in use, and current Ethernet interfaces <em>don't even work like that anymore</em>.</li><li> Virtual architecture still reflects the designs of yesteryear. On Microsoft OSes, A:\ used to be the floppy directory, because the first few editions of MS-DOS had to be booted from a floppy. Because the floppy had to remain in the drive, if you wanted to move something out of your computer you required a second floppy drive, which was B:\; if you had a hard drive, it would get mounted to C:\. Today, floppy disks are long obsolete, but on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MicrosoftWindows">Windows</a> the default hard drive directory remains C:\, and poorly written programs will often malfunction if for some reason you didn't choose C:\ as your system partition's letter. The convention of having filenames end with a three letter filetype also comes from the old days of MS-DOS, which limited filenames to 8 letters and a 3-letter filetype.<ul><li> In fact both conventions came from an even older system, Digital Research's CP/M, which Microsoft copied to facilitate porting of popular CP/M programs to MS-DOS.</li></ul></li><li> The traditional UNIX convention of putting system programs in the /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin and /opt directories comes from the third edition of Ritche and Thompson's Research UNIX, which required four hard drives to store the core system programs and usually had an extra hard drive for user-provided programs. Some Linux distributions have simplified this layout by merging at least some of these directories &mdash; for example, Arch Linux and its derivatives dropped /bin, /sbin, and /usr/sbin in favor of merging them with /usr/bin.</li><li> Data centers still use magnetic tape drives for data storage. However, that's because it is much easier in general to save data to a long, slow-moving sequential tape than it is to save data to a platter that spins at 5600-7200 RPM &mdash; as of 2015, it is not uncommon to see a single tape cassette being able to stash more than 150 terabytes of data. Because magnetic tapes have the limitation of having to rewind or fast forward the tape in order to find the required data, they are usually used for backups and data archival.<ul><li> There are other reasons for this besides the volume they are capable of storing. The first reason is simple, a magnetic tape casette has fewer moving parts (just the spools) and has less risk of mechanical failure over time. The second reason is that, when properly stored in a cool and dry environment, magnetic tape will last far longer than other mediums.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Unfortunately for John Logie Baird, his <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonovision">AVD<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was a no-starter. Still, recording an actual image on something other than a roll of film was really something for the 1920s.<ul><li> Around the same time the leading Soviet electronics magazine, "The Radio", discussed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">recording</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">mechanical</a></span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">TV programs</a> on the blank phonograph disks or celluloid tape, <em>with sound</em>.</li></ul></li><li> In 1956, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/photos/technology/storage.asp">this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was the modern day equivalent of a flash drive.<ul><li> Never mind the size, note the price &mdash; it <em>leased</em> for $3200 1956 dollars a month, which in 2018 dollars is about $30,000 &mdash; <em>it cost literally one luxury sedan a month</em>.</li></ul></li><li> As of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">motion pictures are still often called ''films''</a>, despite the fact that a large number are no longer shot on or projected with film. Similarly, directors often talk about <em>filming a scene</em>.<ul><li> Editing is done digitally now, but we still use terms like <em>left on the cutting room floor</em>. Traditional animation is sometimes still called <em>cel animation</em> although actual cels have mostly been replaced by digital ink and paint.</li><li> The term <em>celluloid</em> is often used in reference to cinema, particularly the phrase <em>on celluloid</em>. They stopped making film stock out of highly flammable celluloid in the 1950s.</li></ul></li><li> As anyone with eternal (or near-eternal) archive legal requirements knows, in the '80s, it was popular to microfilm important documents for easier mass storage. As anyone trying to digitize these archives knows, these neat, little microfilms are a pain in the neck to use and quite time consuming to transfer to computer.<ul><li> Some universities still have a lot of their library information on microfilm, as they either don't have the resources or it's too much of trouble to transfer it all.</li></ul></li><li> Brazil had a magazine called <em>Revista do CD-ROM</em> (Magazine of the CD-ROM), which had an attached CD with programs. 15 years and 175 issues later, it evolved into <em>Revista do DVD-ROM</em> in 2010. Then in 2013 it became <em>Revista dos Apps</em>, ditching the bonus media for only web and computer journalism.</li><li> In his landmark 1945 essay "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>", Vannevar Bush predicted many technologies we take for granted today, like a desk-mounted appliance (i.e., home computer) that gives the user access to vast sums of human knowledge quickly (i.e., the World Wide Web), and the ability to cross-reference related terms instantly (i.e., hypertext). But he thought the total of human knowledge would still be stored on microfilm.</li><li> Interestingly, storage for MP3 players has actually regressed a bit nowadays. Around 2005-2008 it was possible to buy them with capacities in excess of 40GB; the iPod Classic, for example, was released with capacities of 80, 120 and 160 GB. This trend reversed quite quickly because A) your average Joe from that time didn't usually have more than 4 GB of music in total, B) the only way to achieve this was using 2.5-inch hard drives, the kind with moving parts which don't tolerate rough handling very well, and C) as wireless broadband connections developed, your average Joe stopped saving his music on his portable device and began to just stream it from Spotify &mdash; no hunting for your favorite songs, no dealing with a cumbersome file sharing program, no having to put up with virus infections spread through P2P networks, no having to maintain an entire music collection, you just search for your artist, touch Play and It Just Works.<ul><li> Until the song suddenly cuts out because the smartphone's Internet data connection just dropped while driving around &mdash; cellular networks are hardly reliable with their coverage, which makes the lack of high-capacity storage options on devices without SD card slots painful, especially now that one can buy microSD cards with 200 GB and more &mdash; well beyond what any iPod ever shipped with, and all on efficient solid-state flash memory!</li></ul></li><li> Around 1978 <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_memory">bubble memory<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> was touted as the Next Big Thing.

Tape is often considered obsolete, but it remains by far the dominant medium used for backups and long term storage due to its low price and very good long-term stability. Solid-state storage has become ubiquitous in mobile platforms, but its high price means hard drives still dominate in areas where mobility or speed aren't the main requirements - almost all servers and cloud storage, as well as things like bulk storage in PCs, are predicted to remain on magnetic hard disks well into the 2020s at the very least.<ul><li> In addition, flash storage has issues with long-term stability (know as "bit rot"), making it unsuitable for archive storage. This means tape is likely to remain in use in the foreseeable future, even after hard drives have become obsolete.</li></ul></li></ul></div><p></p><h2>Computer Interface</h2>Old computer interfaces certainly didn't look like a modern one; computer programs came in the form of punch cards, and they were ugly.

The operators must specifically learn to read these.<ul><li> Those would be <em>analog computers</em>. Unlike <em>digital</em> computers, which solve scientific problems by number-crunching (not unlike manual computations on paper), analog computers compute by forming an electrical circuit whose behaviour matches the mathematical formula of interest. The output device was typically an oscilloscope or a roll of graph paper. Due to imperfections in the electrical components (in particular, they tend to be sensitive to temperature) the results were always only approximate, but the same is true for slide rules. The number of components needed to do useful scientific calculations with analog computers are orders of magnitude lower than for digital computers, so before integrated circuits were invented, analog computers were a more natural match for manned spacecraft.</li><li> Also the spaceship's computer (The Predictor) is designed to actually fly the ship &mdash; until it gets into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket">Asteroid Thicket</a> and it begins to manoeuver like a crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> fighter pilot to avoid them.

This let the actors look like they were controlling the ship entirely through a touch interface, and that touching the same small series of buttons could read out numerous different functions. The catch is, back when this was first envisioned, Windows had only just begun its fight in becoming the most preferred interface to use for computers, so all the starships and computers in the future are run by what is basically a touch screen version of DOS.<ul><li> This in turn, was intentionally inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> by history and pop culture enthusiast Tom Paris. When given the task of inventing a new type of shuttle craft for Voyager, he intentionally designed the cockpit with an entire section of knobs, switches, and a flight stick to control the craft with <em>because</em> of the nostalgic feel it gave, despite being pointed out by Tuvok that it was functionally unnecessary since the LCARS was still just as efficient. Paris also included this because he was well aware that the computers <em>could</em> fail, and having a flight stick for manual control would allow him to fly the craft better during an emergency.<ul><li> Manual backups only make sense if you have manual flight controls. Modern jet fighters have flight sticks that are connected to computers.

While commonplace up until the early '90s, they're a mystery to the mainstream world, so much so that some people actually think such interfaces are magical tools capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">Hollywood Hacking</a>. Which is actually kinda-sorta-somewhat true; a well-used CLI handily outdoes a GUI for whole categories of tasks &mdash; like, say, making a text file listing everything in a given directory, or batching a hundred repetitive jobs into one single instruction.<ul><li> For the curious, the UNIX command to write a file listing everything in a directory is <em>ls &gt; output.txt</em> &mdash; Windows is similar, <em>dir &gt; output.txt</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17n2id');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note17n2id" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17n2id');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">From the command prompt. What do you mean, what's a command prompt?</span>. Handy tip &mdash; Shift-right-click on a folder allows you to open a command prompt at that folder... with Windows 7, at any rate. How long before <em>that</em> is declared obsolete?</li><li> Command-line interfaces are still widely used for accessing and maintaining remote servers (especially UNIX servers). These servers often don't have even any kind of display hardware. An experienced system administrator will usually find the CLI significantly more flexible, expressive and powerful than any kind of graphical administrative tool (which by its very nature will often be limited in functionality). A CLI is like writing in a scripting language on-the-fly. (Many Linux/UNIX users, especially those with decades of experience, will also often use the CLI even on their local computers for maintenance and other tasks.)<ul><li> Even GUI-intensive operating systems like Mac OS X, Apple iOS and Android will sometimes require some command line fiddling for advanced tasks or when fixing issues. For example, if the media file scanner is eating way too much of your Android phone's battery, you have to open a command line, type <em>ps | grep mediaserver</em>, find the process ID of the <em>mediaserver</em> process, then type <em>lsof | grep &lt;mediaserver's process ID&gt;</em> and delete the file that is hanging the media scanner.</li></ul></li><li> Go up to a server running a VMWare ESXi host and you may be surprised that everything is operated from a simple text-based menu with an option to access a command line. The justification for this is that the simple interface will allow the server more resources to run its virtual machines.</li><li> Cisco's Internetwork Operating System (IOS) used on their professional routers &amp; network switches is a command line interface, so most hardware resources can go to actual network function.</li></ul></li><li> Linux and UNIX-like operating systems have lots of holdovers from as far as the early days of Dennis Ritche and Ken Thompson's Research UNIX. The physical terminals, for example, are known as <em>ttyX</em> because the first few text terminals were teletypes ([TTYs) &mdash; electric typewriters connected to the system that physically printed out program output and sent key presses to the computer. The idea of putting all executables under /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and /usr/sbin was because the third edition required four hard drives to store the entire suite of system commands. The <em>dd</em> command's syntax was designed to mimic that of a similar IBM mainframe command. UNIX-like operating systems that officially stick to the Single UNIX Specification such as IBM AIX and Mac OS X have their basic commands perform exactly like the old System V UNIX commands of yesteryear (unlike Linux, whose basic commands usually have much more functionality).</li><li> The pioneers of the Modern Internet as it grew by bounds in the 1990s assumed their children would use desktops with keyboards and mice &mdash; that's still around of course, but many people in the 2010s are enjoying sitting on the couch (or toilet) or lying on their bed as they interface with their portable tablet or smartphone through WiFi and a touch and swipe interface.<ul><li> For business and technical use, no replacement technology has come close to the effectiveness, versatility, and efficiency of the mouse-and-keyboard combination.</li></ul></li><li> Interface changes have rendered a number of programming languages (many developed at MIT for reasons related to one of the things that helped kill them) effectively unusable. A whole group of languages were developed that required a wide range of exotic characters to be typable from the keyboard, usually using a special keyboard known as the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/space-cadet-keyboard.html">Space Cadet Keyboard<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. This interesting (and obsolete) interface had a total of seven different keys that performed functions analogous to the Shift, Control, and Alt keys on a modern keyboard, allowing direct typing of over 8000 distinct characters (using double-width key codes, this thing produced 14 bit keycodes in an era when 7 bits was the norm). This keyboard was invented at MIT, and was used on many machines there, and the design influenced the development of dense, symbol-laden languages like APL. (The Space Cadet Keyboard dying out in favor of IBM-style keyboards helped kill languages like APL, as did their extreme lack of readability and difficulty of debugging. The poem "There are two things a man must do before this life is done, write two lines of APL and make the buggers run" isn't really a jest.)<ul><li> As an example, the notoriously hotkey-heavy and unwieldy (on modern keyboards) interface of the aforementioned GNU Emacs, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">called in jest</a> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">Escape-Meta-Alt-Control-Shift</a>", among others, was directly influenced by the Space Cadet Keyboard, because its author Richard Stallman happens to hail from MIT. All those escape characters and modifier keystrokes? &#151; there was a dedicated key for any of it!</li></ul></li><li> Universal Serial Bus (USB) and Serial ATA (SATA) killed off a lot of connectors. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Card">PCMCIA<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI">SCSI<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, most of the "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port">serial<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" and "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_port">parallel<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>" connectors. Before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> it was common for printers, cameras and other devices to have special connectors so they could be hooked into a computer. Some programs required a "dongle" to run, lose it and your software won't work. Copy protection schemes advanced as did connectors. Aside from Apple, most now use USB and most drives use SATA. Dongles are a thing of the past.<ul><li> USB <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopyProtection">DRM dongles</a> are still a thing &mdash; just ask anyone who owns Steel Beasts Pro PE or the FAA-certified version of X-Plane!<ul><li> Or any IT support staff at large enterprises who have to manage specialist enterprise software like <em>WGIM Nexus</em> or <em>Intergraph PV Elite</em>.</li></ul></li><li> A quite common connector-that-no-longer-exists problem is the parallel port, commonly used for printers before USB came along. There are a <em>lot</em> of high-end laser printers out there in commercial and industrial installations that will last for decades (because they were both very well made and were designed to be repairable). The solution is the USB-to-parallel adapter, essentially a parallel port that connects to USB. You can also gets USB adapters for serial, base-T ethernet, and just about anything else you can imagine.</li><li> Ironically despite the ubiquity of USB and the extinction of parallel ports, there are <em>still</em> headers for a standard RS-232 port if you really need one. From 2005 to roughly 2009 mainboards with parallel ports were practically extinct, none could be found in ordinary shops. After 2009, producers brought back the classic mainboard configuration (2 serial ports, 1 parallel port, 4 to 8 USB ports, 1 PS/2 port), due to public demand. This is because their underlying circuitry is <em>very</em> simple &mdash; so simple, that college sophomores are often tasked with designing a serial port as final assignment for their Intro to digital electronics courses &mdash; which means that if you're a DIY tinkerer or an embedded system developer, chances are that your microcontroller will have out-of-the-box support for RS-232 signaling with dedicated pins that will make it very easy to talk to a computer or other devices.<ul><li> Another likely reason why RS-232 ports are still around: UNIX and Linux may, by default, dump out console output to it. Even at a horrendously low speed by today's standards (9600 baud, or 9.6kbits per second), it's still sufficient enough to provide <em>some</em> way to see what's going on in the system. Cisco Systems network appliances are also by default configured via a port that has an Ethernet jack but actually communicates with RS-232 signals, which is used to enter the device's command line when the configuration is totally blank and the network interfaces don't even have an IP address.</li></ul></li><li> Apple went all-in on deprecating their old ADB port, RS-422 serial ports, SCSI and floppy drives with the original iMac, quickly necessitating the rise of USB and IEEE 1394 FireWire peripherals to either adapt or replace old Macintosh equipment.</li><li> SATA may quickly be joining the list of legacy ports as an interface designed for old spinning-platter hard drives in an age of increasing proliferation of solid-state drives. Modern SSDs are starting to abandon SATA in favor of a PCI-Express interface for bandwidth reasons, which has culminated in high-performance SSDs taking the form of PCIe expansion cards, SATA Express and M.2 slot cards.</li><li> AGP ports have been made extinct by PCI-Express ports, while PCI has generally been reduced to a single 'legacy' port on new chipsets, with various types of PCI-Express being used for the majority of slots on a motherboard.</li><li> Even before PCI, you had ISA and MCA on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IBMPersonalComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IBMPersonalComputer">PCs</a>, NuBus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Macs</a>, Zorro slots on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommodoreAmiga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CommodoreAmiga">Amigas</a>, and various other expansion card interfaces that were all eventually deprecated by PCI.</li></ul></li><li> The traditional computer interface, aside from the keyboard and mouse, used to be a huge CRT (cathode ray tube) monitor. The LCD and plasma display have surpassed the CRT. They are lighter, use less energy and can be wall mounted without a lot of hardware.<ul><li> It also used to be common to consider televisions and computer monitors as separate devices, with the former being low-resolution and over-sized so that they can be seen from far away, and the latter being smaller and higher-res for viewing up close. HDTV and the transition to digital TV signals over analog has nearly eliminated this distinction, and most LCD "TV's" sold nowadays are pretty much just monitors with speakers, a TV tuner, a remote, and some legacy audio/video ports tacked on. And they can still be used with a computer just by hooking up the right cable and pressing a button.</li><li> Home theater used to be a big honkin' projection TV or a large CRT. Now LCD projectors and large LCD/plasma TV have killed off projection and CRT's. A serious home theater setup can be had for half the price of even the cheapest large CRT's.<ul><li> With the old home theater system getting replaced by wall-mounted televisions and smaller peripheral devices, entertainment centers, the furniture that would hold these, are no longer selling nearly as well as they used to.</li></ul></li><li> Even with the proliferation of modern flat-panel displays, CRTs are still favored by retrocomputing and retrogaming enthusiasts because modern multi-sync monitors don't have native resolutions that must be rescaled to with a major impact on image quality, are devoid of input lag normally imposed by a display scaler, had refresh rates well in excess of 60 Hz long before LCDs caught up, and have perfect viewing angles, among other reasons. There are people who still keep around aperture grille CRT monitors that were once top-of-the-line professional graphics monitors and use them with modern computers in 2016, despite the phasing-out of analog VGA ports on graphics cards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter">because they're simply better than flat-panel displays at any price today</a> &mdash; just ask anyone who owns a coveted Sony GDM-FW900, one of the last CRT professional graphics monitors made around 2002-2003, and a <em>widescreen</em> one to boot. People will still pay a pretty penny to get one in working order, and even if it's $1,000, that would still be a bargain for what was once a $2,500 top-of-the-line monitor.</li></ul></li><li> Despite all the stereotypes about Japan being on the edge of technology, most of the economy is still being run by older generations who refuse to upgrade technology in a country that is already notorious for refusing to adapt to just about anything. In fact, the country that is modern and on the edge of technology is the USA, and all those modern Korean and Japanese contraptions sold in the USA are just Asian corporations cashing on Americans' undying love for what hasn't even been released yet. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_20118_5-things-nobody-tells-you-about-living-in-japan.html">This Cracked article has no qualms about shattering the illusions of many a Japanophile of how incredibly modern the country must be<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> by pointing out that most banks do not have outdoor <em>ATMs</em>; many businesses do not accept credit cards of any sort; and most businesses still operate using fax machines, paper, and a good old-fashioned no. 2 pencil. Much like the NASA examples listed above, many computers being used in businesses are likely to be primitive '80s or pre-Windows 95 systems just because they know that the systems work.

It relied on an ISA card that connected to a graphics card with a VESA feature connector and also hosted a motion-sensing Cyberpuck controller through an ACCESS.bus port &#151; a standard that was ultimately displaced by USB.<ul><li> Keep in mind that in the mid-1990s, PCs were already transitioning to PCI to replace the old ISA interface, and newer 3D-accelerated cards like the 3dfx Voodoo Graphics card had no VESA feature connector, only a VGA passthrough, making the VFX1 incompatible with the big push in 3D graphics it direly needed as a stereoscopic HMD.</li><li> Also note that competitors like the Virtual i-O i-glasses! VPC only needed VGA, DB-9/RS-232 serial, and 3.5mm TRS audio input/output connections to the host computer; it's more of a cable mess, but also far more compatible with later PC hardware to the point that you could even play in 3D with it using the NVIDIA 3D Stereo drivers.</li></ul></li><li> It used to be common for employees in the US and Europe to "punch in" via a mechanical clock (hence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockHero">Punch-Clock Hero</a>). That changed to an electronic clock/computer and the "time cards" with the "punches" became computer files. Some companies even let employees use an app on their phone or just their fingerprints on a scanner.</li></ul></div><p></p><h2>Other</h2>Other computer peripherals have come and gone over the years as well.<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder44');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film &#151; Live-Action&nbsp;</div><div id="folder44" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> The C-3PO expy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a></em> is named Dot Matrix. At the time the movie was made, that was the most commonly used style of printer in the computer industry. They stopped making dot matrix printers back in the nineties (replaced by inkjet and laserjet), so people who weren't old enough to watch the movie within a decade of its first release likely won't get the joke. (Additionally, "Dot" has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutdatedName">stopped being a fairly common nickname for Dorothy</a>, although since she was meant to be matronly that may have been intentional.)</li></ul></div><p></p><hr>
