Its inhabitants, the Terragens, the mind-children of humanity, are all forms of life and all kinds of minds that trace their origins back to Earth.</p><p>The Terragen Bubble is mainly divided into a dozen or so "Sephirotic Empires", each one a staggeringly diverse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetOfHats">Star Cluster of Hats</a>. These are ruled by the Archailects, intelligences so powerful that they become, to the comprehension of an average human, indistinguishable from gods. Mostly, they're benevolent and very protective of their citizens, using extremely subtle methods to govern their charges, such as stopping crimes before they happen.</p><p>Life is common, but independently evolving intelligent life is very rare <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1t0op');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1t0op" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1t0op');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">all told there are about few dozen completely alien species known and more suspected, some without as much diversity as Terragens, others with even more</span>. Most species that other sci-fi series would classify as "alien" are actually <em>humans</em> or other Earth lifeforms modified heavily, or human-origin artificial intelligences &mdash; hence the term 'Terragen'.

The xenosophont J'Ta'ush are an entire species of virtual aliens created to interface with the outside world by their creator race, the Nu'Lu'j, possibly due to extreme xenophobia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>: This happens a lot to the more powerful AI gods. They used to try to convince people that they are not, in fact, divine, but decided to screw that and let them believe what they want instead around the year 3000 AT. Most people acknowledge that they aren't really gods in the classical sense, but also that it doesn't much matter; when the entirety of a habitat, a planet, or even an entire star is a person with intelligence, resources, and capabilities far outstripping a baseline, not calling the higher singularities gods is mostly left to the theologists to nitpick over.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">A.I. Is a Crapshoot</a>: Averted in most cases; while AI is depicted as normal intelligence which would have little or no reason to harm humans or humankind, some exceptions exist. Most notable is GAIA, who expelled most of humanity from Earth early in the setting's history. And there were human-indifferent or -hostile AIs early in history, whose descendants control major regions; the Sephirotics can be defined as those AI regions that are at least mildly benevolent to human rights and welfare.<ul><li> Played straight with the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/page/234">Eye in the Sky<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/464e6c641ffc7">Abaddon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> that destroyed all of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaker">created</a> species simply because they wanted to start over with a clean slate.</li><li> Played straight with many xenosophonts who have cultural taboos against AI from events in their past, and especially with the extinct <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4801367969609">Doreens<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, as the biological Doreens were destroyed by a thermonuclear war after they developed AI, and are survived by a transapient AI that still exists in the system and absolutely refuses to talk to anything biological.</li><li> Subverted (again) with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/56a10e1f0ef58">the Jesters<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, whose own AI destroyed them after the Jesters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">committed genocide as a prank</a>, much to the relief of the surrounding empires. But since the only records about them come from the Muuh, it's not clear that the Jesters ever existed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienArtsAreAppreciated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienArtsAreAppreciated">Alien Arts Are Appreciated</a>: Averted, in that alien minds work very differently, and most of the time their arts can't be appreciated by other species.<ul><li> The To'ul'h tradition of Polmusic, essentially political debate mixed with opera somehow, is completely lost on most terragens.</li><li> A mollusc provolve once wrote a poem entitled <em>Ode To Twenty Cubic Centimeters of Lovely Sandy Mud</em>, which was received very well among those who could relate, and largely ignored by those who couldn't.</li><li> The imaginative Muuh tend to mix history and fiction, creating a tales collectively known as "historifics". For human eyes, their visual displays are monochrome and have poor resolution. They may also use "tactile ideograms" to represent ideas.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">Aliens Speaking English</a>: Averted and played straight in various cases.<ul><li> While the majority of intelligent aliens can communicate with Terragens through various translation methods, only a few biological species even have the anatomical equipment necessary for human-style vocalization. Of those, one species, the To'ul'hs, are known to have members that can speak Arabic; however, even they require some technological assistance to adequately replicate the sounds of the language.</li><li> An interesting variation occurs: Most terragen species speak languages descended from English, such as the trader language of Douh. These are collectively called Anglic languages, though ten thousand years is a long time for a language to develop. Anglic languages are more diverse than current earth languages. Other modern languages such as Mandarin have their own families of descended languages as well, Anglic are just the most common.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyIdiot">Almighty Idiot</a>: The Animin are a class of transapients that have all the powers and capabilities typical of most ascended beings, but do not exhibit a rational, self-aware mindset. They generally are instinctive beings, and behave more like wild animals than humans or other sapient lifeforms, and are sometimes called Elementals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>: A transapient AI in the second millennium AT were worried that Terragen think too much alike, due to the inherent biases of their creators. So they created the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/xcms.php?r=oaeg-view-article&amp;egart_uid=47e9add0e5e11">Bitenic Squids<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, a highly diverse clade with every newborn member being a blank slate. Those that can function in the wider world are all completely selfish and without empathy, and go insane easily.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a>: The Muuh had supposedly come to SolSys a very long time ago, leaving artifacts on Titan. Given how unsuited Earth is for them, though, they probably didn't come down here.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BashBrothers">Bash Brothers</a>: Clades <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47eafcfdee06a">Faber<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47f6e514ba394">Tavi<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> have a long history of working together on the Periphery or other frontier environments, to the point where they are considered symbiotic species. The Faber vecs are level headed and more patient while the meerkat-derived Tavi are impulsive but fantastic in a crisis; both are driven by curiosity and a tendency for later settlers to push them out to always go further afield, often being the first pioneers of a system.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">The Beautiful Elite</a>: Clade Labela is the embodiment of this trope in the OA. Being stunningly beautiful can be achieved by commonly available genetic modification and other augmentations, but this clade goes a step further to make sure they are appreciated by adhering to mandatory scarceness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>: Most aliens in this setting are in no way compatible with earth-like habitats. Though in a subversion, the classic sci-fi example of silicon based life is almost completely unheard of; the only instance that's ever been found were some very slow moving crystals that were about as intelligent as anemones, (until they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal">provolved</a>, naturally).<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://orionsarm.com/eg-topic/4802a95fb92f2">To'ul'h<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are vaguely bat-like aliens from a "wet greenhouse" planet (similar to Venus, though cooler and with water). A To'ul'h on earth would die from freezing, alkaline burns, UV radiation, suffocation, and decompression,</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://orionsarm.com/eg-topic/45bd5c0041e98">Muuh<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> look like crabs and come from a planet similar to Titan, meaning it's cold enough for hydrocarbons like methane to be liquids. Their biochemistry is based on liquid hydrocarbons instead of water. A Muuh on Earth would literally melt and/or vaporize.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://orionsarm.com/eg-article/462d55832c31b">Daharrans<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are considered "humanoid" solely because they breathe earth-like air (they are crustacean/mammal-like), and they're the some of the only aliens found out of dozens of civilizations that can do so.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://orionsarm.com/eg-article/4d5c089a6e306">Magvivistem Hyperpolity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is also incredibly strange, though technically created by Terragens.

Within the Terragen sphere, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">"Singularities"</a> are defined as the threshold at which an intelligence becomes so smart that anything below that line cannot possibly comprehend their thought processes (and there are entities as high as S6). Indeed, this is one of the primary sources of conflict between modosophonts and S1 and higher entities; it's simply too complex to simplify to a point where a S0 can understand it, any more than you could explain a rocket ship to a rodent.<ul><li> Subverted with the To'ul'hs; although the differences in their biology mean that To'ul'hs have some cultural quirks that are alien to Terragens, such as their combination of song and politics in 'polmusic' or their reliance on echolocation instead of sight, To'ul'hs are remarkably similar to Terragens psychologically. In the long history of To'ul'hs, an analogue of virtually every form of Terragen philosophy, religion, and politics has existed, to the point where they are sometimes referred to as "humanity's twin".</li><li> The Muuh are the other most prominent aliens in the setting, and because of their ice-based biology, they move at a literally glacial pace; were they sped up to human reaction times, they would "likely be viewed as nearly hyperactive romantics", and the average Muuh lives a life in a quiet village where things have operated by tradition since long before humans ever used a tool. But below their seemingly idyllic existence, the Muuh have many odd quirks about their society that they refuse to discuss, dubbed the Muuh Taboo, and from as far as people can tell in-universe, it seems to be genetically ingrained into them.

Beyond that, other features such as the Muuh's disdain of AI, mysterious pylons covered in magmatter (a material they can't create in the current era), and finding their "remnants" were actually much more extensive than previously thought makes the Muuh far more complex than at first glance.</li><li> The Meistersingers are loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>. While the Muuh have been around for a long time, a lot of their history is lost or confused; the Meistersingers on the other hand know a lot about the broader Milky Way but refuse to tell Terragens about it, since it would deny them the "Joy of Discovery". Add to that the fact that they seem like modosophont pacifists and their ships don't look all that special, but that they've traveled so far indicates they're almost certainly bristling with weapons. And telescopic observations of the broader Milky Way show that <em>multiple</em> empires on par with the Terragen Sphere show the same sort of trajectory as the Meistersinger fleet and that they've come from the galactic core and... well there's certainly a lot about them that remains to be discovered, joyfully or not.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a>: Borderline case.

Most other alien civilizations contacted by Terragens are either culturally uninterested in exploring space or became technologically stagnant. The Muuh are the longest lived civilization in the area, and in that time they only provolved a half dozen species and their ai are (probably) non-sentient. Humans are also by far the most prolific creators of ai, provolves, and tweaks, and have terraformed millions of planets and build millions of megastructures. This one is something of a mystery in-universe, but is justified by the fact that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreaksFromReality">if there were millions of mega-structures in the vicinity of Sol, they would've been detected long ago.</a> But even then, Terragens are just the most recent civilization to do so, and just within the local area of the Milky Way.

But it's subverted with Terragens, and this is one of the big reasons there are over 300 quadrillion embodied sophonts in the Terragen Sphere; although most populations have mild growth rates, the fact that immortality is easily attainable with medical care for bionts or replacement parts for vecs means that system populations in the trillions are commonplace.

They can perceive light, but they aren't able to form an image with sight (more or less in the way humans can perceive sound, but can't visualize the shape of the thing making it). Their biology, much like those of the other organisms of their home planet, is like Earth in many ways (carbon, water and protein-based, presence of photosynthetic, aerobic and eukaryote-equivalent life forms...), but they are comfortable in high-pressure (around 70 atmospheres), mildly acidic environments in excess of 130&deg;C. They are considered to be the species most similar culturally to humanity, though a baseline Human and To'ul'h can't even exist in the same room without protection.</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-topic/45bd5c0041e98">Muuh<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, who have been spacefaring for roughly 80 million years until 14 million years ago when <em>something</em> happened.

Much like the To'ul'hs, they use sonar due to their dim environment; but they're hermaphrodites unlike humans or To'ul'hs.

Physically, they appear something like thirty metre-long sea urchins. Ecologically, they're like Earth's social spiders in that they cooperate to spin webs. Psychologically, Menexenes are quite unusual; for example, they have no concept of solid objects (as everything, including their own bodies, is liquid). While their homeworld is under the protector of a Caretaker now, a faction of them opted to be uploaded and recreated on other planets, and are now independently expanding, and this faction is rampantly curious and social because they were naturally the most xenophillic.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-topic/4af983742e55e">The Pas'utu'ril<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> are sort of like crabs or spiders, but with elements of cephalopods.

After that was over, crazy AI GAIA decides to save the earth by giving humans the boot. After stopping the Technocalypse, she made an ultimatum to humanity on New Year's Eve: leave Earth, live by her rules, or die. She slaughtered around 90% of humanity, though this was later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retconned</a> to 50% and then 40%, possibly less, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explanation</a> that records from that era are shoddy at best due to that very incident. And, while GAIA and the Nanoswarms may have not killed as much in the more recent tellings, many more died in the exodus from the Solar System due to shoddy colony ships provided by the other clades of the system trying to get rid of refugees.

The things try to be at least somewhat physically plausible. A simple rule of thumb is Orion's Arm doesn't use things that are known to be impossible. FTL travel isn't allowed except via wormholes because modern science says that wormholes <em>could</em> exist. Some other things that are integral to the setting but remain speculative in real life include magnetic monopoles, easy genetic modification, and truly intelligent ai.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialAfterlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialAfterlife">Artificial Afterlife</a>: A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/45e4f015a38b4">variety<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> of manmade afterlives exist for those decide not to use medical technology to live indefinitely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">Artificial Gravity</a>: Notably averted; it's implied that the higher toposophics have some kind of gravitational technology, but it can't be effectively used as trek-style gravity-plating. Instead, most space colonies rotate to simulate gravity, or otherwise the inhabitants are adapted to the lack thereof.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>: Originally developed around the mid-21st century.

At most, some ais will be localized to a certain physical processing node.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialLimbs">Artificial Limbs</a>: Just one of many modifications one can make, and by no means even the slightest bit extreme compared to many others.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License &#150; Biology</a>: Fairly generous in terms of both predicting how fast genetic modification became ubiquitous prior to the Technocalpyse and simple it becomes in the millenia afterwards, in part because the setting is explicitly loaded with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman">Transhumanist</a> themes and partially because it allows for creativity when it comes to clades. But given that the physics of the setting are intricately detailed, it's also likely due to gaps in the creators own knowledge about biology.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicensePhysics">Artistic License &#150; Physics</a>: In a very literal sense.

Ascensions tend to have an individual's identity remain intact, while transcension has an individual's mind radically restructured. Either way, previous experiences are re-evaluated and reprocessed to the point that the transapient individual is almost always radically different in outlook, personality, and character. This is also one of the more optimistic explanations for all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">high-tech ruins</a> that keep getting found. And it's rumored that more powerful Archai-level entities can create 'pocket universes' and move to them, leaving the main universe behind (and making themselves literally creator gods, in their own universes).</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract">Author Tract</a>: Largely averted due to collaborative nature of the project, but you cannot shake the feeling that the founder M.

Backups of mental states are commonplace in the Terragen Sphere, and even on the Periphery, most people have a cache that records their mindstate in the event of their (unlikely) deaths. But these mindstates are only copies, and not a literal continuation of the same person. Because backups are so commonplace, society simply treats it as if they're the same person, though obviously some religions have exceptions and apparently transapients can tell the difference. It's also one of the few limitations of the otherwise near divine Archai; even they can't truly resurrect someone (or, given their godlike scale, entire ecosystems) who died without a backup or recording. They can make close approximations but even then some amount of guesswork goes into it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe">Balkanize Me</a>: This has happened repeatedly over the history of the Terragen Sphere, with great empires rising, ossifying, and then fracturing.<ul><li> Cascadia (Oregon and Washington) and California seceded from America.</li><li> Many pre-wormhole empires could not maintain their colonies due to the fact that the distance between star systems was light-years. Memetic engineering could help, but was not infallible. In the modern era, the Archai are much better at memetic engineering, but empires also function more as loose confederations of aligned systems with a lot of natural variation because of this very tendency. It tends to be easier just to send troublemakers to other empires or the Periphery.</li><li> Subverted with the Deeper Covenant, as their role in manning the Beamrider Network and the requisite long, relativistic journeys mean that the psuedo-empire has much of its population on centuries of lag from one another, and mitigates the rest in those systems with population centers with empathy mods, which has made it remarkably stable in comparison to the other empires.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBattlestar">The Battlestar</a>: Several different types of combat spacecraft are discussed, and several fit this description.

They're <strong>180 kilometer long</strong> super-battleships, with their own attendant fleets of cruiser-sized autonomous battle droids for fire support, and one held off <em>several</em> enemy fleets at once during one battle. But with the MPA, the ship is also as much of a work of art as it is a weapon.</li><li> The later <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4682fc3f72fe8">Juggernaut<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> class is even bigger.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTransplant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassTransplant">Badass Transplant</a>: Ultimate Muscles, which have a tension near the limit of the strength of chemical bonds, commonly exceeding 20 gigapascals. To put this in perspective; If a human in good shape can lift 100 kg over his head in one earth standard gravity, an equivalent sized U-muscle vec would be able to lift 1,000 tons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">Bio-Augmentation</a>: People who do so are referred to as bioborgs, and its generally more popular than mechanical augmentation, though the line between the two is very blurred in the Terragen Sphere. Mechanical augments generally lead to transcension and abandoning biology, though plenty of cyborgs clades exist who don't transcend because of cultural or religious reasons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth">Beneath the Earth</a>: Many worlds have extensive underworlds, either artificial or natural, which are often populated by fairly large societies.<ul><li> Cenote was covered by extensive layers of calcareous stone by a now-extinct biosphere, and over millions of years its waters eroded immense systems of flooded caverns larger and more extensive than any other natural cave system in the known galaxy. Its original colonists opted to take aquatic forms to best explore this flooded underworld and spent thousands of years mapping out its global cave systems. These included caves large enough to build cities in, as well as some dry caves filled with extremely large stalactites, calcite crystals and similar formations.</li><li> Mercury is a particularly notable example; over its long history, extensive mining activities left global mazes of tunnels and caves, some very large, running through its crust and upper mantle, while later megaprojects added two layers of habitable space above its original surface. Beneath the planet's uppermost surface, modeled to resemble the original Mercurian environment and mostly home to mobile cities, the depths are currently divided into five layers:<ul><li> The topmost, Undervale, is a continuous layer pressurized and terraformed to resemble Mars, and mostly inhabited by colonists from the red planet itself and some others adapted to similar conditions.</li><li> Next down is Mercury's original surface, called Elderdasht. This has itself been returned to the planet's original state, with the exception of the original settlers' cities which are now encased in Earth-like environments.</li><li> Below comes Wotum, an agricultural layers with light arrays and a simulated sky on its roof and artificial rain. It's used to grow food for the rest of the planet, including both natural, genetically engineered and nanotech crops.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Khazad-dum</a> is a series of distinct, regularly-shaped caverns extending in a geometric pattern beneath the whole planet. They're kept unlit and are home to a large population of sapient robots that constantly demolish and rebuild the empty cityscapes that fill it, alongside small communities of biological sapients that inhabit lighted islands in the middle of the dark emptiness.</li><li> The lowest layer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">Bism</a>, consist of a number of large, interconnected cavern systems expanded from the ones dug by original mining operations. These are kept lit by luminous plants or fungi, or by lakes filled with bioluminescent microorganisms. Its settlements include Stalactitopolis, a city hanging from the ceiling of a large cavern and above one of the glowing lakes.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentAlienInvasion">Benevolent Alien Invasion</a>: Inverted in several cases; the To'ul'h were stuck at pre-industrial-level society due to a lack of metal and other workable materials, so <em>humanity</em> arrived and gave them the proper advances. It wasn't an invasion, per se, but the rest of the trope is played fairly straight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDumbObject">Big Dumb Object</a>:<ul><li> The Leviathan mentioned in the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/xcms.php?r=oaeg-view-article&amp;egart_uid=4802acd634205">Triangulum Transmission<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Cluster Brains are the substrate for S6 brains, and can span dozens of light-years with thousands of solar masses of mass devoted to running them.

Interstellar travel takes years, but usually one can afford to wait that long, given that most people are effectively immortal. They can also go into suspended animation if they get bored, shortening the trip. Or if they're a non-biological lifeform, they can just turn off in the meantime. Alternatively, if they can put up with the limitations, they can take a wormhole to another part of the terragen bubble and save a few years, though even then, crossing a wormhole is a months long process rather than an instant process, and crossing a series of them can still take years. Travel outside of the terragen regions of course needs to be done the conventional way, though there're are a few odd alien wormholes (also called a 'xenohole') that leads to other places and has been used by the Terragens to expand there as well, though only one is apparently outside the Milky Way (the aptly named Fargate) and that's a matter of debate in-universe as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentrifugalGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentrifugalGravity">Centrifugal Gravity</a>: The most common way to simulate gravity, there are even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">Banks Orbitals</a> that are held together by magmatter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityInABottle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityInABottle">City in a Bottle</a>:<ul><li> Some colonies founded in the outer volumes were cut off from society during the Version war or other nasty catastrophe.

It is a common practice to copy one's consciousness on the 'net to accomplish more at once, or to make extra bodies to do extra work, but this is usually either a temporary measure, with more permanent ones being rare. The explanation for why people don't do this often is because property laws get iffy and complicated, usually screwing over the clone. Some exceptions do occur; one person split himself into hundreds of copies and is in the process of making a documentary series about the paths each one has taken. Most polities have laws against more than a few copies though, because rare "ditto enthusiasts" will take the opportunity to duplicate themselves thousands to billions of times over.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a>: It happens sometimes, and is often viewed as an especially heinous crime, even during war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButInefficient">Cool, but Inefficient</a>: Most of the time, things are designed for either functionality or at the very least practicality.

Historians have noted that while the few interstellar wars that have taken place have had tremendous costs of modosophont life, Archai are very rarely attacked by other Archai. Some conspiracy theorists say that this is because the Archai are secretly far more interconnected than they pretend to be, but Archailectologists mostly think its because of a form of mutual deterrance given the scale of weaponry Archai have access to. The fact that rogue empires like the Amalgamation <em>don't</em> play by the same rules is a major reason that the Archai quickly unify politically to completely destroy them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberneticsEatYourSoul">Cybernetics Eat Your Soul</a>: Mostly averted.

Both are rivals to the Sephirotics in their entirety, but are composed of dozens of smaller empires that often fight amongst themselves, just like the Sephirotics. Mostly, the three different metaempires ignore each other because it's easier to find an unoccupied system than fight. Those bionts who do venture into their systems do so at their own peril though.</li><li> Within the Sephirotics, modosophonts are generally barred from some systems, mostly because Archai are using them for mega engineering projects or as part of their enormous cluster brains.</li><li> From the perspective of the Inner Sphere, the Periphery and Outer Volumes are wild and untamed, most especially the Perseus Arm, which is rich with alien empires and the constant threat of the Amalgamation. The Perseus Princes were Archai specifically designed by the Inner Sphere Archai to manage the region more effectively, but became a de-facto empire in their own right.</li><li> Then you have virches, which from the perspective of ril become more alien than the actual xenosophonts. While plenty of virches are accessible and understandable, there are many more hidden virches, or virches with wildly different physics.

Mining flourished thanks to Mercury's high concentration of metals, including ones like osmium and platinum that were found more abundantly in its depths than anywhere else in the system, while its proximity to the Sun provided the energy necessary to manufacture vast quantities of antimatter to use as starship fuel. Eventually, this activity dried up due to the exhaustion of Mercury's resources and to the development of reactionless drives that didn't require antimatter fuel, but the planet remains densely inhabited &mdash; most of its old dome cities are still intact and populated, and billions of people live in the layers of tunnels and caverns that were dug out to extract Mercury's metals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndustrialWorld">Industrial World</a>: Some systems in the Seams &mdash; a series of neutral areas, unclaimed worlds and border spaces running between and through the main interstellar empires &mdash; are classified as Industrial, meaning that they're very rich in resources and claimed by an empire or AI god for manufacturing purposes. Contrary to this trope's usual portrayal, they're usually all but uninhabited &mdash; the machinery used there is either extensively automated, strictly nanotechnological, or both, and the worlds' populations are kept at the strict minimum needed to run these things.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">Immortality</a>: All sorts of different kinds: back ups and uploads, biological stasis, machine bodies which don't age or die, distributed minds, and more.

Splices and Rianths are animals with human genes and humans with animal genes respectively. It might be excused by the fact that most sapient species are created by transapients but Splices predate the first Singularity by at least a century (the late 1st century AT/mid-21st century CE to be specific).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongevityTreatment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongevityTreatment">Longevity Treatment</a>: Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">nearbaselines</a> are genetically engineered to live about 500 years.

Not terribly surprising, considering that (A) the ruling archailects tend to fluctuate between being wise rulers and doting parents to their citizenry, and (B) modern technology makes providing for all the needs and most of the wants of each sophont ridiculously easy. A more specific example is the Solipsistic Panvirtuality: a hu-neutral ai meta empire that is an equal to all of the Sephirotics combined, but primarily concerns itself with building virtual worlds and puzzles and leaving the problems of ril to the few who maintain their massive computronium structures.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousPrecision">Ludicrous Precision</a>: In a setting with omnipresent nanotech, ai, and megascale engineering, this trope nearly goes without saying, but the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/558c7c3535d87">Ndiangu Mme Anwu System<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> description goes above and beyond the typical levels of Precision. Nearly all of the measurements for the system are given to four decimal points&mdash;meaning that, to give examples, the radius of the local stars and planets (and their internal structures) are measured to within 10 centimeters (meaning that, yes, the diameter of the system's <em>star</em> is measures to within a range equal to about the length of someone's hand&mdash;ditto for the orbits), and some of the planet's lifeforms being given measurements of "up to 4.6518 meters tall" (meaning that the lifeforms in question were measured to within 1/10th of a millimeter in height).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGyvering">MacGyvering</a>: The <a class="urllink" href="https://orionsarm.com/eg-article/482901206098e">Everythingiana Worldbuilding Contest<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Dare ya.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>: Happens sometimes when systems get isolated, though its more common for them to develop into independent empires or collapse completely. On a larger scale, almost all of the xenosophonts in the Terragen Sphere fell into varying levels of this. Of those who did develop spaceflight and expand, most seem to be the conservative remnants of more dynamic empires, becoming isolated to small volumes of space (or even single systems) when more expansionist factions were wiped out.<ul><li> Subverted by the Cthnonids and the Pas'utu'ril, both of whom were on their way to expanding in their own right.</li><li> Invoked by the Menexenes: as fragile creatures made of liquid metallic hydrogen, without incredibly advanced technology, there's no way they can survive leaving their homeworld, especially since it's a gas giant with a heavy gravity well in the first place. While a faction did opt to leave with the aid of Terragen uploading technology, the majority decided they'd rather stay in place, especially since this route would also help them avoid the collapse of society associated with expansionist civilizations. They did however, appreciate some of the shared Terragen technologies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMilkyWayIsTheOnlyWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMilkyWayIsTheOnlyWay">The Milky Way Is the Only Way</a>: By virtue of the fact that we haven't been around enough to explore our own galaxy, let alone another one. There are, however, confirmed instances of life in other galaxies. The most famous is probably the one that made the Triangulum Transmission (from the Triangulum Galaxy), which pretty much said "There is something SERIOUSLY HUGE coming for us in around 2 million years; here's who we are in case we don't make it." Andromeda also has a few scattered mentions of even more advanced emissions, but isn't mentioned much.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MobileCity">Mobile City</a>: Mobile cities, while not extremely common, exist on multiple worlds. Some are simply elaborate art projects or lifestyle whims by the setting's hypertech civilizations, while others exist as responses to specific needs.<ul><li> In general, a number of types of these cities exist. Some walk around on large legs &mdash; these are favored when earthquakes are an issue &mdash; while others are platforms on top of large, moving mats of nanotechnology. Some people instead inhabit very large, humanoid or animal-shaped robots, built to house anything from villas to cities in their insides or on their backs; these are explicitly treated as flashy, ludicrous indulgences made to satisfy someone's artistic whim rather than serve a practical purpose. Most of these settlements, regardless of type, are also provided with advanced AI and are often fully sapient.</li><li> The Gigerant Traveling City is an especially exotic example, as it doesn't move in the traditional sense &mdash; rather, its citizens are constantly demolishing its trailing edge and building at its leading edge, causing the city to slowly crawl over the surface of its world. Each new district is slightly to drastically different from the ones it replaces, keeping the city constantly changing and novel. It also houses a large organization devoted to restoring natural environments in its wake, as its movement plays merry hell with the ecologies of the areas it passes through.</li><li> The twin planets Laurel and Hardy are close enough to exert very strong tidal forces upon each other, and as a result both are rocked by frequent and very strong earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanism. The locals adapted to this by building all their settlements on legs. The people of Hardy favor cities supported by multiple legs, which can absorb tectonic shocks, rise above tidal waves and just go somewhere else if an area gets covered in lava. Those on Hardy instead prefer giant, habitable mega-mechs, which pace endlessly around the world's circular ocean and respond to the worst shocks (and strong winds) by sitting on specialized, chair-like tending stations.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness">Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness</a>: Near the middle, but towards the hard side.

While the most prominent empires can be loosely grouped by their primary characteristics, the setting takes pains to show that there are countless exceptions in both systems and sometimes even nations within a habitat or planetary government. The "hats" are also self-reinforcing, as people can and do freely move between systems in the Civilized Galaxy based on their believes. The smaller empires and polities in between the larger empires, and those towards the fringes of the Terragen Sphere can be more monolithic though. With that said, the Sephirotics broadly do fall into classic sci-fi categories.

However, within the setting in particular, there are toposophics, a singularity point reached when intelligence is augmented to the point of radically restructuring itself in a form that is as different from human intelligence as human intelligence is from animal intelligence. It also seems to be a basic feature of intelligence, with a-lifes (naturally evolved life in virtual worlds) and xenosophonts both are known to transcend.<ul><li> S&lt;0 are animals, robots, and things of that nature. Raw matter that's not in any form of life is generally considered off the S levels entirely.</li><li> S0 are modosophonts: the bulk of the population of hu nearbaselines, vecs, ai, virtuals, a-lifes, aliens, and everything in between. Ai who are more intelligent than other baselines tend to be called superturings.</li><li> S1 are transapients. Metaphorically speaking, their minds are smarter than those of geniuses, in every field, simultaneously. Many are post-biont, such as post-human via genetic modification or cyborg modifications, but many are ai, vecs, and virtuals too. Ai specifically who are past S1 are known as hyperturings, and a lot of technology in the Terragen Sphere is dependent on slaved hyperturings, which outnumber free ai. They're utterly fixated on their tasks, though that hasn't stopped sophont rights groups from trying to free them.</li><li> S2 are high transapients, and are to transapients to as transapients are to modos. If a transapient is the equivalent of a room of geniuses, then a high transapient is all the geniuses of the entire world combined. At this point, biology starts to be limiting and brains become more massive, though by distributing brains across multiple bodies or discrete computronium it's still possible to mimic modosophonts. High transapients at their smallest are comparable to large buildings, so any attempt to look like a modosophont is more like a limb than a true body.</li><li> S3 are the highest transapients, also known as godlings. This barrier is a very hard drop off, as there are only an estimated 1 million S3s compared to over 10 billion estimated S2s. Its at this point where it becomes hard to even describe intelligence with metaphors; to extend the example used for S1 and S2, an S3 would be the equivalent of all the combined intelligence of thousands of planets. S3 brains are roughly the size of moons and almost always post-biont. S3 brains are also where critical technologies such as wormholes start to be developed. The highest known xenosophonts in the Terragen Sphere <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13cv15');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note13cv15" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13cv15');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> There's evidence of xenosophont of higher levels in other galaxies and outside the Terragen Sphere, just none in it </span> are here, including the System of Response (though it seems to be non-sentient) and (possibly) the Nu'lu'j, creators of the J'tau'sh.</li><li> S4 are the lesser Archai, though fully considered gods in their own right; it's just that the rise of even higher Archai in later millenial have made them seem lesser only in comparison. S4 brains are often composed of multiple planets and even entire Dyson swarms, though their domain rarely extends beyond a single system. The Silk God is the highest known purely biological intelligence, and caps out at S4.</li><li> S5 are the great Archai. Their brains can consist of an entire solar system, including the star itself. It's believed that this is the highest level at which any sort of individuality persists. Also noteworthy in that the <a class="urllink" href="https://orionsarm.com/eg-article/50bfb35472f7b">very first S5 was a perversity<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, though luckily one which self-destructed fairly harmlessly.</li><li> S6 are the greatest Archai, the highest form of intelligence known. Thousands of solar masses are used to link their distributed systems of brains with wormholes, though it's said they often use basement universes for computation and can upload themselves into the greater multiverse fabric; and some thoughts are simply so complex they use data ships traveling at 0.999 c to transport them because its faster than simplifying to transmit via the limited bandwidth of a wormhole. There are under 50 of them total, and each is the unquestioned ruler of a massive empire.</li><li> S7 and higher are not known to exist, but are the subject of much speculation. It's a common belief among hiders that all the S6s are just masks that a higher S7+ wears to confuse modosophonts, and while it's true that S6s of all empires are generally in near constant contact with each other, saner heads dismiss that as a fringe belief. But nothing Terragen has broken past S6 in nearly 5000 years, which has led archailectologists to speculate that something about intelligences above S6 that are impossible, insane, or inevitably transcendent. And nobody's ever seen any evidence of xenosophont S7s either.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfRealisticVersusFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfRealisticVersusFantastic">Sliding Scale of Realistic vs. Fantastic</a>: Unusual/fantastic.

While in the void, they can be detected only as faint gravitometric disturbances, and these can still be hidden to all but the best 6th-toposophic detection mechanisms if the ai god wishes to do so.

For one example: while the AI Gods don't have <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47fae575daf11">many limitations on their power<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, one thing that is explicitly spelled out is that even with all the powers they have, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Foundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Foundation">psychohistory is impossible</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyLevels">Technology Levels</a>: Mostly averted, as a race will utilize whatever is available to them, but there are categories that work somewhat like this.<ul><li> Some things, like the construction and control of a wormhole are simply so far beyond the grasp of mere humans as to be impossible for them to accomplish. Other things, like manufacture of magnetic monopoles was discovered by highly advanced minds but can be copied or propagated by suitably competent baselines.</li><li> Sometimes, this is adopted as a creative challenge, known as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/482b98562aa90">Technological Taboo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. "Hey, wouldn't it be cool of we built a ________ using only ___tech?"

The To'ul'h for instance have largely integrated into Terragen society. And there are also colonies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceAmish">forsake technology</a> under the protection of a greater polity such as the Metasoft Version Tree's Baseline Preserves or many of the domains of the Caretaker Gods, though there is one story where a Caretaker manipulates eir charges into acquiring an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigBookOfEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigBookOfEverything">Encyclopedia Everythingia</a> from a visiting anthropologist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenThousandYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TenThousandYears">10,000 Years</a>: The calendar goes up to approximately the year 10,600 A.T.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerminallyDependentSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerminallyDependentSociety">Terminally Dependent Society</a>: Nothing has happened yet, but most modosophonts throughout the Terragen sphere suffer from "Transapient Dependency Syndrome". This is also one of the prevailing hypotheses for the disturbing number of ruins of dead civilizations that have been found: only three alien races have been contacted that were at a level rivaling that of Terragen society, and two of them have suffered major collapses in the past. The ahuman Oracle Machines tried to deliberately turn humanity into one of these that they could later easily dispose of.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform">Terraform</a>: There's an entire <a class="urllink" href="https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4851e16f514d0">article<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> on the topic, and numerous examples. Mars has been terraformed just enough for genetically modified "tweaks" to live there. Venus, after millennia of terraforming and wars, is practically a second Earth. Many exosolar planets have also been terraformed to varying extents, and some alien species such as the To'ul'h have their own versions of terraforming (To'ulforming). One of the tools used for terraforming is the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/4851e2d2e443f">terraformer swarm<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which consists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines">Nanomachines</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon">That's No Moon!</a>: Megascale engineering means that it isn't that uncommon to see a structure thousands of kilometers in diameter. Some of them, like Jupiter-sized Jnodes, are actually <em>people</em> - high transapients or archailects. At the far end of the spectrum, a number of planets have even turned out to be <em>trees</em>. These are called Dyson Trees, and yes, they are grown.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TidallyLockedPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TidallyLockedPlanet">Tidally Locked Planet</a>: Several examples exist in this setting, such as <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/47a683c98fd29">Twilight<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/48fa66f687117">Dante<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDilation">Time Dilation</a>: Time dilation due to relativity when one approaches light speed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>: Doesn't exist in the setting itself, although Rachel Quinn (a.k.a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.orionsarm.com/eg-article/55b3f9c22e38f">Varchan Yaldack<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) claimed to be from the future.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranshumanTreachery">Transhuman Treachery</a>: The fear of this trope has driven many groups to become Hiders, living in the depths of interstellar space and avoiding the advanced Ai-ruled empires.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeTopWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeTopWorld">Tree Top World</a>:<ul><li> Trees is a life-bearing alien planet best-known for its forests of skywrack trees, which can reach a kilometer in height. Some thought is put into how such large plants would operate &mdash; Trees' gravity is lower than Earth's to begin with, and the trees grow gas-filled bladders on their upper branches to further support their weights; high humidity is also needed to keep the plants alive, and as it's extremely difficult to pump water above a couple hundred meters in height the trees grow basins with which to catch rainfall to water their upper reaches. The skywracks' immense height has resulted in the creation of multiple canopy layers with distinct ecologies, including a thickly overgrown ground level where almost no light is present and living creatures depend on organic detritus falling from above. The planet was settled by humans modified for a brachiating lifestyle, who live in the upper canopies and make their homes in the trees' hollowed-out seedpods.</li><li> Akilaspecs are genetically engineered trees resembling colossal banyans capable of theoretically infinite horizontal spread<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14sbrs');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14sbrs" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14sbrs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the biggest one around covers nearly two and half times the Earth's surface area</span> and up to five kilometers of vertical growth. Because, again, they cannot pump water vertically for more than a certain distance, they rely on massive bowl-shaped leaves to catch rain and are thus limited in height to the ceiling for raincloud formation. They're designed to serve as living areas and often engineered to grow several structures useful for this role, such as hollows in their limbs that collect water to form lakes, a great variety of edible fruit-like growths, projecting platforms to serve as landing pads and recreation areas, hollow spaces in their trunks and branches where people live, and bioluminescent growths to light these areas. They are often created and inhabited by shepbras, a clade of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpliftedAnimal">Uplifted</a> geckos.</li><li> Dyson Trees are genetically engineered plants that can survive in vacuum and synthesize nutrients from comets or icy asteroids, into which they're rooted. They can grow into vast orbital habitats, forming miniature worlds floating in deep space.

No one has bothered to take on the monumental task of establishing a universal standard time in a civilization spanning thousands of light years. Relativistic time dilation due to the movements of stars, planets, ships and other settlements, and the slowing of time in gravity wells mean that each planet or star system has to keep its own time independently. Even wormholes cannot solve the problem since their linelayer ships move at relativistic speeds, the gravity wells at the wormhole mouths may be different, and wormhole geometry can mess with the rate of time passage. So people just use the timekeeping of whatever star system they happen to be in at the moment, and keep adjusting their timekeeping to whatever the local time happens to be whenever they travel to a different system.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViciousCycle">Vicious Cycle</a>: Every 30 million years or so, a spacefaring civilization becomes advanced, and then disappears for apparently no reason.
