The show started with just Ricky and Stephen, but eventually, Karl was included into the show, since Ricky and Stephen realized from talking to him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Karl's bizarre worldview</a> was a source of humor they just <em>had</em> to exploit.

Ricky, Steve and the listeners all figured the answer was Boyzone, with the logic being that only boys were allowed in the area and not birds ("bird" being British slang for girl). A perfectly valid answer, but Karl's answer wasn't Boyzone, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBangles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBangles">The Bangles</a>, as in "ban gulls".

Ricky mocks one of Karls ridiculous ideas for solving the problem but when Karl asks what his idea is as a solution, Ricky's response is to fumble and quickly say that he doesn't know and doesn't want to pretend to know.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>: Starting with the second season of the cartoon, the animation started to gain more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">Kricfalusi-style</a> elements and become more expressive and lively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>: Even Ricky argues the show by this point is "<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Karl</a> says something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">MENTAL</a>".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License &#150; Biology</a>: Karl doesn't understand nature, and frequently speculates to fill in the gaps. For example: He was convinced that slugs eating postage stamps was a nationwide problem, and that slugs were sticky because they ate so much stamp glue that they sweated it from their pores when nervous.<ul><li> Karl <em>genuinely</em> believes that leaf insects evolved as a result of a beetle and a leaf "getting it on", and in the same conversation reveals that he thinks at some point a stick evolved into a stick insect.

He started as producer of the show and was not on the air at all, but Ricky and Stephen then started actually talking to him and realized he was <em>comedy gold</em>. He's become pretty much everyone's favorite participant in the show, which isn't surprising since Ricky can become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist</a> in a matter of seconds and Stephen often acts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>. It's reached the point where in the animated adaptation, only a few non-Karl bits (ie stories and such told exclusively by Ricky and/or Stephen with little or no interjection by Karl) have appeared.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">Asshole Victim</a>:<ul><li> It's hard to feel sorry for Steve when Karl offends him.</li><li> Karl finally beating Ricky on the lateral thinking puzzle is one of the most satisfying moments in the history of radio.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">Author Appeal</a>:<ul><li> Both of Karl's movie pitches revolve around someone having their brain (or part of their brain) transplanted into the body of another person.</li><li> Ricky is a self-professed fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> and makes frequent references to it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyDollBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyDollBaby">Baby-Doll Baby</a>: Karl Pilktington tells a story about a homeless lady who used to walk around town pushing a baby carriage.

The reasons he gives for this are: because he's been a reserved and docile person all his life; because everyone is doomed to die anyway; and because <em>there wouldn't be normal repercussions and it wouldn't matter anymore</em>. Ricky soberly calls him out on this. Karl, on the other hand, simply remarks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">he's always wanted to kick a duck up the arse.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BileFascination">Bile Fascination</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>: throughout the second season on XFM, Richard Anderson repeatedly tuned in solely to e-mail in comments such as, "What actually is the point of your show? Is it to confuse, irritate, depress, or what?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor">Biting-the-Hand Humor</a>: Back when the show was being broadcast on XFM, Ricky and Steve would make fun of the radio station and its listeners almost as much as they'd make fun of Karl and each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluffTheImpostor">Bluff the Impostor</a>: On the XFM show, they discussed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BritneySpears">Britney Spears</a> holding a concert at a small gay nightclub in London. However, to get tickets, the bouncers would "quiz" you to ensure you were a frequent patron. Steve and Ricky, of course, acted out this scenario.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluntMetaphorsTrauma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluntMetaphorsTrauma">Blunt Metaphors Trauma</a>: Karl rarely understands metaphors and often takes them literally. He thought the saying "People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones" was advising people not to throw things around inside their house because they might break something expensive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathlessNonSequitur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathlessNonSequitur">Breathless Non Sequitur</a>: Karl makes these constantly, but it's not so much him actually setting up jokes and more of a case of him kinda losing track of what he's talking about.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: On the 21st episode of the second season, shortly after Christmas, Steve recounts a visit to an HMV in which he signs a fan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUK">The Office</a> DVD. Since the fan works at the store, Steve asks, "Selling well, is it?" The fan says it is, but many people have been returning it as well. Later in the show, they receive an e-mail from their "number one fan," Richard Anderson, who, as usual, has a snarky comment. Ricky then notes the previous week had been the first week without an e-mail from him in a while. Much later in the show, Steve reads another e-mail from Richard, in which he explains he was unable to tune in the previous week because he was at HMV returning the copies of The Office he received for Christmas.<ul><li> In another episode, Ricky and Steve tell Karl two fairly detailed stories about crabs taking on information from ground up silicon chips and the baby of two bodybuilders forcing its way out of the womb. Karl is fairly impressed, until Ricky and Steve revealed they made up the stories to convince Karl he shouldn't believe everything he hears. A bit later in the broadcast, Ricky starts telling an anecdote about a card trick performed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown">Derren Brown</a> that ended with the chosen card being surgically removed during an appendectomy.<div class="indent"><strong>Karl:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">And then a crab went, "I know what it is!

He actually takes it in pretty good stride, though. Ricky and Stephen have even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">hung a lampshade on it</a> by comparing him, both physically and in attitude, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Peanuts">Charlie Brown</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a>:<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZb3JesBN7c">This Segment<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> In one Series 3 discussion about care nurses for disabled people helping said disabled person have sex - Ricky acts out a situation with two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> tetraplegic men asking Karl to help them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanNotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanNotSpitItOut">Cannot Spit It Out</a>: When Suzanne asks if he loves her, Karl replies "Yeah, you're all right."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellAJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellAJoke">Cannot Tell a Joke</a>: The biggest difference between Karl and Ricky and Stephen: Ricky and Stephen CAN tell a joke.

(or "I'm just sayin' that...") or "No, but what I mean is...", Ricky's "THINK, you idiot!"<ul><li> Gervais' exasperation has spawned a new one; "Don't. Talk. Shit."</li><li> Karl also uses the phrase "knocking about" a lot, even in situations where he is trying to make a serious point. Naturally this renders whatever he's saying hilarious.</li><li> Lampshaded by Steve at one point:<div class="indent"><strong>Steve:</strong> How many times have we heard Karl use the phrase "I'm just saying that..." followed by such a stream of nonsense that it's blown our minds?</div></li><li> Ricky cutting a conversation short with "Play a record." Once he went one better and told Karl to play <em>two</em> records, and another time he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackRetreatRetreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackRetreatRetreat">immediately changed his mind and ordered Karl to stop the record</a> so he could continue berating him.<div class="indent"><strong>Karl:</strong> <em>[about Derren Brown]</em> I was talking to people at work about him, and one lad said, apparently the trick that he uses is the same thing that Hitler did. <br><em>[beat]</em> <br><strong>Ricky:</strong> Play a record.<div class="indent">Then later, when Karl has been expounding on Derren's superhuman abilities:</div></div><div class="indent"><strong>Steve:</strong> But what are you claiming?

Hitler said that. Play a record.</div></li><li> When Ricky interrupts one of Karl's anecdotes or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">unorthodox lines of reasoning</a>, Steve will talk over him, exclaiming, "Let him finish!" As the series wears on, his patience shortens and will often deliver a rapid fire "shut up, shut up" as Ricky tries to continue his protests.</li><li> "Alrigh'." Karl's usual method of acknowledgement.</li><li> In the early Xfm shows, when Steve and Karl often rubbed each other up the wrong way, Karl would frequently shut Steve down without even trying, prompting Ricky to exclaim, "He's done you <em>again!</em>"</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityParadox">Celebrity Paradox</a>: Karl pitches an idea for a movie about a failed actor who gets his brain placed inside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomCruise">Tom Cruise</a>'s body. When Karl is asked who should portray the actor in his original body, Karl suggests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TedDanson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TedDanson">Ted Danson</a>. Stephen is quite perplexed about the concept of a universe where Tom Cruise is still a famous actor yet Ted Danson isn't.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentipedesDilemma">Centipede's Dilemma</a>: Many times Karl will be telling a story and Ricky and Stephen call him on the possibility of said scenario working. This leads to some very, VERY outlandish explanations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>: When Paul "The Party Animal" Parker was first mentioned in the cartoon, he was imagined as a schoolkid wearing bowling shoes and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> scarf who was asked to plan his school's parties.

While Karl is the butt of the show's jokes, Steve tends to be the butt of the world's. He believes that tallness should be considered a disability because of all the insults he gets and the expensive things he has to buy because of his tallness (like he can't fit into small cars, has to buy things from expensive Big And Tall stores). His story about Carnival in Rio is epic (basically, despite the reputation of Brazil's women as being sex fiends, he couldn't get a single woman to pay attention to him, and STILL can't), along with the story about how he was not allowed in a night club because he didn't bring any women with him.<ul><li> One woman said that she was "frightened" by a picture of him on a subway because he looked absolutely gargantuan compared to everyone else.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage">Childhood Brain Damage</a>: In the early Xfm shows, Karl once mentioned that as a child he fell off a horse and ended up being kicked in the head by it. Ricky and Steve can't resist saying that this could explain a lot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">Cloning Blues</a>: Karl believes this would be in effect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailedForDetails" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerailedForDetails">when asked a hypothetical question about having a doppelganger</a>.<div class="indent"><strong>Karl:</strong> How would I know which one I was?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckooland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckooland">Cloudcuckooland</a>: The Manchester estate where Karl grew up. So far, we've heard of "the lady whose mum was a witch", Shorts Man (who used short shorts to flash people), a woman who kept a horse in her house and had a son who chased cars, Jimmy the Hat (who never wore a hat), Scruffy Sandra (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>), a man who tattooed himself and accordingly had terrible tattoos on his dominant arm, and Karl's uncle Alf(red) who had a mattress in the back of his van but slept in a rubber dinghy. Among many others.<ul><li> There's also Miss Piggy - a spouse-abusing thief who tries to steal biscuits and, when accused, talks in a mirror, as well as 'Benny', a friend of Karl's father, who owned - <em>and 'thumped' </em>- a monkey.</li><li> Between this and Karl's claims of casual trips to seemingly anachronistic businesses (toffee shops, cobblers and fishmongers), Stephen has repeatedly asked if Karl actually lives in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">Narnia</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a>: Karl Pilkington. His grip on reality is openly questioned by Ricky and Stephen, but they wouldn't have him any other way.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckooLanderWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCuckooLanderWasRight">The Cuckoo Lander Was Right</a>: Sometimes Karl will say something utterly preposterous that is quickly dismissed by Ricky and Steve, but actually <em>is</em> telling the truth, such as his claim about <a class="urllink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/1509987/Stone-Age-tribe-kills-fishermen-who-strayed-on-to-island.html">modern cavemen living in the South Pacific<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> The general consensus on Karl (at least on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>) seems to be he's quite insightful and intelligent, but lacks the vocabulary to express what he means properly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicTrio">Comic Trio</a>: Ricky is the bossy one, Karl is the idiot (albeit more contrary than the classic model), and Steve is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">The Smart Guy</a> who tries to mediate but is constantly put down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious">The Comically Serious</a>: Karl delivers almost every single line in a flat monotone and appears to be permanently serious. This, of course, just makes his ramblings even funnier, as it gives the impression that he believes every single word he's saying, no matter how ludicrous. He does make jokes on rare occasion, which seems to delight Steve and Ricky.<ul><li> He also seldom laughs at the jokes the other two make - although given he's the butt of much of Ricky's material, that may be understandable. As such, it's genuinely surprising when he openly laughs at a line of Ricky's, to the point where Gervais seems openly pleased about it - see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a> entry down below.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">Comically Missing the Point</a>: Happens to Karl OH SO MUCH, due to his famous inability to understand metaphors. For example, while talking about idiomatic expressions, he said he didn't get "don't throw rocks if you live in a glass house", since he can't see why anyone would wreck their own house by throwing rocks from inside it. Ricky and Stephen were howling in laughter.<ul><li> Karl gets asked what would his superpower be if he could have any. The first things he questions is "But why have I been picked?" Stephen immediately goes "OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES!!" Then Karl says the reason he asks is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatResponsibility">it carries responsibility</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint">Touche</a>.</li><li> Then there's the time when Karl came up with the idea of a watch that tells you how much time you have left to live. Ricky asks him how such a watch would work. Karl's reply: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">Well you just put it on your wrist...</a>"</li><li> Ricky is telling Karl about a tree frog with enough poison in it to kill 1000 full-grown men. Karl being Karl takes this as meaning the frog in its lifetime will go out and <em>murder</em> 1000 people. They are never able to convince him otherwise, even when he mentions it in other podcasts.</li><li> Really, we could list half the podcast under this item, so it might be best to stop here.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/ComplainingAboutShowsYouDontLike">Complaining About Shows You Don't Like</a>: During the second season of the radio show, Richard Anderson regularly e-mailed the show solely to make fun of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Corpsing">Corpsing</a>: Karl had trouble getting through one Monkey News segment because Ricky kept making him laugh.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">Country Matters</a>: Ricky uses it a lot, as it doesn't really carry the same insult in the UK.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossDresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyCrossDresser">Creepy Cross Dresser</a>: One scene in "War Time" feature Karl's face on a woman's body and hair to match</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>: In discussing bodies of knowledge in connection with quiz shows, Karl suggests that there's snobbery about being an expert on something like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CoronationStreet">Coronation Street</a></em> and suggests a respectable "brainy" specialty would be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretentiousLatinMotto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretentiousLatinMotto">Latin Tattoos</a>"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CryingWolf">Crying Wolf</a>: Occasionally becomes a problem for Karl; he spends so much time talking about stuff which is obviously ludicrous nonsense that when he actually says something that has the element of truth to it (or is indeed just entirely accurate), Steve and Ricky are automatically primed to reject it out of hand. This isn't even as rare as you'd think.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerangedAnimation">Deranged Animation</a>: Occasionally devolves into this territory, such as the short sequence about Steve not appreciating Ricky's cat as it likes to "go for [his] ghoulies."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeSpam">Does Not Like Spam</a>: Ricky has it in for Turkey Twizzlers, every mention of them is to point out how only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatIdiot">Fat Idiots</a> eat them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DopeSlap">Dope Slap</a>: Karl is CONSTANTLY in the receiving end of the verbal version of these.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">Double Entendre</a>: Ricky and Stephen love making them, despite (or perhaps <em>because</em>) of how uncomfortable it makes Karl. This is doubly true, although more legitimate, on the older XFM (radio) shows, as Karl was afraid of the repercussions of Ricky or Steve swearing on-air. Of course, the one time XFM got a complaint and Ricky and Steve were meant to be reprimanded, Karl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">forgot to tell them</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>: Ricky and Steve are allowed to say <em>anything</em>, pretty much literally <em>anything</em>, in terms of insulting Karl and his overall lack of intelligence, appearance, and attitude, but the second he says anything about them, they will act like he's being ingrateful or biting the hand that feeds. Often justified due to the complete drivel that Karl comes out with, but sometimes, it does feel like Ricky in particular crosses a line.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake">Double Take</a>: Sometimes, the things Karl says will drive Ricky and Stephen to baffled, stupefied silence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a>: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB2Fc5ZJRds#t=99">During one show, Karl refers to Steve as an "invalid".<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> What follows is a long awkward silence. Then, Ricky quickly states that they had a request to play a song. It's one of the few times where Ricky doesn't have a snarky remark. You can hear Steve's bitter remark of "I...I don't want to do this right now" in the background while the music was playing. <span style="display:none">invoked</span><ul><li> Every so often, Karl's lack of political correctness about certain issues will prompt Ricky and Steve &mdash; themselves not exactly shy about playing with politically incorrect humour &mdash; to react in a "Whoa! Hold on there!" fashion.</li><li> Probably the best example is when Karl is talking when he went out with a girl who he later found out had a (supposedly) terminal illness. He broke up with her soon after because he didn't see the point in spending time and money on her when "she's going to die on me". Ricky literally screams "Oh God!" in disgust before calming down and saying, even though he understood what Karl meant, you still can't say something like that in public.</li><li> Another instance happened on the 46th episode of the second season. When they were discussing swearing, Karl says he thinks Jesus swore. When asked why he thinks this, one of the reasons he mentions is that having nails in your hands and feet has got to hurt. Ricky quickly attempts to change the subject and tells Karl he hopes he didn't offend any Christians.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>: During the monkey news segment about the bank robbery, the Monkey in questions turns up out of nowhere, disarms the robber, steals the cash and runs off with no explanation of where he came from or what he was planning. Still, he at the very least saved the customers from being killed by the gunman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisabilitySuperpower">Disability Superpower</a>: Karl considers Autism to be a superpower; he also thinks it's a far better disability to have than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadlyMythtaken">a "cyclop".</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DullSurprise">Dull Surprise</a>: In one podcast, Ricky reads Karl a fan letter telling him how awesome he is. Karl's reply is a flat "Cheers."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint">Dumbass Has a Point</a>: Occasionally, Karl does say something profound, even if he doesn't recognize it as such and was usually thinking of something a lot <em>less</em> profound (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithMonkeys">often involving a monkey</a>) at the time. Other times, Karl would actually tell stories or recite facts that either had actual factual basis or were even just plain correct, but would get shouted down by Ricky and Steve all the same.<ul><li> In a 2002 episode, when Karl presents a 'logic' puzzle to Ricky and Steve (nutshell: man turns on light before he goes to bed, why?). The answer is that he is a lighthouse keeper, with Ricky blasting him about the fact that the light is off at day and calling him a buffoon. When Steve (and hopefully ANYONE listening) realises that Karl is <em>right</em>, this leads him to cheer jubilantly on-air.</li><li> When talking about the "Russian Shop" with it's antiques Karl wonders why somebody in Russia who went off to live in seclusion in the forest on his own was canonized as a saint and commemorated when everybody else who stayed in the city and "put up with it" (ie: the stresses of the day-to-day grind) has been forgotten, and asks "Why has he got a plaque?". Why indeed?!<ul><li> Except in that instance, the story is related to us via Karl, who doesn't even tell us the saint's name or go into real specifics about earning sainthood.</li></ul></li><li> Ricky actively calls Karl out on several occasions for the question of "What are those things in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gremlins">Gremlins</a></em> called?", which naturally suggests that Karl is being a complete idiot for not being able to remember the name of the monsters who actively feature in the title. However, the creatures in Gremlins are, prior to turning into the more reptilian monsters, called 'Mogwai'.<ul><li> While Ricky admits later in the broadcast that he realizes Karl was thinking of Mogwai, it doesn't stop him from making fun of the question in future appearances.</li></ul></li><li> When discussing how to solve world hunger, rather than constantly giving them supplies, Karl suggest giving the impoverished the tools to become reliant.

One example is when he says that animals who interact with humans will learn certain behaviours from them to adapt to human society; while Ricky and Stephen dismiss it, it's not only true, but it's actually the very reason why domesticated house-pets exist.</li><li> Karl was once asked about what he would change about schools and how lessons are being taught, Karl managed to make Ricky agree with him by saying that teachers should ask open-ended questions in order to make students think of their own answers and interpretations.</li><li> An odd case in which Ricky was just as wrong as Karl; the latter believed Rasputin to be a creature that lived under a bridge, only for Ricky's girlfriend to point out he's thinking of Rapunzel. Ricky then corrects <em>her</em>, saying that Rapunzel was the story about guessing the antagonist's name...except that was Rumplestiltskin, not Rapunzel.</li><li> Karl's Educating Ricky's feature involved several enticing and intriguing headlines (usually based around a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">bad pun</a> like "What's Tomato With You?" or bizarre lunacy like "alien gives man a beard") that he said would get people interested and make them remember the facts better, which Ricky and Steve dismissed as nonsense. However, both were genuinely interested to find out what some of the headlines were about and usually managed to remember what they were about, proving Pilkington right.</li><li> Karl's opinion on gay marriage is to just let them get on with it because it's not harming anyone.</li><li> His views on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> blaming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaRap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangstaRap">Gangsta Rap</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSimulators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSimulators">Murder Simulators</a> for violence is that it's nonsense, because people have been killing each other for thousands of years.

In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnIdiotAbroad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AnIdiotAbroad">An Idiot Abroad</a>, the only sins he could come up with were reading the unforwarded mail of his flat's former tenant. He also took pride in saving flies from drowning in his pool so they could live another day, and felt sorry for a worm being eaten by a robin.<ul><li> Meanwhile, Ricky is clearly fairly clever and comes up with terms like "metabrain" (to describe a secondary brain that influences your primary brain, when Karl is discussing whether "you control your brain or your brain controls you"). And he's also a big jerk.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: The first editions of Karl's features were often quite different from their usual version.

Whenever they have her drawn for a story involving her, its always from behind, or her face obscured by an object, or in the fifth episode, completely enshrouded by darkness while standing in a lit doorway leading into a dark room, and later episodes just resorted to showing her with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindingBangs">Blinding Bangs</a>.

In the old XFM shows, Karl was more vibrant and laughed just as much, and as loud and clear, as the other two, but by the time of the podcasts that became the animated series, Karl almost always has a constant poker face, even then only breaking it when he gets frustrated. In a season 1 (2002) episode, Karl outsmarts Ricky with a riddle (see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint">Dumbass Has a Point</a> entry above), and celebrates by cheering and shouting at the top of his lungs - something fans who have only seen the series couldn't even <em>imagine</em> Karl doing. In the entire animated series, Karl only laughs once - to which Ricky and Steve are delighted - and it's only a quiet chuckle.

But special mention must go to the episode where Ricky and Steve discuss birds (the flying kind) that have knobs, and launch in to an entire segment (and indeed the whole episode) full of extremely blatant innuendo and swearing.

The latter part, at least, can possibly be justified through Karl's poor and inarticulate method of telling stories, which can often make it very difficult to tell what is fact, what is fact he's exaggerated and / or somehow distorted, and what's just completely made-up. Ricky even said that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking">Stephen Hawking</a> could be speaking to Karl and all that would come out of Karl was "gobbledygook".</li><li> In "The Ricky Gervais Guide To Philosophy", Karl expressed annoyance at Rene Descartes ("I think, therefore, I am") obviously having plenty of free time on his hands.

Stephen and Ricky pretend to be a couple asking if they can adopt; when Karl asks them what their jobs are Stephen says he's a rapist and Ricky responds "she" disposes of the bodies and that Stephen often does them in the wrong order.

Even worms. And then gets confused why they don't act the same way he would in various situations. Needless to say, this opens him up to a lot of jokes from Ricky and Steve about how these animals, while not possessing the kind of or level of intelligence that humans do, are still much smarter than him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterspeciesRomance">Interspecies Romance</a>: One of Karl's monkey news segments is a twisted take on the story of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_(chimpanzee)">Oliver the Chimpanzee<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, where a zookeeper takes pity on a lonely monkey and takes it home where it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestialityIsDepraved">seduces his wife.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicNickname">Ironic Nickname</a>: When discussing nicknames, Karl discusses the ones he remembered people had on the estate where he grew up.

In response, Ricky and Steve told him (off-air) that the Queen Mother used to swear profusely, citing a bunch of fake quotes riddled with 'F's and 'C's. At the beginning of the next week's show, Karl said on air that "the Queen Mum used to have a right mouth on her", and Ricky and Steve had to explain that they made it up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JacobMarleyApparel">Jacob Marley Apparel</a>: A trope that Karl happens to believe as <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft1B0Xxxx1o">fact for real ghosts<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JuryDuty">Jury Duty</a>: A question about Karl's hair (or lack thereof) leads to an anecdote of Karl performing jury duty. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Cue maniacal laughter by Ricky</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissOfLife">Kiss of Life</a>: Steve told a story about how a kid he knew thought he could resurrect a bird that had been hit by a car just by kissing it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a>: Karl often proves to be a particularly frustrating example of this for Ricky and Steve, as he will often misread something or only briefly skim it without fully digesting what it's saying (or &mdash; frequently &mdash; just make something up entirely) and then use this half-understanding to come up with a flawed and inaccurate impression of what's going on. And then will <em>refuse</em> to accept that he's wrong about it. Conversations will frequently have examples of Karl stating an inaccurate or clearly misunderstood point, Ricky or Steve correcting him, a brief pause, and then Karl saying "No, but..." and continuing on as if they hadn't spoken.<ul><li> For example, he saw a blurb in the paper about <a class="urllink" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/03/0328_060328_fly_glasses.html">a fly with glasses<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. He assumed that the fly was near-sighted and they were correcting his vision. This prompted a tirade from him about why humans are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">"saving everything"</a>. After laughing, Ricky has to explain to him that it's an art piece to show how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">awesome lasers are</a> and that they didn't prescribe corrective lenses for a fly. They try to ask him how they would even test for near-sightedness in a fly and Karl replies, "Well, he'd be bumping into stuff". Cue maniacal laughter.</li><li> He even outright admits his tendency to skip over or wildly misremember information from news stories. While summarizing an average day in his house, he describes Suzanne pointing out that a news story about "worms with teeth" was something completely different.</li><li> Ricky finally summarizes the problem as that Karl is only willing to pay attention or retain information if he thinks its interesting, not if it's true. Since the reality of something is often more mundane than the conclusions he draws, Karl tends to just ignore any attempt to correct him and persists in his misinterpretations.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LackOfEmpathy">Lack of Empathy</a>: Karl seems to have a mild version of this; he's certainly not sociopathic by any means (he can be fairly sympathetic to others, including bugs drowning in his pool and worms), but he seems completely unable to put himself in the shoes of the person (or animal, as the case may be) that he's discussing, to the inevitable end that he's completely unable to understand why they just don't do what he'd do in that situation (such as, for example, why people in famine and poverty-stricken nations don't just move somewhere else). This tends to lead to some of his failures of logic.<ul><li> The aforementioned girlfriend with a terminal illness incident comes to mind, as he didn't see the point in spending time with someone who he thought was going to die soon. He was more worried about "wasting" his money and free time than he was giving someone who's presumably not in a happy stage in their life some comfort.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LamarckWasRight">Lamarck Was Right</a>: Karl's apparent understanding of evolution.

The answers to his "cryptic" clues were often not the actual band name, but a pun that sounds vaguely like the band name, with the clue often requiring the listeners to really stretch their imagination to make it sound like the band name. Naturally, some of these made Ricky furious.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>: Ricky is a master of this trope when it comes to Karl's insane ramblings, which becomes particularly prominent over time during Karl's Monkey News. Ricky frequently foresees the incoming twist &mdash; granted, something which is not exactly hard given that it nearly always involves something previously suspected to be a human turning out to be a monkey &mdash; and repeatedly points out how ridiculous certain events would have to be to reach that conclusion in the hopes of making him see how absolutely unbelievable his stories are.

He occasionally brags to Ricky and Steve about his exceptionally high pain tolerance, as assessed by a single masseuse at a spa day. Given his constant moaning and the experiences listed under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience">Near-Death Experience</a>, they don't buy it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">Malaproper</a>: Karl does these frequently.

Ricky and Steve then point out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHourWorkWeek">this is all he has to do</a> and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithPeople">he doesn't even like his family</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">or enjoy spending time with them</a> anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy">Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy</a>: Played with.

Not that he does much to defend himself, but you can tell he gets flustered when the subject comes up and will try to drop it as quickly as he can. Any time Karl mentions meeting an attractive male or a gay person, Ricky and Stephen will NOT let it go.<ul><li> "<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

He also got sidetracked comparing the covers of gay and straight men's porno mags while hunting for a UFO magazine.</li><li> Karl has, on multiple occasions, admitted that his eyes are immediately drawn to another man's genitals if they're out and about, such as in a locker room. Even if women's genitals are also exposed, such as during the party stripping incident, when he immediately looked at the men instead.</li><li> Karl seems rather preoccupied with gay men's sexual habits, such as pondering what the previous owner of his apartment (who happened to be homosexual) was doing in front of his mirrored wall or if gay men would be admitted to try out a sex machine advertised for women.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonkeysOnATypewriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonkeysOnATypewriter">Monkeys on a Typewriter</a>: At one point in season 1, Karl refuses to believe that they can actually write anything.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a>: Season 3 opens with arguably the best episode the show's ever done, but shortly after the episode aired, Karl passed a kidney stone. The second episode is significantly more somber, but it does get better as they go on.<ul><li> Karl's hilarious stories involving his brother tend to end with him mentioning him being in prison or not having seen him in years. As Ricky put it:<div class="indent"> "Karl's stories always start out nice and funny, and then they just leave me empty and slightly depressed."</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger">Mood-Swinger</a>: Steve and Ricky especially can wildly veer between helpless laughter and frothing rage as a result of Karl's anecdotes and personality.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">Moon Logic Puzzle</a>: "Rockbusters" in Season 2 was an attempt to puzzle through Karl's unique logic to identify musicians by initials.

Upon being pressed, Karl admits that this was a "good year" for her. Ricky and Steve would routinely criticize Karl's "gifts" to Suzanne, since they were often gifts that he would also somehow benefit from, such as the condoms, or dinner/holidays that she would pay half for.<ul><li> Poor gift-giving is a bit of a theme of the show. Karl blames his traditional lack of effort on the childhood experience of buying his mother (who's "into gnomes") a Victoria Plum figurine that she hated, and on the year he got a computer without enough memory to play any games, which caused him to throw up out of sheer anguish. He also claims that his Auntie Nora once gave him a t-shirt with her face on it, which is why he doesn't believe in the idea that when buying a gift, you should buy something a person wouldn't buy for themselves. Ricky is revealed to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenienceStoreGiftShopping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenienceStoreGiftShopping">bought his entire family scratch cards for Christmas</a> and recalls the year he realized he was too old to just wrap things he'd found around the house to give to his older siblings. And the main attribute of Steve's father of which we're aware is his lack of gift-buying sensitivity: his birthday gifts to the adolescent Steve included "The Making of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Thriller</a></em>" and the collected wartime speeches of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a> ("Never forget, son"), and for his twentieth wedding anniversary, he passed over Steve's suggestion of a makeover/spa day and dinner for his wife in favor of a stainless-steel trowel ("Do you think I should've got it engraved?") and an industrial-size tin of coffee. Years later, Steve mentions that his father finally got his mother an appropriate Christmas gift &mdash; a gold bracelet &mdash; and then spent the entire day bragging to people about it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearDeathExperience">Near-Death Experience</a>: In the third season of podcasts, Karl tends to act as if the surgery to remove his kidney stones was one of these. Ricky tends to disagree and be less-than-impressed with his complaining on the subject as a result.<ul><li> They once dedicated an entire segment of the radio show to Karl's stories about his "near-death experiences" as a kid. The first involved choking on a Mr. Freeze pop (which he credits with giving him a sense of a new lease on life, as a result of which he went to school for three whole days in a row); the second was a snowy day when his mother didn't think it was safe to go out, so he had to sneak out to do his paper route in time to get back and watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPanther1963" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePinkPanther1963">The Pink Panther (1963)</a></em>, and he got caught in an upstairs window and almost fell; and the third was during the martial-arts craze in the eighties when he tried to "kick his height," but froze at the apex of the kick to try to get his father's attention, lost his balance and hit his head on the ground. There was also the story about the time he ate too many cream cakes and had a bad stomachache. His mother called the doctor, who sarcastically said he didn't have long to live, which his mother believed until Karl's dad came home and phoned the doctor to check. Ricky tactfully suggests that in another family, they might have realized the doctor was joking.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">No Celebrities Were Harmed</a>: In the animated "World Cup" episode, Karl is shown comforting an ersatz-David Beckham.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAnswer">Non-Answer</a>: When Karl is explaining his first film pitch.<div class="indent"><strong>Karl:</strong> Why is that so weird when, that's what they do now.

Ricky calls this out as a pointless nickname, since most people don't wear hats.<ul><li> The 'Guide to the World Cup' begins with Karl trying to 'calm his gums down' and immediately degenerates into discussions about liver transplants, musical instruments being used in battle, Steve pretending to be Peter Crouch, Ricky using his talking iPad app, and Karl talking about getting done for swearing by his P.E. teacher. Needless to say the World Cup tournament barely gets a mention.</li><li> The name of the show itself. Ricky Gervais might be the host, but Karl is the main attraction, and both Ricky and Steve know this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotGoodWithPeople">Not Good with People</a>: Karl seems far more comfortable around bugs (or ghosts!) then friends or family.

Karl was rude with him and told him "That doesn't matter, you're here to do the kitchen." Ricky and Steve chastise Karl for this, since he was probably just asking about it for when his lunch break comes. They then point out that Karl has a radio in his kitchen that's tuned to XFM and that they might know it's him. Karl looks frightened and Ricky and Steve encourage the builder to steal from Karl and trash the place.</li><li> Karl once insulted Suzanne's haircut on air, saying she looked like Dave Hill from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Slade">Slade</a>. The following week, he talked about how she heard that and was upset, but then said she won't be listening this week and that they could chat about her fat ass.

He kept this up until one day, while attempting it, the worker asked him, "...are you Stephen Merchant?" He had momentarily forgotten he'd been on national television and become recognizable on the street, but rather than admit what he'd done, Steve carried on the now far less plausible lie.

For instance, one of Ricky's accusations was that Steve preferred getting cheap sandwiches for lunch rather than going to a restaurant, to which Steve retorted that you only <em>need</em> a sandwich or something similar for lunch, and that Ricky just tended to overindulge when eating out. On another occasion, Karl accused Steve of being tight-fisted after Steve made a big deal about Karl not paying him back 50p that he was owed, which prompted Steve to point out that the <em>actual</em> problem was that Karl arbitrarily decided that he wasn't going to pay Steve back because it was such a small amount of money rather than letting Steve actually make the choice to waive the debt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldianConversation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeinfeldianConversation">Seinfeldian Conversation</a>: The main format of the show, it's just Ricky, Stephen and Karl musing about life in general, commenting on news stories or telling funny anecdotes. The intro to the show is, "For the past few years, Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, and Karl Pilkington have met on a regular basis for a series of pointless conversations. This is one of them".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a>: Steve finds his Rio adventure every bit as funny as the audience does.

Point A. I seem to distinctly remember talking to one of my mates the whole night and we were discussing the fact that we were too shy to talk to girls. So <em>wrong there</em>.</div><ul><li> Steve and Ricky (although primarily the former) often make fun of the show itself. For example, when they were accused of creating Karl as a character and scripting the show, Steve's response was essentially "If I wrote <em>this</em> show, I'd be ashamed."<ul><li> Even Karl made fun of the show's quality. In XFM series 2 episode 9, Ricky mentions that Karl was the only one coming up with new features and how he's the main reason people listen, so it might as well be called the Karl Pilkington Show. Cue Karl's response:</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Karl:</strong> I don't want my name to this.

In the UK, "scampi" refers to a very singular type of small lobster which is typically prepared very similar to shrimp, and often is substituted with shrimp. Given that they were having "scampi and chips", it's likely they were lightly fried in butter as an afternoon snack.</li><li> Ricky bemoans the awful state of reality TV by mentioning shows where people say, "look me fanny fell off!" In America, "fanny" means "butt", whereas in Britain, it means... rather more than just the butt. The animators drew the former scenario.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>: People are regularly compared to characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> for quick reference. Paul "The Party Animal" Parker is immediately assumed by Ricky to look like Milhouse, Karl describes a fellow hospital patient as Mr. Burns and Stephen believes Karl dressed as a clown would look like Krusty, among others.<ul><li> While serving on a jury, the image of Karl being drawn by a newspaper illustrator (since photos of juries are not allowed) makes Steve think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Charlie Brown</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackedByTheAnalogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidetrackedByTheAnalogy">Sidetracked by the Analogy</a>: Karl; for instance, he doesn't understand the "thousand monkeys on a thousand typewriters" probability theorem, because he imagines it's about monkeys <em>trying</em> to reproduce the works of Shakespeare and is convinced they would make mistakes.<ul><li> Don't get Karl started on people living in glass houses.</li><li> Karl doesn't understand analogies at all. When outright asked for the definition of "analogy," he responded "A short story, told quickly."

Steve is amused at the idea that someone is so full of outrage and hostility to the system and The Man that they feel the need to protest basic safety advice.<div class="indent"><strong>Steve:</strong> Fuck looking both ways before I cross the street!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">The Social Darwinist</a>: Karl seems to have this sort of mindset, such as when he describes his Auntie Nora as "a weak person" who's been "allowed" to live longer than she should have.<ul><li> This extends to his attitude towards zoology; he is convinced that were are too concerned with conservation, and believes animals must be "useful" to justify their existence. Not useful to an ecosystem, mind you, useful to <em>him</em>. Part of this seems to stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of "survival of the fittest".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomeOfMyBestFriendsAreX">Some of My Best Friends Are X</a>: When Ricky questions if Karl's "Cheeky Freak of the Week" feature is in poor taste, Karl says it can't be since he works with Steve.

The most he changes facial expression is raised eyebrows. He practically always has the same pouty facial expression.<ul><li> It was a huge deal to Ricky that he actually made Karl laugh in a conversation animated for the television episode "Munchies". Ricky kept interrupting Karl, and finally Karl said, "You have to keep it-" "Erect!" and Karl finally gave in and started laughing as loud as the other two. Ricky even pointed out to the audience, "I made Karl LAUGH!"</li><li> He also laughed when Ricky accused him over the phone of not actually meeting gorillas like he said and just having the director in a monkey suit.</li><li> And Karl chuckled mildly when Monkey News included a chimp called 'Eighty Six', and Karl then introduced a Suede song as "One of Eighty-Sixes' favourites".</li><li> He can also become visibly annoyed when not allowed to make his point. One notable example is when he gets sick of Ricky and Steve making fun of his "problem hole" analogy to the extent that he folds his arms and pouts.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks">Stupid Crooks</a>: Ricky is scammed out of a quarter-million pounds by a fraudulent bank transfer for purchasing gold.

This can lead to arguments between Ricky and Steve, with Steve usually coming to Karl's defense and yelling at Ricky to shut up and let him finish when Ricky tries to shout Karl down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">Take Our Word for It</a>: Karl's descriptions of Suzanne is the prime example, especially as she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnseen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnseen">The Unseen</a> to everybody (she wishes for her face not to be in the public domain and the fansites are respecting that wish).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenReligiousTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenReligiousTeammate">Token Religious Teammate</a>: Karl counts as a downplayed version of this.

Karl once unwittingly touched a nerve with Steve regarding this. Steve was asking how Karl had met Suzanne as a friendly gesture. Somehow, Karl got offended and poked fun at Steve's status as a single guy. This prompted Steve to make a sarcastic remark on how he didn't want to be reminded of his loneliness on a comedy radio show.
