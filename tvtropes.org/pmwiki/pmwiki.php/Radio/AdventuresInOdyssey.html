Except that it promotes Christian values and Biblical messages. Oh, and it's a radio show.</p><p><em>Adventures in Odyssey</em> (1987-present) is set in the fictional town of Odyssey (in an unnamed State, but likely the Midwestern USA&mdash;the original version of the show, Family Portraits, identifies it as being in Ohio). The centerpiece of the town is the kids' discovery emporium and ice cream shop, Whit's End, run by John Avery Whittaker ("Whit"), who acts as a wise old grandfather to every kid who walks through the door. Whit is a devoted Christian, the rich owner of an encyclopedia company, former consultant for the National Security Agency, and a somewhat wacky inventor. Most of his inventions are permanent starring attractions in Whit's End. The most famous (and frequently used as a plot device) is the Imagination Station &mdash; in simplest terms, a virtual reality time machine. Whit's End is also home to a fair number of mysterious rooms such as: the secret hidden room in the attic that held clues to a treasure hunt, the secret hidden room in the basement where a murder occurred, and Whit's secret computer room with wall-to-wall TV screens and the master computer that runs every invention in the shop &mdash; and talks.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Some of the most recurring characters are the employees at Whit's End. Over the years, this has included: rebellious teen-turned-convert Connie Kendall; super-techno-genius Eugene Meltsner; his distant cousin and professional window-washer, Bernard Walton; Eugene's wife, a substitute teacher named Katrina; part-time spy and Whit's son Jason; and Whit's friend and local antique dealer, Jack Allen. The show has also had various casts of kids of varying eras. The first included chronic troublemaker Curt Stevens; budding journalist Lucy Cunningham-Schultz; sisters Robin and Melanie Jacobs; all-American siblings Donna and Jimmy Barclay, the boy and a girl of the Barclay's eventual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABoyAGirlAndABabyFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ABoyAGirlAndABabyFamily">A Boy, a Girl, and a Baby Family</a> set-up. The next era included young writer and resident sweetheart Mandy Straussberg, her brother David, and her best friend Liz Horton; cousins Alex Jefferson and Cal Jordan; another rebellious teen-turned-convert, Aubrey Shepherd; Jared DeWhite and his younger brother Trent; Marvin and Tamika Washington; and Grady McKay. The most recent era (dubbed "the relaunch" by fans) includes the Parker siblings, Olivia, Matthew, and Camilla; junior detective Emily Jones and her older brother Barrett; Barrett's rival Jay Smouse; reformed troublemaker Buck Oliver; and Connie's half-sister Jules.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Aside from the individual half-hour segments, the show has featured three major long-running, (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster">more mature</a>) arcs. The first dealt with the plots of Dr. Regis Blackgaard to take over Whit's End as part of a larger goal that slowly came to light over its course. (Whit was, unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">away on a secret archaeological expedition</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterOutlivesActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterOutlivesActor">in the Middle East</a> during the finale.) The second arc dealt with a plot by the communications company Novacom and a computer program they created, in which Eugene was a major, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">if completely absent</a>, player. A shorter but sequential 12-part serial "The Green Ring Conspiracy", concerning a counterfeit ring, has been also been released, notable again for its level of maturity in storytelling. Finally, the third major saga concerned a student at Odyssey Middle School named Morrie Rydell who was more than meets the eye and seemed to have more sinister intentions as the saga went on.</p><p>The series is created by the American Christian advocacy group Focus on the Family and is the flagship program of FOTF Radio Theater. It currently airs on numerous radio stations in the US and Canada, and is available in compact disc and cassette albums. Episodes are also rotated daily for free listening on the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.whitsend.org/">official website<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, about five at a time. A Spanish version, titled <em>Aventuras en Odisea</em>, has been in production since 2013. An Animated Adaption airs on some Christian broadcasting stations.</p><p>Now has an in-progress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AdventuresInOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AdventuresInOdyssey">Recap</a> page.

Unfortunately, Lisa ends up being found with the two-way radio at the worst place at the worst time (right after an important test at school; resulting in her being accused of cheating) and ends up unwittingly taking the fall for the entire scheme, getting in trouble at school and with her parents.

John Avery Whittaker becomes Juan Carlos Castillo; Connie Kendall is now Connie Campos (and moves from Mexico City rather than from California); the Barclay family becomes the Vargas family; Eugene Meltsner is now Eugenio Mendez; and so on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>:<ul><li> Earlier episodes were typically a bit more relaxed and low-key. It's best explained as being like a more traditional slice of life show, before future albums had more fantastic elements kick in such as the Imagination Station and the more intense story arcs. In addition, Connie was absent until a few episodes into the main series, Eugene wasn't around until 1988, and Jason and Wooton weren't introduced until <em>much</em> later, which can be a bit of an adjustment if you're used to the more frequently heard episodes.</li><li> Also, early episodes feature many kids who were quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> as more characters were developed and other kids, like Lucy Cunningham-Schultz, the Barclays, Rodney Rathbone, and Robyn Jacobs, emerged as stronger personalities. Some of those early kids have very familiar voices: Azure Janosky (Donna) and David Griffin (Jimmy) voiced several minor characters before the Barclays were upgraded to major-character status, and Shirley Ziegler was voiced by Sage Bolte, who would go on to play Robyn.</li><li> Tom Riley is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a> in early appearances, rather than the folksy, down-home farmer he'd shortly become.</li><li> Chris had a larger role earlier on as the show's host. Most episodes would have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening">Cold Opening</a> where she would go through some sort of skit to set the stage for the episode's topic. The skits became more and more elaborate to the point that the producers felt they started distracting and taking away from the main focus of the show, leading to her role getting vastly reduced beginning with "Dobson Comes to Town" onward to only summing up the episode's moral at the end (with even her "we'll be right back" segues into commercials being dropped off along with it). Needless to say, if you started the show somewhere in the middle and go back to the early ones, it can be strange hearing her participating in actual skits and being treated as a citizen of town.</li><li> In a different sense, album releases used to be one-to-one copies of the original broadcast versions of episodes, with the reading of the address, the phone number, and a brief outline of the next episode intact. Later on, album releases would cut most of this out from the closing.<ul><li> Similarly, the reading of the phone number was relegated to the show's closing instead of a commercial break. The address also used to be different before Focus on the Family moved to Colorado (Ponoma, CA 91799 instead of Colorado Springs, CO 80995). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnTheNext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnTheNext">On the Next</a> element was also dropped entirely after some time, and the "ask for today's episode" emphasized the fact that the cassette was free, which changed after the show became a Christian household name. Finally, Chris addressed herself by her full name at the time (Chris Lansdowne) rather than just "Chris". Most of this has been alleviated on reruns, though you can still hear it in their original ways on the older audio cassette releases.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasyEvangelism">Easy Evangelism</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Zig-Zagged</a>. In some cases, 5 minutes and a commercial break is all that's required to get a conversion. In other cases, especially those involving main characters, it can take years after they're introduced before they convert, and some simply don't for whatever reason. And you can be sure that recurring characters still have lessons to learn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricTownsfolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EccentricTownsfolk">Eccentric Townsfolk</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectionDayEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectionDayEpisode">Election Day Episode</a>: "By Any Other Name" and "It Takes Integrity" for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>; "Tom for Mayer, Parts 1 and 2" and "The One About Trust, Parts 1 and 2" for the mayorship of Odyssey.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorFailure">Elevator Failure</a>: In "Real Time", Whit and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockJock">Cryin' Bryan Dern</a> find themselves trapped in an elevator in the middle of a bomb threat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">Embarrassing Nickname</a>: Jellyfish, a small-time hood in the Blackgaard saga.

A notable example is "The Other Woman", where the Rathbones seek to discredit Tom Riley as Tom considers whether he should run for mayor again. Dolores and Rodney accomplish this by taking a photo of Tom sitting at a mental institution with an unidentified woman who did not appear to be his wife in an attempt to get Tom caught up in a scandal. When Bart realizes that all their scheme did was bring unwanted attention to Tom's personal life and his mentally ill wife Agnes (who turned out to be the woman Tom was with in the photo after all; she had just dyed her hair), however, he does not celebrate that the incident ultimately caused Tom to not run for mayor again and is instead genuinely mortified by what their scheme ultimately resulted in.

The standard instead is "beyond a <em>reasonable</em> doubt".</li><li> Leading off from that (though this is more of a hole in the dialogue itself), the defense attorney's case rests on exposing all of Novacom's misdeeds to the public to give Tom a motivation for the destruction of the tower under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsanityDefense">Insanity Defense</a>, then tells Tom that "the jury will never convict you". But the jury <em>would</em> be convicting him; that's the whole point of pleading guilty under insanity. They just might not give him a particularly harsh sentence under the circumstances. It's also not really a proper insanity plea; for one thing, there should have been reference to an actual psychiatrist on the witness stand. Simply showing the jury evidence indicating Novacom's culpability for circumstances leading up to the hypothetical situation that Tom really did blow up the tower won't be enough for an actual insanity defense.
