As the psychotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">heel</a> Jon Moxley, he has participated in multiple indie promotions, perhaps most prominently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>'s former farm league Heartland Wrestling Association, Insanity Pro Wrestling, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CZW">CZW</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate">Dragon Gate</a> USA.</p><p>He signed a developmental contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2011, and was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental promotion, with the new ring name Dean Ambrose. The next year, he debuted on WWE's main roster alongside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> as part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Heel">villainous</a> stable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> at that year's <em>Survivor Series</em>. The group&mdash;Ambrose included&mdash;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">turned face</a> in March 2014, only for Rollins to betray and attack them that June. Outraged by his teammate's treachery, Ambrose began a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">deeply personal</a> feud with his former Shield partner. During his tenure there, he became a one-time United States Champion, with his 351-day reign being the third-longest in history and the longest within WWE (who acquired the title in 2001), a three-time Intercontinental Champion, the 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a> winner, a one-time WWE Champion, and a two-time Raw Tag Team Champion (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>). He is the youngest Grand Slam Champion at 31 years 8 months old, edging out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">The Miz</a> by <em>one month</em>!</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Ambrose would depart WWE in April 2019 following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a>, making him the most sought-after free agent in wrestling until signing a deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">All Elite Wrestling</a> the next month. He made his AEW debut under his pre-WWE ring name Jon Moxley at the company's inaugural event <em>Double or Nothing</em>, laying waste to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a>. Shortly thereafter, he made his first NJPW appearance a memorable one, winning the IWGP US Championship in his first match with the promotion. Moxley's AEW contract allows him to work international and indy shows that don't conflict with AEW.</p><p>At AEW's <em>Revolution</em>, Moxley defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> to become AEW World Champion.</p><p>As usual, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> has more <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Moxley">information<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about his career.</p><p></p><hr><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><h2>Mox Tropes:</h2><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In General&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">All Girls Want Bad Boys</a>: Despite being a face, he fits the archetypal "bad boy" role well enough, and it no doubt played a large in his popularity with the female demographic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">Ambiguous Disorder</a>: There's <em>something</em> wrong with him, but precisely what that something is might be impossible to discern. Aside from being violent and angry, which could be attributed to his traumatic childhood, he also exhibits paranoia, hears "voices" occasionally, and swings wildly between despair and begging his opponents to "put him out of his misery" to being a ranting near-psychotic with a God complex. Perhaps the closest diagnosis would be Borderline personality disorder, but he doesn't fit well into any diagnostic criteria.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: Probably the stand-out example in wrestling for the 2010's. A <em>self-aware</em> anti-hero on top of that. He's called <em>himself</em> a "scumbag" in face promos, and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a> of the highest order. Take away all of that, and he <em>still</em> wouldn't be a straight hero because he's not sane enough. And yes, he's self-aware about that too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>: Either as Jon Moxley on the indies or as Dean Ambrose on FCW/WWE.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBoast">Badass Boast</a> : Watch any Moxley's or Ambrose's, chances are, either he will deliver deliver oone of these or just make an <em>entire</em> segment out of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>: Fits this either as Ambrose or Moxley, but is much more open about it as the latter. Especially after leaving WWE, where he's picking fights with people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinoruSuzuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MinoruSuzuki">Minoru Suzuki</a> and Lance Archer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">The Bus Came Back</a>: He made a surprise cameo in a March 2020 episode of <em>WWE Backstage</em> when he crashes his wife Renee Young doing a video call to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BookerT">Booker T</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/XavierWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/XavierWoods">Xavier Woods</a>. This marks his first appearance in WWE television since his departure in April the previous year.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo">The Cameo</a>: He makes one in a March 2020 episode of <em>WWE Backstage</em> by appearing in Renee Young's screen due to him chasing their pet dog.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>: Brought up by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WyattFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WyattFamily">Bray Wyatt</a> during their first feud in WWE.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0oudf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0oudf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0oudf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> According to him Ambrose's father's been in jail since Ambrose was a kid. He also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">implied his mother drowned herself.</a> </span> Also mentioned funnily enough by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LukeHarper">Brodie Lee</a> upon their first confrontation in AEW.<div class="indent"> <strong>Brodie Lee:</strong> I don't know what you are. Or if you're just a scared little fatherless boy from Cincinnati!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustPunchOutCthulhu">Did You Just Punch Out Cthulhu?</a>: In his WWE days, he made Bray Wyatt suffered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> and made Brock Lesnar staggered with a low blow. He also gave Minoru Suzuki <em>two</em> deathriders, before eventually <strong>defeating</strong> him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>: In his early WWE career, he used a headlock driver called Dirty Deeds, later changed to a snap double arm DDT. In his first match as Moxley post-WWE, he debuted an even more brutal lifting version of the Dirty Deeds called the Death Rider. He also uses both Dirty Deeds and Death Rider interchangeably in AEW... both under the same new name, being called the Paradigm Shift.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>: Can be seen as this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> if you think about it. Both were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">hugely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopularityPower">popular</a> during their peak times in WWE only to be bogged down by bad booking and exhausting schedules eventually causing them to leave the company. With Punk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">walking out</a> after one bad creative decision too many and Moxley/Ambrose leaving once his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">contract ran out</a>. And both went on podcasts after they left the company to discuss their grievances publicly. But the difference between them is Punk let his experience taint his overall love for wrestling and hasn't step foot in a ring since. Mox/Ambrose made it clear his greivances were mostly creative and that he still loved wrestling and debuted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllEliteWrestling">new company</a> not 2 months later and continues wrestling. Even going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> and competing in the G1 Climax that same year which is more grueling than the usual WWE schedule.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GutturalGrowler">Guttural Growler</a>: Just about every instance where he has the chance to talk he's this speaking in a very scratchy, raspy way. In both WWE and especially in AEW take the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xFaEkZaWkA">first promo<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> he cut for the company as an example. Probably best illustrated when he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting">cutting a promo</a> in the ring. He's usually always screaming roughly into the mic about something.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a>: The one thing that's consistent about his erratic personality is that he's liable to snap at a moment's notice.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>: In 2017 to Renee Young.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>: Despite his passion for wrestling, Moxley had shown that he is a great actor, having played both a hero and a villain in seperate movies, and got praised in both of them for his acting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Jack-of-All-Stats</a>: He has neutral strength, speed and resistance but, for better or worse, doesn't stick out as extraordinary in any one area... unless you're counting bat-shit insanity as a stat.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDegreeOfSeparation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDegreeOfSeparation">One Degree of Separation</a>: He, as Jon Moxley, and Seth, as Tyler Black, have wrestled and/or tagged with a <em>lot</em> of the same people. Perhaps their strongest connection is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JimmyJacobs">Jimmy Jacobs</a>, who Mox had a major feud with that ended in a "I Quit" match, and who Black used to be best friends with in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestlingSocietyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestlingSocietyX">Wrestling Society X</a> and the Age of the Fall up until their relationship degenerated. In spite of all that, and although Good and Lopez had probably met prior before, the two hadn't wrestled each other or worked together until they met up in FCW. There, they soon found out they were "wrestling soulmates".

There was so much tension between Ambrose and Reigns that just about any other team/stable in WWE history would have long since imploded on itself &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">it seemed painfully obvious</a> that WWE's creative team was setting up a team-wide split (possibly to turn Roman Reigns face and give him a push). Seth Rollins, being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulative</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">chessmaster</a> that he is, gave the two something to confront as one when he walked out on them, then used the situation to convince them to put aside their issues, resulting in The Shield becoming stronger than ever and making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.<ul><li> Sadly, after making it perfectly clear that The Shield were Evolution's superiors, Rollins stabbed Reigns and Ambrose in the back and would go on to claim that the brotherhood he presented the Shield as was just a lie that they believed in; to him they were nothing but business partners. However, once again the two responded only by banding closer together, and while they may have decided to split up and operate on their own, they still remain brothers and are after the same targets.</li><li> Years after the breakup, Rollins turned face, and, having regretted his actions, tried to make amends with Ambrose. Ambrose was not receptive to the idea at first, but on some level he still saw Rollins as this, enough that he started to flip-flop over it. On Rollins' part, he was sincere in his efforts and desperate enough to win Ambrose's forgiveness that he was willing to take a steel chair to the back for it, which Ambrose ultimately couldn't go through with. After that, the reconciliation was inevitable. While Ambrose himself snapped from all the angst and issues he'd dealt with in WWE and turned on Rollins a year later, this time it took only a few months for him to come back to the fold one more time before leaving the company with The Shield's brotherhood intact.</li><li> Speaking of leaving WWE, if Jon Moxley's interview on Chris Jericho's podcast is any indication, this friendship goes beyond the screen and beyond the three men's ties to the company. While he'd already made the decision to leave and wrestle elsewhere months ago, the moment that sealed that decision for good was when Vince tricked him into disrespecting Reigns' then-ongoing second bout with leukemia for heel heat one week after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> against Rollins, then tried to tell him to do it again but much worse the next week, which he refused. While Rollins and Reigns, or more to the point, Colby and Joe, both pleaded a few times with him to reconsider his departure, Jon was able to confirm that things were still good with them, as they understood why he did what he did, having been there with him and seen much of what troubled him with Vince's creative process.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a>: He fits this to a T.

The man grew up in low-income housing and was even homeless a few times. His mother worked as a prostitute&mdash;who was frequently abused by her clients&mdash;to put food on the table, while his father is in prison. He was forced to sell drugs in high school, had his baby cousin- actually his sister; he doesn't tend to mention her, for privacy- taken away from him by child protective services, and dropped out of high school at age sixteen to attend Les Thatcher's wrestling school. A wrestling school he couldn't legally attend until he was <em>eighteen,</em> so he paid his dues by cleaning up the building all by himself every night while observing the workers in the ring and practicing his promos to himself&mdash;a talent that ended up making him famous.

However, he's just <em>way</em> too over with the fans to really be a proper tweener. His first major feud in the company was a brutal one with the 100% face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a> based around Moxley simply wanting to make a name for himself by destroying the biggest target he could find, but the fans cheered for him just as much as (if not more than) Omega.

Its pretty clear that Moxley's main goal is to topple AEW's golden boy and to make an immediate name for himself. In response, Omega chatised Moxley for his insanity as well as his tenure at WWE especially in the last few months. A match between them was initially scheduled at <em>All-Out</em> but was postphoned due to Moxley suffering from MRSA staph infection. At <em>Full Gear</em>, the two fought in a brutal unsanctioned Lights Out match with Moxley coming out the victor.</li><li> Aside from Kenny Omega, Moxley also attacked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a> on his debut. Once Moxley's feud with Omega has ended, he set his sights on Jericho and the two even brought up their 2016 feud while they were in WWE.

For a while, the mere sight of Rollins would drive Ambrose into a blind fury. As the months passed, though, he learned to control and harness some of that anger, probably so much so that Rollins didn't think Ambrose was a serious threat to him anymore (especially after Bray Wyatt interjected himself into Ambrose's sight). When Rollins spent half a year in rehab for his injured knee, his first thought was to come back, go after Reigns, and recapture the title he never lost. He did; and it was only in that moment, when Rollins had achieved a goal he'd been going after for months, that Ambrose, fresh off a Money in the Bank briefcase win, cashed in for the title and pulled it all out from under him.

On the February 22, 2016 edition of <em>Raw</em>, Ambrose showed that he might have the biggest pair in the company.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">god of violent retribution</a>, perhaps feeling the slightest tinge of mercy, simply stepped on Ambrose's head and over his body towards the ramp, only to turn back when Ambrose told him to <em><strong>kiss his ass</strong></em> and challenged to a No Holds Barred Street Fight at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em>.

From the perspective of his once-brothers, he was the team's heart in their reunion run, as it was his continued solidarity with Reigns and his forgiveness of Rollins that brought the team back together. When he fell to injury in 2017, they defended him from insults by both ally and foe alike, and refused to accept any replacements. For his part, if his <em>WWE Chronicle</em> edition is any indication, he believes that Seth never cared to check on him during a time in which he was dealing with a potentially life-threatening medical issue related to his shoulder injury, until such a time as he knew Dean would be back and ready to go so he could call him back to action.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8bijr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note8bijr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8bijr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To hear Rollins' perspective, he did try to call Ambrose over his recovery time but Dean never answered the phone.</span> Weeks after his turn he claimed that he once believed The Shield made him strong, but now came to see backing up Rollins and Reigns as a burden holding him back, and also accuses the three of them of having been "rotten to the core" behind the scenes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>: If something bad is going to happen to a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>, more often than not it's going to happen to him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a>: Him and Seth Rollins were this for nearly the entire time they worked in the same company.

Dean picked it up from the ground, placing it on Roman's shoulder and said, "Don't worry. I'll take it on Sunday". Flash forward a year later prior to Triple-Threat Match at Battleground between him (current WWE champion), Reigns and Rollins, Ambrose confronts Reigns at a Live Event as the latter is holding the championship belt before he tossed it back to him, silently emulating the same words he was told.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>: Ambrose has grown significantly from his debut. Initially he started out as the hotheaded <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">Wild Card</a> member of The Shield who frequently went overboard with beatdowns against the Shield&#146;s enemies and showed hints of being the one to turn against his teammates. Becoming jealous of Reigns and fueled by revenge towards Rollins. But overtime and on his own after The Shield&#146;s dissolution he learned that that behavior doesn&#146;t often lead to him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityHasAdvantages">winning matches</a>. And he grew into a more collected and trusting person able to depart the company and parting ways with Rollins&#146; and Reign&#146;s as friends.<p></p><ul><li> Never was this more apparent than his storyline between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> in 2017 where he ended up learning to forgive his former teammate. When Rollins sold out The Shield in 2014 Ambrose became obsessed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">getting revenge against</a> Seth for what he did never missing an opportunity to beat the hell out of him. But by 2017 he&#146;d mellowed out significantly getting his revenge against Rollins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyintheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyintheBank">by winning the WWE Championship from him</a> and finding his own way after getting drafted to Smackdown.

Rollins even going as far as offering to take a steel chair to the back just as Seth had done to him all those years ago and Ambrose declined. Something that never would have happened 3 years ago.<p></p></li><li> Also reflected in his relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> though more understated. During the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">Shield</a> run around 2013 and going into early 2014 Ambrose started to become insecure due to Reign&#146;s standout performances. Being the sole survivor for one example at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SurvivorSeries">Survivor Series 2013</a>.

But their relationship changed when Rollins&#146; turning against them instead of severing their bond it strengthened it and they became closer no longer under the pressure of competing against each other and at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble 2015</a> one year later in the final four against Big Show and Kane with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadbuttofLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadbuttofLove">Headbutt of Love</a> Ambrose fought together with Reigns not even attempting to toss Reigns out. Their relationship remained strong all throughout Ambrose&#146;s tenure in WWE and they continued to trust each other completely, never feuding. He&#146;s come a long way from the guy everyone thought would be the first one to turn on The Shield.</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a>: And not in the heroic "defensive" sort of way, either. Irritate him enough (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">doesn't take much</a>) and he will willingly go outside of the rules to cause you as much pain as possible. He's lost a match or two by DQ by going to town on people with chairs at random.<ul><li> Other than that, Ambrose's gameplan during a given match seems to be "run full speed at anyone not on my side and hit him repeatedly." As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnBradshawLayfield">JBL</a> constantly mentions regarding his standing elbow drop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveTheHighGround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHaveTheHighGround">from the top rope</a>, Ambrose doesn't care if what he does is a traditional wrestling move or not, as long as it hurts his opponent.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a>: Seems to be a character point with Ambrose. While his other former Shield brethren had pretty clearly defined functions and styles in the ring (Seth as the high-flying technician and Roman being the muscle), Ambrose is a lot more random, and it shows up in his ring psychology. Unlike other well-promoted faces, he doesn't seem to have a standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveMovesOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveMovesOfDoom">Five Moves of Doom</a>. His hard-hitting Pendulum Clothesline is set up by a rebound off the ropes, which probably happens about twenty times in your standard wrestling match. His "Dirty Deeds" Double Arm DDT doesn't seem to have a tell until he actually locks the arms. It's often said on match commentary that opponents don't know what Ambrose is going to do next primarily because <em>Ambrose himself</em> doesn't know what he's going to do next.<ul><li> Extends to his high-flying moves as well. While the suicide dive can be hit from out of nowhere, it's also equally as possible that he'll go for the dive, stop before he hits the ropes, and then plancha his opponent instead. Or do a turnbuckle-assisted elbow drop. Or simply roll out of the ring and simply punch his opponent in the face faster than his opponent can counter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolLoser">Cool Loser</a>: Ambrose is no doubt one of the more entertaining, charismatic superstars on the roster and has put on some hard-hitting, entertaining matches with the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett">Wade Barrett</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrayWyatt">Bray Wyatt</a>... but he didn't win a single PPV match or come out on top of a feud in between the Shield dissolved in June 2014 (or, if you count his time as a singles competitor in The Shield, since <em>Night of Champions 2013</em>, where he beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KofiKingston">Kofi Kingston</a> to retain his United States Championship) until <em>Extreme Rules 2015</em> in April 2015, where he defeated Luke Harper in a Chicago Street Fight. Granted, a few of those PPV losses have been due to being screwed at the end somehow. Only Wyatt really ended their feud clean. Finally, officially, subverted at <em>TLC: Tables, Ladders, and Chairs 2015</em> when he won the Intercontinental Championship from one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen">Kevin Owens</a>, his first championship since he held the United States Championship while still in the Shield.

Ambrose, in his face incarnation, can sometimes give even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mankind</a> a run for his money in the "More pride/guts than brains" department.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>: As part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> personality, it's become apparent that he has an absurdly high pain threshold and a refusal to stay down while he's still conscious. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>'s three-man squad cornered him in a boiler room, it took them several minutes to beat him down, and it was only after a Chokeslam from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> <em>and</em> a Curb Stomp from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> that Ambrose finally lost consciousness.

After Ambrose retained by pushing Owens off the turnbuckle and into two stables stacked on top of each other, both men proceeded to pull double duty and enter the Rumble later that night. Ambrose entered two-thirds of the way through and made it to the final two, outlasting several major stars such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheWyattFamily">The Wyatt Family</a>, and even his best friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>.

This was mostly due to the fact that he was selling a shoulder injury from the week after Rollins betrayed the Shield all the way through the night Rollins curb-stomped him out of comission for a month. That shoulder injury was pretty much the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfHadTheFlu">only reason</a> Ambrose would ever lose to Rollins, who was by that point a cowardly heel who never hesitated to run a way from a fair fight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyRespect">Dude, Where's My Respect?</a>: In the weeks leading up to his Heel turn on October 2018, Dean complained that since the Shield reformation, its always been about Rollins and Reigns.

Regarding this, Ambrose has said that he's watched so much wrestling in his life, from everywhere and from every time period, that more often than not, he has no realization that he's seemingly channeling any one wrestler. So he's gotten comparisons to, besides the aforementioned Pillman and Piper, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TerryFunk">Terry Funk</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JakeRoberts">Jake Roberts</a>... it's an almost endless list because of his natural charisma, intense promos, and eclectic in-ring style.

Ambrose also uses a double arm DDT as his finisher just like Foley did, and in the March 14, 2016 episode of <em>Raw</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeUpMySword">was gifted the trademark</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatterUp">barbed-wire-covered bat</a> that Foley used during his heyday for his match against Brock Lesnar at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 32</em>.

It became clear early on that it wasn't because he didn't want to &mdash; on the contrary, more than once it was implied that it was the one thing he wanted to do, more than anything else. It was because Dean was scared of doing so and being betrayed again, causing him to lash out when Seth tried to make amends. On Seth's end, he completely understood Dean's anger and refusal and was willing to take his verbal and even physical abuse, but it didn't stop him from being frustrated about it, especially since Dean wasn't innocent either (though admittedly more justified). Eventually, both realized that in order for to reconcile, Seth had to forgive Dean as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>: On the last <em>Raw</em> before <em>Money in the Bank 2016</em>, Ambrose holds an <em>Ambrose Asylum</em> segment with his former partners <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> on their upcoming championship match. Near the end Ambrose interjects that since he's part of the Money in the Bank match at the PPV also, he could win the contract and cash in his opportunity that same night on whoever wins between Rollins and Reigns. He proceeds to do exactly that and win his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship.<ul><li> In one of his last WWE promos before the Shield's match at <em>Fastlane 2019</em>, Ambrose said "Eight years ago I walked into this casino and now I'm cashing in my chips and I'm walking away from the table." After leaving WWE, he would make his return to the wrestling scene when he showed at the end of AEW's casino-themed <em>Double or Nothing</em> PPV, with his debut climaxing in him fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KennyOmega">Kenny Omega</a> up to the top of a stack of giant poker chips that decorated the set and hurling Omega off.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a>:<ul><li> Making it a point that Rollins will not cash in his Money in the Bank briefcase.<div class="indent"> <strong>Ambrose:</strong> Every time you ever think about cashing in that contract, I&#146;m gonna be there.

It&#146;s loaded with TNT, and every time you try to cash it in, it&#146;s gonna blow up in your face, Seth. Believe that.</div></li><li> How right did he turn out to be? Rollins had to wait until WM 31, when Ambrose was completely debilitated and damaged in the IC Title Ladder match, before he could think to cash in his MITB contract in the main event.</li><li> Historically in wrestling, there are two ways to guarantee one's calculated plan will fail: if it gets leaked on camera in advance or if it's a repeat of something they've already done. Furthermore, the Money in the Bank ladder match takes quite a toll on every competitor involved&#151;there's a reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a>'s the only one who ever cashed in MITB the same night he won it. So naturally, on the go-home <em>Raw</em> to <em>Money in the Bank 2016</em>, Dean Ambrose, the same guy who's either come up short or got screwed countless times in world title situations, attempts at revenge on Seth Rollins, and competitions against Roman Reigns alike, took it upon himself to host <em>The Ambrose Asylum</em> with Reigns and Rollins as his guests and outright tell them that he would win the MITB ladder match and then cash in on the winner of their title fight that same night to walk out the WWE World Heavyweight Champion. On its face it looked like Ambrose had just screwed himself into coming up short in the title picture yet again, either by painting a target on his back by slighting the physical stake of the ladder match or by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe">openly scooping the champ in on his move in advance</a> and giving them time to prepare for it.

Out of Kayfabe, Ambrose is the <em>only</em> member of the group to <em>not</em> have scandal attached to his name. Rollins got caught having an affair behind his fiancee's back when she posted NSFW images of him and his lover on social media, and has been plagued with injuries to his opponents during his title reign, culminating in he himself getting injured to end said title reign. The aforementioned lover also got fired six months after their affair was revealed for something completely unrelated to the incident &mdash; someone dug out Neo Nazi artwork that was posted on her Twitter and Instagram, and it reflected <em>badly</em> on Seth, who was still dating her at the time. Reigns has had his controversial mega-push where he was clearly projected to be the next face of the company, despite the ardent and vocal resistance of fans all across the country, and then his suspension for a wellness policy violation.

However, he was right about one thing. As Dean put it so delicately to Dolph, even if Ziggler did win and become the world champion, it doesn't mean his problems will magically disappear overnight and his life will become complete. On the contrary, his life as a world champion will become even more stressful as pressures will mount for him to carry the company on his back. Not only that, but wrestlers, management, and even fans themselves will watch him like vultures and just wait for him to slip up and fall. Basically, even if Dolph does win, his critics, doubters, and personal demons will still be there but as world champion, he has an even bigger target on his back for all the doubters and naysayers. Pretty much, Ambrose gave Dolph the straight scoop and told him that he'd better have "ice water running through [his] veins" if he wanted to be world champion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>: On the March 3, 2016 episode of <em>SmackDown</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen">Kevin Owens</a> tried to jump Ambrose from behind while Ambrose was facing the ramp.

It has easier and faster setup and execution (in and out of kayfabe) and is more damaging (kayfabe-wise) than the original headlock driver version (In reality, it is because 1) nobody in the current roster uses the double underhook DDT and 2) the original Dirty Deeds greatly resembles Adam Rose's Party Foul and Ambrose probably decided that he should be the one who must change his own finisher).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">Motive Decay</a>: His 2018-2019 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> suffered this in short order as WWE could not commit to a reason for his turn.

But don't think for a second that the man isn't smart. In the build-up to the 2014 MITB, Ambrose used his established loose-cannon status to secure a place in the match. When he got the news that Seth Rollins literally begged that he be put in the match, Ambrose's initial reaction was to laugh and say "I knew he would." In short, Ambrose played him like a fiddle. Who's the chess-master, again?</li><li> Taking advantage of Cena's tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">take on</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">all comers</a> by causing the rest of the Authority to get involved in his and Cena's No-DQ Contract-on-a-Pole match for Hell In A Cell against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>. Cena predictably started trading blows with Rollins, Orton, and Kane. Meanwhile, Ambrose snuck around behind the action and by the time Cena had cleared the ring, Ambrose already had the contract in hand.</li><li> He did this for <em>Money in the Bank 2016</em>. Starting with the go-home show, he just made the most idiotic mistake you could make with a master plan in wrestling by blatantly announcing the plan to its intended victims, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>, in front of the whole world before even getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">the pieces in place</a> (which in itself would be a doozy of a task).

This spurs him to issue an open challenge to the locker room later that night. Cue chanting and hip-hop beat... yep.

The truth of the matter is, Ambrose was pretty much the only male singles face that was completely over with the audience by the end of 2015, especially since the injury bug went nuts around that time and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> had been a non-factor for most of the year. Reigns, who the company <em>desperately</em> wanted to get over as the next top face even though the fans made it blatantly clear that they wanted Ambrose if Bryan was no longer an option, was partnered up with him as a result. Not that it didn't make sense, thanks to the Shield and all, but it didn't make the fans any less resentful, and the Intercontinental Championship was an attempt to compromise. Further complicating the issue is the fact that the man Ambrose eventually took the title from was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KevinSteen">Kevin Owens</a>, who was popular himself. Many considered this to be a blessing in hindsight, since Ambrose and Owens proceeded to have a critically-acclaimed feud that many fans stated was the most interesting thing on WWE programming for its duration.</li><li> When Ambrose finally won the WWE Championship, the crowd absolutely <em><strong>exploded</strong></em>, and the following night they were hot for him, chanting his name and "YOU DESERVE IT!", and hanging on to every word of his championship promo. A lot of people have remarked that Ambrose's reign is refreshing, since he's arguably the first true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">face</a> champion since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a>. Everyone who has held the title since Bryan was forced to vacate it were either heels (Rollins, Lesnar, Sheamus, Triple H) that had issues getting heel heat from the crowd,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11rnee');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11rnee" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11rnee');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Rollins is majorly popular with the hardcore crowd, Lesnar has transcended traditional face/heel dynamics, very few people cared about Sheamus, regarding him as irrelevant, and Hunter's usually successful mega-heel antics fell flat and instead gave him face-like heat thanks to a combination of nostalgia, NXT, and the face he was feuding with</span> or faces (Cena, Reigns) that were from divisive to universally disliked.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12m2gu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12m2gu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12m2gu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">while people have warmed up to Cena in recent years the base is still split over him holding the title again, while Reigns was on the fast track to becoming the most hated wrestler in modern-day WWE thanks to his terrible mega-push until he was temporarily sidelined by a recurrence of leukemia in 2018</span> Ambrose is the first champion in a while to get a reaction that isn't disingenuous.</li><li> Ambrose was so popular that every time he teased a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> in 2018, the fans <em>cheered</em> for him. WWE was only able to successfully turn him on the <em>one</em> night that the fans would've never accepted it: the night Roman Reigns was forced to vacate the Universal Championship and take a hiatus from WWE due to his leukemia returning. It was the night that him and Seth Rollins needed each other more than ever, the night they won the <em>Tag Team Championships</em> together in Reigns' name, the night that <em>everyone</em>, from the fans to Ambrose and Rollins themselves, needed a feel-good moment to end on. Hell, it was the night that finally managed to band the world behind Reigns. Instead, the fans watched <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> implode for a second time, and this time, not from an unexpected, calculated betrayal, but from one that had building for a long time, and had boiled over in a extreme fit of emotion. And even then, people sympathized with Ambrose even though they hated what he did, as they understand on some level why it happened.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">Power Stable</a>: In much less flattering role, The Shield were brought under Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in WWE and made to protect Randy Orton.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a>, Rollins being the high flier and the strategist, Reigns being the muscle and Ambrose being the unpredictable brawler and talker.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F-Strike</a>: <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/SWLU0MWMR-w?t=47">When Seth Rollins turned his back on The Shield<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, you can see Dean Ambrose mouth what appears to be "The fuck...?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a>: Would you believe Dean Ambrose believes himself to be on the side of justice?

Even years before it finally happened, the fans knew that, one way or another, Ambrose was going to turn heel. It was the most logical direction of his character; Ambrose was never the most stable of individuals to begin with, and with the endless number of misfortunes he's had to endure since the Shield broke up (not least of which was one of his two closest friends betraying him and his other friend), he was going to snap one day.

This is especially apparent during their feud over the FCW 15 title, which is defended in fifteen minute iron man matches. They went the first two matches without falls, and the second match had five-minute overtime. Even their third match, which was thirty minutes, ended in a draw with two falls a piece, forcing them to go into sudden death overtime, which isn't really much of a victory for either man. That series of matches is considered to be among the best in the history of FCW prior to its repackaging as NXT, and really highlights their inability to have a bad match against each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: In his early WWE appearance (<img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Except that "lunatic fringe" refers to a <em>metaphorical</em> place on the outside of society and/or a gathering ground for people who are (at the very least) eccentric. It's not an actual <em>person</em>. While Ambrose is hardly the only act in WWE that's ever been named or at least nicknamed after some sort of trait, event, or metaphor, "The Lunatic <em>on the</em> Fringe" or "<em>Mr.</em> Lunatic Fringe" would both sound better if one had to go for accuracy. Subverted when it was later revealed that it was a slogan for a radio station in his hometown of Cincinnati.</li></ul></div><hr>
