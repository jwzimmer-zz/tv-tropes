It was created in 2010 by one Weiming Huang/Leo Huang, the same person who created the especially popular Chinese cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/PleasantGoatAndBigBigWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/PleasantGoatAndBigBigWolf">Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf</a></em>.

Planet Xing itself happens to be especially technologically advanced, and most of the population consists of robots that act exactly like humans with the full range of emotions and such (although there are humans too, as well as some aliens and anthropomorphic cows and other animals).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Planet Gray's expansion agency sent out two of its fighters, General Big Guai/Big M. and Corporal Little Guai/Little M., to conquer Planet Xing. With them, the two had five Jixie stones that, in addition to being able to give an inanimate object life, contain immense power, more than enough to conquer a planet. However, due to their ineptitude, Big and Little M. lose all but one of the stones, and crash-land themselves on the planet.</p><p>On Planet Xing, a genius engineer, Doctor Zhai/Doctor H., finds four broken vehicles while searching through a rubbish dump for things to fix. Unbeknownst to him, these vehicles were hit by and somehow combined with the four Jixie stones. When Doctor fixes them and then a broken power line falls on them, the four vehicles are revived into four children with superpowers.

The Lookus dub calls it Planet Xing Xing, the Miao Mi dub calls it Star Planet (or Starry Planet), and the dub of Season 10 uses the name Planet Xing.</li><li> The Supermen's attacks are also changed in the Miao Mi dub. The "Happy S. Punch" is the "Iron Fist", the "Sweet Protection Bubble" is the "Sweetie Bubble", and the "Smart Magnet" is the "Flowering Heart Magnet" and Smart S.'s magnetic chain attack is called the "Flowering Heart/Romeo Magnet Chain".</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncredibleShrinkingMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncredibleShrinkingMan">Incredible Shrinking Man</a>: In Season 5 episode 47, Doctor H., who is being mind-controlled by Big M., uses a shrinking spray on the heroes, which also gets on Big M. and Little M. by accident.
