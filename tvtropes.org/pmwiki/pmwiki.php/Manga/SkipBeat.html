She doesn't care where her daughter is now, and may not have seen her in years, since in one flashback Shou's parents were seen wondering whether she was ever coming back to get her, and Kyouko seems to have spent much of the latter part of her childhood living at the ryokan. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The most recent chapters of the manga reveal that this may ultimately be a subversion on the part of Kyoko's mother too due to the complex circumstances around Kyoko's conception and birth, which lead to severe mental instability and Kyoko's mother choosing to give her up due to a belief she could not love and care for her as a parent should.</span></li><li> Subverted with a young Ren/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kuon</span>, who because of his initial reluctance to talk of his past and his angst about having to escape his father's hands is believed to have this, but when his father was actually introduced, the man was a very loving dad; turns out that both of his parents are <em>so</em> loving they don't let Ren breathe. Ren was angsting because his parents were kind of busy and he was having trouble finding his own identity when they were so famous, and this resulted to him being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">treated as an outcast by his peers</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>: Kyouko does an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example when she is cast as one of the villains in a remake of a late 80's drama. The character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> who harbours some major resentment towards her cousin, who is the heroine, and both her own older sister and mother (also villains). She uses the facial scar her character got from an accident, which her sister caused on purpose, to emotionally blackmail both her and their mother, who has always looked down on her youngest daughter. The original actress interpreted the character as an apparently timid girl who was not ashamed to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundedGazelleGambit">Wounded Gazelle Gambit</a> near constantly, using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeekABangs">Peek-a-Bangs</a> to conceal her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodScarsEvilScars">Evil Scars</a>.

Kyouko's justification is that, while the original interpretation was valid and all twenty years ago, she couldn't see the daughter of a rich family sporting such a big facial scar <em>now</em>: if you had gotten such a scar twenty years ago, you would have had to live with it, but nowadays you could easily get a plastic surgeon to erase or minimize it. Since the scar blackmailing is fundamental to the character and the plot, Kyouko decided to play her as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">kind of person that would have kept the scar on purpose</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss">Almost Kiss</a>: Many, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">many</a></em> times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">Anguished Declaration of Love</a>: Well, sort of:<div class="indent">Kyoko: Oh, this is like a confession of loooove! <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Most main characters are still ridiculously slim and spindly-limbed, but in the intervening years Nakamura has also expanded the variety of body types that show up on reoccurring characters - Chiori's manager is one of the few reoccurring characters to be drawn as a realistically heavyset middle-aged woman, and the taisho's wife has also consistently been portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChubbyMamaSkinnyPapa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChubbyMamaSkinnyPapa">plump motherly figure</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadJobWorseUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadJobWorseUniform">Bad Job, Worse Uniform</a>: The "Love Me" uniform is a glaringly pink jumpsuit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">Beauty Is Bad</a>: Played with.

The comic has run continuously since February of 2002, but in-series a little more than a year has passed since Kyoko moved to Tokyo:<ul><li> In early chapters, everyone uses flip phones. In act 32 Kyoko is given a flip phone by LME so she can carry out her duties as Ren's temporary manager, and chapter 48 shows Yashiro threatening to brick Ren's flip phone with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechBane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechBane">Walking Tech Bane</a> abilities. As of chapter 246 (published in early 2017), Ren has a modern smartphone capable of sending text messages (and presumably of sending videos, which he offered to do when Kyoko had to leave Guam before him).</li><li> In chapter 168 (published in early 2011) Kyoko still has a flip phone, but she's shown to be able to search the web on it (while attempting to look up a recipe for a rice dish Ren said he wanted to cook).</li><li> There are a few chapters dedicated to Ren's jealousy that one of his <em>Dark Moon</em> coworkers has managed to get Kyoko's e-mail before him. Ren is mildly upset that Kyoko sends this coworker a "decorated e-mail" from her phone, as Ren doesn't even have Kyoko's e-mail. As the series progresses, Ren badgers Kyoko about sending him text messages with emoticons <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1eirf');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1eirf" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1eirf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">emoticons are faces constructed out of text characters, like <strong>:-)</strong> or <strong>\(*o*)/</strong></span>.<ul><li> Hilariously, when they <em>do</em> eventually exchange emails with emoticons, they both misinterpret the meaning of the other's message because of them.</li></ul></li><li> Chapter 220 (published in early 2015) shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyoko's mother</span> reading Kyoko's biography on the LME website.

In conclusion, a pretty hard rebus to solve!<ul><li> As of chapter 200, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyoko has also fallen in love with Ren and Sho no longer holds the dominant place in her heart.</span> However, she's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">too afraid to pursue any kind of relationship</a>, so the triangle is still intact as far as Ren and Sho know.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: Ren's actual name, Kuon, means 'eternity', tying into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcSymbol">Arc Symbol</a> of the eternity sign that shows up in the interactions between himself and Kyoko.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MethodActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MethodActing">Method Acting</a>:<span style="display:none">invoked</span> As stated above, this is Kyoko's main way of acting. Occasionally she gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter">Lost in Character</a>. Examples include:<ul><li> Her early acting as a test-substitute for Ruri has Kyoko play a ryokan worker and sit in seiza on what is a heavily sprained ankle, yet retains a pleasantly smiling face towards 'the customer' Ren, as per her being taught to act like that by Shou's mother years ago. Despite being in tremendous pain while putting weight on the ankle, she doesn't slip up once... until the director realize she's pale, sweating and yet still remains in character, stating she will 'not leave her place until the customer leaves', which is when Ren steps off the stage and Kyoko faints.</li><li> Sho's music video in which she uses her own relationship with Moko to understand the sadness of killing a man her best friend loves and having her friend forever hate her, but also relishing in the joy of saving that same friend.</li><li> Kyoko does this when she gets into her character for Dark Moon. Everyone's shock is real because they didn't know how Kyoko would present her character. It was so unexpected and shocking that Director Ogata falls to his knees.</li><li> Kyoko got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInCharacter">Lost in Character</a> in the Box R arc. In character, she and some other girls were supposed to bully a girl in a cruel manner. Kyoko is so caught up in character that she begins to goad the rest of the girls into bullying the girl for real, forcing the girl to drink cup after cup of tea and nearly choking her. Even Kyoko is amazed at how far she went when she finally breaks character.</li><li> Enforced by Takarada when she played Setsuka Heel. Since she was supposed to always BE the sister, she ends up in a 24h Setsuka-mode for almost a week and only slips out of the role whenever something happens that actually troubles or irritated Kyouko enough to break character.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mukokuseki">Mukokuseki</a>: Especially in regards to hair color - the majority of characters are Japanese, and most of those characters have naturally dark hair. Those who don't have dark hair usually have an explanation for it:<ul><li> Kyoko starts the series with black hair, and is shown going to the salon to have it dyed a more trendy chestnut/ cinnamon brown (though it's closer to orange in the illustrations). When she shows up to audition for the role of the ninja Momiji in <em>A Lotus in the Mire</em>, the Producer dismisses her and two other girls with brown hair outright, because that hair color isn't conducive to playing a character in a period drama.</li><li> Although Sho's hair is usually drawn a more golden color, flashbacks to his childhood reveal that he had dark hair up until some time in middle school.</li><li> Kuu Hizuri, who is half American and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooForeign">half Japanese</a>, has bright blond hair. His natural hair color is unknown, but he dyes his hair to match his wife and son. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ren Tsuruga</span> has only ever appeared in public with dark hair, but his natural hair color is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "sparkling" blond. Additionally, he wear colored contacts to make his spring green eyes appear dark in order to pass for 100% Japanese when in reality he is only a quarter Japanese.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneMadeAwesome">Mundane Made Awesome</a>: Most of the stunts Kyoko pulls, including the Artistic Radish Peeling with BURNING POWER. And the less we talk about her imagination spots, the better. Incidentally, Daikon (as in radish) can also mean a Bad Actor, Kyoko probably didn't see the significance of this when she used it in her audition.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a>: Mostly parents in the setting tend toward the neglectful end of the spectrum, but Kuu's parental love is intense enough that he's jealous of the girl his son likes, and even <em>Takarada</em> calls his love excessive. He doesn't appear to have been intentionally controlling, just incidentally overbearing, but there haven't been enough flashbacks to be certain.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours">My Acting Is Stronger Than Yours</a>: This is Kyoko's motivation when it comes to even entering show-biz. Shou <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationalInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspirationalInsult">says she's too plain to ever beat him if she were to enter the business</a>, so she's intent on learning how to act and beat him. It's also one of her main motivations, initially, when it comes to Ren. She wants to be such an amazing actress that she'll out-act him and have him acknowledge this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWorkWithChildrenOrAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverWorkWithChildrenOrAnimals">Never Work with Children or Animals</a>: In-Universe. Kanae just doesn't like to work with children. Not because she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildHater">Child Hater</a> (she isn't), but because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she has a lot of younger siblings and nieces and nephews who can only be controlled by playful brute force, and she knows that she tends to act the same way with child actors, which is inappropriate behavior when the kid isn't related to you</span>. She has changed her mind a bit ever since she befriended Hiou though.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroToHisValet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroToHisValet">No Hero to His Valet</a>: Working in the Love Me section, which initially is a sort of dogsbody position, give Kyoko a close perspective on the private behavior of famous people, when they're not worrying about their images. A lot of them are jerks.<ul><li> Before that, she knew all Fuwa Shou's private behaviors, although he <em>was</em> her hero then, despite not deserving it on any level. She invokes this trope in retrospect during the Bridge Rock incident and in the very significant salt-passing incident during his PV.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nosebleed">Nosebleed</a>: Kyoko <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

So, so much. The reason for this is the "love" part of her brain died, and she can no longer take a hint when she should. In fact, Ren regulary gives her ridiculous rules and suggestions (only the second <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kiss</span> is a real one), solely to make sure that she doesn't just blindly walks along with someone flirting on her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHeadTaller">One Head Taller</a>: Kyoko and every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> in the series who's not Ren. She's closer to his sternum.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a>: Used a lot, mostly for drama. Most closely following the trope is when the part of Ren's violent meltdown in chapter 194 that Kyoko focuses on as showing things have gotten really messed up is that he's <em>broken character</em> to have it. The Tsuruga Ren she knows would not stop acting in the middle for personal reasons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">Being OOC is OOC, and therefore serious.</a><ul><li> This trope becomes a mass of confusion around Ren, who at one point had an OOC moment while he was an actor playing a different actor playing a different actor playing a psychopath. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The moment consisted of his actual identity being more violently insane than the serial killer he was playing.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">The Only One Allowed to Defeat You</a>: Kyoko's feelings toward Shou.

Her boyfriend at the time was her opposite: an easygoing, kind man who had failed the bar examination multiple times. He turned out to be a corporate spy who ended up taking key pieces of evidence left to Saena for review after befriending her, seducing her and drugging her. The lost evidence cost the case for the firm. Saena became pregnant with her boyfriend's child, Kyoko. In midst of the depression that ensued from her personal shame and feelings of failure, she missed the cut-off point for a legal abortion and in any case was emotionally conflicted about having an abortion. Her career was saved thanks to a senior partner and one of her coworkers who formed an independent firm and invited her to join. Saena did eventually become a very successful and well-respected attorney, if considered somewhat cold and unapproachable by most. The image of Saena as an extremely cold and inattentive mother as seen through Kyoko's eyes is thus explained, though not excused, by Saena's personal fear of being unable to love a child without reservation, lingering resentment over her lost career and personal betrayal, and the stress she likely experienced while being a small firm attorney starting over again.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassiveAggressiveCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassiveAggressiveCombat">Passive Aggressive Combat</a>: Tsuruga and Kijima have a very faux-friendly one over calling or texting as proxy to who is closer to Kyouko.

Kyoko and her best friend Moko end up doing a lot of acting once their careers get off the ground; Ren was already an established actor by the time the series started; and Sho, who is a pop star, ends up doing commercials and promotional videos regularly. Most of the in-series shows are type 1, where "characters are involved in the production of the show." Some examples include:<ul><li> <em>Ring-Doh</em>, a drama/ mystery film set near the sea, it stars Ren Tsuruga and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">LME idol</a> Ruriko Matsunai. One of Kyoko's first big jobs for the Love-Me Section was to escort Ruriko to the set of <em>Ring-Doh</em>. The set also became the site of an acting battle between Ruriko and Kyoko, which was all part of a ploy to cure Ruriko of her spoiled personality and habit of quitting when things didn't go her way.</li><li> <em>The Miraculous Language of Angels</em>, a play selected specifically by LME president Lory Takarada for the drama trainees to practice. Also counts as a type 4 example ["the internal show... is eerily similar to the real show"] because the conflict of the play (a little girl views herself as the cause of her mother's death and thinks her family blames her) mirrors the conflict that Lory's granddaughter Maria is having.</li><li> <em>Yappa Kimagure Rock</em>, the variety show where Kyoko lands a regular job as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingAnimalSuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingAnimalSuit">giant chicken</a>.</li><li> <em>Tsukigomori</em>, a drama series from 20 years ago that focused on Katsuki, a man hellbent on revenge against the corrupt Hongo family, who are responsible for the murder of Katsuki's parents and brother. To enact his revenge, he hides his identity and becomes engaged to Misao, the daughter of the family's patriarch. But Katsuki's plans for revenge are complicated when he finds himself falling for her cousin Mizuki, who is a kindhearted girl despite being brought up by her cruel aunt and uncle. Further complicating matters is Misao's little sister Mio, a tragically scarred girl with hatred in her heart, who begins to notice the budding attraction between Katsuki and Mizuki. Starred Kuu Hizuri (stage name Shuuhei Hozu) as Katsuki and Hiroko Iizuka as Mio, directed by Hirotaka Date.</li><li> <em>Dark Moon</em>, a remake of Tsukigomori that retained the same premise but diverged from the plot about half way through. Starred Ren Tsuruga as Katsuki, Hiroko Iizuka as Ms. Hongo, and Kyoko as Mio. Directed by Hiroaki Ogata (formerly Hiroaki Date).</li><li> <em>Box "R"</em>, a high school drama series about a good-natured girl who runs afoul of her school's biggest bully, a sadistic teen whose methods are a step up from the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShoujoBullyingTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShoujoBullyingTactics">Stock Shoujo Bullying Tactics</a>. Stars Kyoko as Natsu Kitazawa, the main antagonist; and Chiori Amamiya as Yumika, a member of Natsu's clique.</li><li> <em>Tragic Marker</em>, a supernatural horror/ thriller film about an undead serial killer called BJ who returns to wreck havoc years after being gunned down by the police. Notable in that for much of the filming, Ren needed to keep his identity a secret and lived under the guise of an actor named Cain Heel. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sensing that this might strain his already fragile psych, Lory created the role of Setsuka Heel for Kyoko to fill &mdash; Lory knew that Ren needed this role to beat his own inner demons, and he was willing to bet that Kyoko's influence would help Ren find some inner peace.</span> Stars Ren Tsuruga (under the alias Cain Heel) as Black Jack/ Killer BJ and Taira Murasame as Koji. Directed by Konoe.</li><li> <em>A Lotus in the Mire</em>, a historical piece about the Wandering Samurai "Shizuma." Both Kyoko and Kanae are vying for roles in this production: Kanae because Lory told her to and Kyoko because she wants to co-star with Moko.</li><li> <em>Purple Down</em> and <em>Purple Down II</em>, both of which were television series. Ren Tsuruga and Kimiko Morizumi co-starred in the second season. Notably, Kimiko Morizumi's father directed the second season, and she was able to use her connection with him to get herself cast.</li><li> The <em>Minamori Miyako</em> Series, a murder mystery series.

The ambiguity of whether things written in smalltext are actually said aloud is also leveraged regularly in the manga, leading to a number of jokes and subtleties that can't be transferred to the anime because time is the primary constraint of anime, rather than space.

They did some bonding over it anyway.<ul><li> The Omui Rice is revealed in a flashback in the next chapter to be related to the mysterious figure Rick, who seems to have been Kuon's mentor. Also revealed: Ren's mind <em>always</em> worked in strange and mysterious ways, and he used to be almost as bad as Kyoko about it.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">Trickster Mentor</a>: Takarada loves and cares for his chosen protegees, and they live in fear of his weird manipulations and the awkward situations they frequently cause in the name of their eventual emotional well-being. Ren especially, as his special project, is in the habit of assuming he has ulterior motives for pretty much everything. Usually he cannot figure out what these are until much too late.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity">Ultimate Job Security</a>: The director for <em>BoxR</em> should have been sued or something by now; a lot of the stuff he's been allowing or demanding from Natsu's group is actual, literal, unstaged torture of the actress playing the victim. Quite apart from the potential to set her on fire in the first scene, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">she had tea poured down her throat so she could either swallow or drown, while her head was wrenched back by her hair...</a> They play it as just one of those things that happen on the job!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a>: Invoked in series, as quite a few onlookers are thoroughly disturbed by the "Super Real Tsuragu Ren Special Size Doll" Kyoko gives Maria as a present - and that's before she introduces the swappable faces...<div class="indent"><strong>Yashiro:</strong> Am I the only one who thinks that doll looks a little <em>too</em> realistic?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>: Kyoko certainly at the beginning of the story was one. Now she'd be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictoriousChildhoodFriend">Victorious Childhood Friend</a>, except that she doesn't care for him anymore.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ren (while he was still Kuon/Corn) had a very important, if short, childhood friendship. But of course, only if the mangaka were to finally get them together.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>: What gives Kyoko her occasional superpowers, except when it's a burning will to fulfill some kind of duty. Also, Ren has a problem with this sometimes. By which we mean once. With a goon who never got another name than 'Seaweed-head.' It preoccupies him rather, though.<ul><li> It's not just once anymore. Apparently as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kuon</span> he had a bit of a rage issue, and giving into it was what <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">got Rick killed</span>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> that was Tsuruga Ren is cracking to bits, and he's become prone to fits of violence. Thus far, a fight scene rehearsal segued into an actual murder attempt against an aggravating co-star, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">shoved Kyoko around for contacting Shou</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoodooDoll">Voodoo Doll</a>: Odd for a manga about being an idol. Kyoko uses them alot, although some of her dolls, far from being creepy are actually rather cute.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxOnWaxOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaxOnWaxOff">Wax On, Wax Off</a>: The first part of Kyoko's sword training under Hio's grandfather Kotetsu Uesugi. After a brief assessment of Kyoko's swordsmanship, he tells her that she ought to stay off to the side and cheer for Kanae, even giving her a baton to twirl. Kyoko has no idea how to twirl a baton, but after four days of non-stop practice she can handle two of them at once. Instead of letting Kyoko back onto the dojo floor, Kotetsu gives her clubs and a gymnastics ball to practice with. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kyoko asks Hio if she's being shunned or if she's offended Kotetsu in any way, and Hio tells her that this is just his grandfather's method of training. The part that Kyoko wants to try out for is a ninja who uses two short swords, so having her get familiar with dual-wielding batons and clubs is only the first step of her training; Kotetsu eventually lets Kyoko participate in class with Kanae and his other students. And it turns out the the clubs had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordCane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordCane">blades hidden in the handles</a> &mdash; not only was Kyoko practicing how to manipulate two weapons at once, she was also learning the weight and balance of the weapon she would eventually take with her to the audition.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler">Willing Channeler</a>: Kyoko appears able to control the evil spirits that float around her, even holding people in place with them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>: Between Ren and Kyoko, to the point that a significant portion of the fan base has to take periodic breaks from the series due to sheer frustration.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWearsShortShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWearsShortShorts">Who Wears Short Shorts?</a>: As <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Setsuka, Kyoko</span> wears positively minuscule shorts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Even when she's wearing a pair under a long tunic, Ren-as-Cain-Heel asks her to put on pants. He's worried that on of his coworkers might be developing a crush on Setsuka, thanks in part to her flashy wardrobe.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou">Why Did You Make Me Hit You?</a>: Invoked by Kyoko and Moko when they're auditioning for an ad. The two were supposed to perform the roles of 2 best friends who got into an argument after one of them "stole" the guy the other has a crush on. Moko starts this by slapping Kyoko before breaking down in tears, forcing Kyoko to apologize.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomanScorned">Woman Scorned</a>: Kyoko, with good reason.</li></ul><hr>
