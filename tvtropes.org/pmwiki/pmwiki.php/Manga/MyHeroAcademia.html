He says that if Quirks hadn't appeared, humans would be taking interstellar holidays at that point in history. It's also confirmed to have been at least eight or nine generations since Quirks first developed, which is an unspecified amount of time in the future from present day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>:<ul><li> Endeavor only sees Shoto as a tool to surpass All Might and nothing more, as shown by the way he doesn't even refer to Shoto as a person, but "it". In a flashback, he put Shoto through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a>, which caused the child to vomit, and isolated him from his other children. Ironically, Shoto's burn mark didn't come from his father, but his mother, though Shoto still pins the blame on his father for driving his mother to that level of mental instability. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After All Might retires, however, he starts to realize how badly he has treated his family and is trying to make amends.</span> Worse, Shoto may not even be the worst victim of Endeavor's children.

She was a kind woman who encouraged Shoto to pursue his own dreams, but snapped due to a combination of the frustration for being used and the fact her children were beginning to look like Endeavor, which resulted in her dumping boiling water on Shoto's face in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfWeakness">Moment of Weakness</a>. It's implied that she was physically and/or mentally abused by Endeavor as well, given his intense treatment of Shoto and her fear of her own husband. She gets better later on after being hospitalized and isolated from Endeavor, and Shoto reconciles with her after the Sports Festival when he begins to realize that he wasn't the cause of her mental break.</li><li> Zigzagged with Mitsuki Bakugo.

Lady and Midnight's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">Cat Fight</a>.</li><li> In the anime, All Might's fight with Nomu takes a few minutes, consisting of All Might throwing the Nomu up and down and destroying the ground and the ceiling with his punches.</li><li> Due to working with tight deadlines in <em>Shonen Jump</em>, a lot of fights which aren't very noteworthy in the U.A. Sports Festival Arc get little or no attention in the manga, with some being skipped entirely. This is particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> in the case of Yayorozu's ill-fated bout with Tokoyami, which actually messes her up a bit emotionally, and Horikoshi chose to reduce it to a flashback. Season 2 of the anime wasn't tied down by such limitations and needed to fill up its allotted time, so all the minimized fights get the attention they truly deserve.</li><li> The Field Training Arc in the manga focuses primarily on Midoriya, Iida, and Todoroki's internships, leaving the others to cameos. The anime, however, devotes an entire episode to the internships of Uraraka, Bakugo, Kirishima and Tetsutetsu, Yaoyorozu and Kendo, Jiro, and Tsuyu, showing events that were only referenced in manga such as Tsuyu stopping a group of stowaways, and Uraraka's training under Gunhead.</li><li> In the Final Exams Arc, each student vs. teacher match goes one team at a time while the others wait and prepare strategies, unlike in the manga where all ten fights are ongoing at the same time. This gives the earlier matches a bigger disadvantage, but it does allow the anime to focus on each match instead of flipping around like the manga does. Thus, fights which happen offscreen in the manga, such as Iida/Ojiro vs. Power Loader, are shown. As a result, Midoriya doesn't watch the others after his match; instead, he is joined by Uraraka. Also, the anime devotes a bit more time to showing how the students prepare for the written exam.</li><li> The Forest Training Camp Arc has a few pages of Todoroki, Iida, Bakugo and Midoriya fighting against some of Pixie-Bob's rock creatures. The anime adaptation has a four-minute long sequence of the fight, showcasing each member of Class 1-A using their Quirks to fight them.</li><li> Episodes 54 and 55 expand upon the Provisional Hero License Exam Arc by showing what students other than Midoriya and Bakugo are doing while Class 1-A are separated: Todoroki battles a group of ninja, of which the manga only shows the aftermath, whereas Yaoyozoru, Jiro, Tsuyu, and Shoji get an anime-exclusive sequence where they deal with a coordinated attack by an all-girls school and Yaoyozoru in particular gets the chance to shine.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> Quirkless kids, who comprise only about 20% of the population, are essentially disabled, lacking something everyone else in their society has naturally. Not only will they be part of an ever shrinking minority, but they are far less powerful than their Quirk-having peers, and are prone to being bullied by said peers because of this.</li><li> Todoroki's backstory with his mother where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledAbuser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledAbuser">despite her love for him</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfWeakness">she still couldn't control her insanity and attacked him</a>. This mirrors several stories in real life where parents become their child's abuser due to their own trauma. In the scene before this, she's even on the phone with her own mother, telling her that she thinks she needs to leave Endeavor because she's scared of the way she feels about her own children.</li><li> Children like Kota whose parents die in the line of duty and leave them orphaned. It's for the exact reason above that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nana Shimura, All Might's predecessor</span>, gave away her child for adoption to a civilian family, so as to spare him/her the heartbreak and keep him/her away from danger, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having already lost her husband to a villain and then eventually meeting the same fate as he did</span>.</li><li> Midoriya's mother keeps seeing her son mutilating his body for his dream while villains attack him on a regular basis.</li><li> Overhaul's <em>horrendous</em> treatment of his "daughter" Eri comes to mind, in a case of parents who use their children like tools instead of treating them like human beings with feelings and manipulate them into willful obedience. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Plus, there's the fact that he subjects her to <em>physical torture</em> all the time by farming Quirk destroying bullets by <em>digging the raw material for them out of her own flesh</em>.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>:<ul><li> The U.A. Sports Festival gives a rather interesting and unconventional one: if you're in a competition, it's important to give it your all even if you have a massive advantage over the rest of the contenders. There are two reasons for this: the first is that if you underestimate your enemies it becomes easier for them to completely sweep you off your feet, as shown by Monoma and Bakugo both suffering humiliating defeats at the hands of others because they disregarded them as a threat. Monoma learns nothing from the experience, but Bakugo learns to judge others by their own merits, and as such secures a win from Uraraka after she lays a pretty devastating trap for him. The second is that if you don't give it your all, you're insulting your competitors and disrespecting their efforts. Todoroki holds back on his devastating potential and half of his Quirk, which results in a lot of people coming to dislike him. Despite having his own reasons to do so, Midoriya eventually reaches out to him and convinces him that his father's Quirk is his own.</li><li> Later on in the series, which again relates to Todoroki, there is a much more contentious and realistic one: when an abusive family member decides on their own to become a kinder person (whether the change is genuine or not), the people closest to them <em>will</em> have their own opinions on how they feel about the change, and it's important to acknowledge the validity of each of them. When Endeavor starts to mellow out and take steps towards being a better husband and father to his wife and children, each member has differing reactions, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">This Is Unforgivable!</a> (Natsuo), to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Turn the Other Cheek</a> (Fuyumi, and Rei to an extent), to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgivenButNotForgotten">Forgiven, but Not Forgotten</a> (Shoto).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGenesAreCodominant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGenesAreCodominant">All Genes Are Codominant</a>: Quirk inheritance sort of works this way. A child of parents with Quirks can get a Quirk that's a combination of both (such as Bakugo, whose mother secretes glycerin and whose father secretes nitric acid, thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast">explosion powers for him</a>, and Todoroki, whose father had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">fire powers</a> and whose mother had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnIcePerson">ice powers</a>, thus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">he gets both</a>). Other times, the child can get one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggleBornOfMages">or neither</a> of the parents' Quirks. There are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomSpeciesOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomSpeciesOffspring">rare mutations where a child has a completely different Quirk</a> from their family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a>: The bonus pages for the manga volumes sometimes reveal interesting details about characters or the setting, especially in the character profile pages. One page also explains how the law against unlicensed Quirk usage is enforced, and says that people generally don't get in trouble unless they cause harm to others. For example, Inko Midoriya could use her telekinetic Quirk to retrieve her cell phone without too many people complaining.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloneWithThePsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloneWithThePsycho">Alone with the Psycho</a>: Happens with Midoriya just before the training camp kicks off, when he encounters Shigaraki at the mall. He's only saved due to the timely arrival of Uraraka.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCatchphraseInflection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCatchphraseInflection">Alternate Catchphrase Inflection</a>: All Might always heralds his arrival with an uplifting and triumphant "I am here!". When he shows up at USJ to rescue 1-A from the League of Villains, he still says it, but in a low, intimidating tone because he's angry with the League for attacking his students.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>: The second popularity poll shows its participants in <a class="urllink" href="http://msleilei.tumblr.com/post/160490545659/removed-the-text-from-the-2nd-popularity-poll">fantasy clothing<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which was later expanded into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse">RPG-Mechanics Verse</a> through merchandise. This scenario is given a better look in the third ED of the anime, which shows all the characters adventuring in that world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysInClassOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysInClassOne">Always in Class One</a>: With only two classes of new students in the Hero Department, it was roughly a 50-50 shot. Despite this, everyone important still ended up being placed in Class 1-A. Putting all the strong Quirked kids in the same class makes sense, since their teacher can erase them if they get out of hand, and Class 1-A is being targeted since Midoriya is in it, so everyone in the class ends up being roped into importance. However, this still stands for him, since there's no reason Aizawa's class couldn't have been Class 1-B instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousTimePeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousTimePeriod">Ambiguous Time Period</a>: It's hard to tell when exactly the series takes place, other than it being in the future.

This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstructed</a> in the past, as the definition of "human" became very loose and humanity in general devolved into chaos, halting progress considerably.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>: Basically, if you see Yutaka Nakamura's name listed on an episode ahead of time, you can expect this to happen. Examples included:<ul><li> The finale of the fight between Midoriya and Todoroki gets a rather noticeable animation quality hike. It's rather breathtaking.</li><li> Bakugo blasting off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to escape the League of Villains and take Kirishima's hand</span> has a large spike in quality &#150; if not for the fact that such movements are impossible, it could be mistaken for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rotoscoping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rotoscoping">Rotoscoping</a>.</li><li> Midoriya and Bakugo's fight in Season 3 really ramped up the animation to the same level as Midoriya vs. Todoroki.</li><li> Perhaps not Nakamura, but most, if not all, of Mirio's fighting scenes. It's usually in the standard slow motion illustrated style, but even then the tiniest details are included, to the point that you can see Eri both flinch and widen her eyes in shock when he uses his Quirk to kick through her and she doesn't get hit.</li><li> When Midoriya uses Eri's Quirk to his advantage to go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">One For All: Infinite 100%</a> against Overhaul.

Even heroes in training aren't exempt from this rule, since their teachers have to give them express permission to do so lest they face the legal consequences. The only other exception is if the students earn a Provisional Hero License to act independently, as Class 1-A and 1-B attempt to do after the Hideout Raid Arc. This leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">The Greatest Story Never Told</a> after the Field Training Arc, since the police would legally have to punish Midoriya, Todoroki, and Iida for stopping Stain, even after they <em>stopped</em> him from <em>murdering</em> a pro hero. They were safe because there were no witnesses and agreed to let Endeavor take credit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then after the Hideout Raid Arc, Aizawa threatens his entire class with expulsion when Midoriya, Iida, Todoroki, Kirishima, and Yaoyorozu interfered in an official hero operation to rescue Bakugo from the League of Villains. They were all safe because everyone was focused on All Might's retirement following his battle against All For One (they had to rebuild trust with the faculty, though). It gets to the point that Aizawa knowingly allows Midoriya to participate in a dangerous investigation because otherwise he thinks Midoriya might go into the unofficial channels to be a Hero and eventually get himself arrested. If he's participating legally, at least he can do the right thing in the right way.</span></li><li> Turns out this happened to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villain Gentle</span>.

Recovery Girl is also situated in a more upscale location to monitor the events and perform first aid, and instead of being out on the field, Midoriya and Uraraka are watching the tests to observe, learn, and strategize from what their classmates fail/succeed at doing, and are here together because their training partners won't communicate with them (allowing for some light <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>). It's also a lot more like the Battle Trial Arc in this respect. Functionally, the story is still the same, just modified to be more convenient for a different format.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">Bystander Syndrome</a>:<ul><li> This is legally enforced.

For the results of the second popularity contest, Horikoshi drew the top 10 most popular characters in a fantasy style, with medieval clothes and weapons. Later, he drew other characters in the same style as side art. For the third ending for the anime, all the characters appear in their medieval outfits from before in a medieval setting completely unrelated to the actual story. The fourth popularity poll revisits this theme, with multiple characters updated versions of the costumes (reflecting either their increased master of their Quirks or, in All Might's case, his permanent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower">De-Power</a>) and characters making the top 10 for the first time getting their own medieval fantasy outfits.</li><li> During the USJ Arc, it's joked that Class 1-A thought the "Unforeseen Simulated Joint" stood for "Universal Studios Japan". In Episode 52, the joke is repeated when Aizawa leads Class 1-A to the school's TDL, the "Training Delicatessen Land", which Midoriya, Uraraka, and Ashido mistake with "Tokyo Disney Land" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWannaGetSued" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWannaGetSued">wonder if a mouse is angry at them</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallPutMeOnHold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCallPutMeOnHold">The Call Put Me on Hold</a>: This is the basic premise of the manga.

Being a superhero is a legitimate career option that requires a special education course. Hero jobs also vary depending on what area a person decides to specialize in, such as crime-fighting, disaster relief, team support, etc. The entire business is heavily regulated and up and coming heroes typically seek employment at agencies run by senior heroes in an attempt to make a name for themselves. The series focuses heavily on themes such as what it takes to be a superhero, the importance of society having a positive view of them, and why anyone would want to be a hero in the first place. Although (almost) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper">Everyone is a Super</a>, most people are not superheroes or supervillains, because most Quirks aren't particularly useful for crime or the fighting thereof; even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> winners still require intensive training to reach their full strength.

Almost every main character, hero and villain alike, is being influenced by the legacy of someone who came before them, which influences their characters. The series is largely about the transition from one generation of heroes and villains to the next, and how the legacy one generation leaves behind influences the generation that follows after:<ul><li> Midoriya and Bakugo are both trying to live up to the legacy of All Might, but have different ideas about what that means, leading to their rivalry.</li><li> Shigaraki is doing the same by trying to become a successor worthy of All For One.</li><li> Todoroki had his father's legacy unwillingly <em>forced upon</em> him, and is trying to create an identity of his own.</li><li> Several members of the League of Villains, like Dabi and Spinner, were inspired to become villains by the legacy Stain left behind.</li><li> The entire Meta Liberation Army is trying to carry on the Legacy of Destro.</li></ul></li><li> The manga explores themes of law and order on the one hand and freedom and license on the other. For example, you have occasions such as hero interns getting punished for getting into unlawful combat with a villain, even in self-defense, and the League of Villains attracting members in no small part with the promise of freedom to do whatever you want. There are even instances where the rules meant to create good heroes have caused certain forms of social stratification (U.A.'s hero exams are heavily geared towards those with Quirks directly capable of violence), and of course the allure of freedom and power and how it sometimes pulls in people who really shouldn't be heroes at all.</li><li> The advantages someone is born with vs. what they earn through hard work, and the danger of confusing the two (and confusing what someone <em>can</em> be born with and <em>can</em> earn through hard work).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster">Cerebus Rollercoaster</a>: The manga operates in this pattern, usually having a lighthearted arc followed by a darker arc. This becomes especially noticeable following the Hideout Raid Arc. This dark arc is followed by the more lighthearted Provisional Hero License Exam Arc, which is then followed by the even darker Internship Arc and the even lighter U.A. Cultural Festival Arc, with the lighter arcs all starting off with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episodes</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>: Ragdoll's Search Quirk is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">taken by All For One</span> between the Forest Training Camp Arc and the Hideout Raid Arc.

He makes another cameo in Chapter 3 during All Might's reflection on U.A. High.</li><li> Yaoyorozu got the second place in the class representative elections by having two votes: one of her own and other from someone who's never revealed. At the time, it was irrelevant, but after she goes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSelfDeprecation">Heroic Self-Deprecation</a> and becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Broken Ace</a>, finding out that the person to vote for her was Todoroki revitalizes her confidence in herself enough for her to get them to pass on the end of terms test.</li><li> Kirishima shows up several times in Chapter 3, though he's impossible to find unless you've read Chapter 144 and learned what he looked like before getting into U.A.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryBlossoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryBlossoms">Cherry Blossoms</a>: There's an incredible amount of cherry blossom symbolism in this series. When All Might announces Midoriya can be a hero, cherry blossoms fall to represent the blooming of a new hero. Notice the cherry blossom trees in in the background of the first opening between Midoriya and Bakugo representing the blossoming of rivals that will spur each other to greater heights.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">Chronic Hero Syndrome</a>: This is apparently quite common. All Might mentions that all the top heroes' stories include some iteration of "My body moved before I could think" when it came to their first acts of heroism. Midoriya doing the same in the beginning of the series is what wins him All Might's respect. Deconstructed a bit, in that the series recognizes how toxic this mindset can become, and actively chastises students for leaping in to help without considering the consequences of what they're doing. With Midoriya in particular, Aizawa stops him, reminding him that if he fails and gets hurt, he becomes one more problem for the pro heroes to worry about and another factor complicating the situation. "If you can't save yourself, you can't save anyone else" is a common theme.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircleOfShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircleOfShame">Circle of Shame</a>: Midoriya is repeatedly subject to this in his backstory, as everyone considered him a loser or weirdo for not being born with a Quirk and laughing in his face whenever his dream of becoming a hero gets brought up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKentOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKentOutfit">Clark Kent Outfit</a>: Many of the cast are curvier or more muscular than their civvies and school uniforms indicate; even some of the hero costumes are baggy enough to disguise what shape the heroes are in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a>: Several over the course of the series, often tied in with someone's character arc:<ul><li> Midoriya's is the Sludge Villain, where he proves that he has the heart of a true hero despite being Quirkless.</li><li> Todoroki's is Midoriya, who manages to put him on the road to embracing his fire powers as part of himself and overcoming his father's abuse.</li><li> Iida's is Hero Killer Stain, who forces him to face the fact that he has put his selfish desire for revenge over the greater good.</li><li> Bakugo's is All Might, forcing him to put his pride, anger, and rivalry with Midoriya aside in order to accomplish his goals.</li><li> All Might's is All For One, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">forces him to exhaust all of his remaining reserves of power in order to defeat him and forces him into retirement</span>.</li><li> Shigaraki's is Re-Destro, whose <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">destruction of his family hands leads him to remember his lost past and let go of his attachment to it allowing him to embrace joy and rage in order to push his Quirk to never before seen heights.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseOnTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloseOnTitle">Close on Title</a>:<ul><li> Episode 88, "His Start," has the title card come up after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Endeavor's victory over the High-End Nomu, which truly establishes him as the #1 Hero</span>, just before the end credits.</li><li> Chapter 285, "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Katsuki Bakugo Rising</span>" appears at the end of the chapter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which concludes with Bakugo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a> for Midoriya</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingConcealedInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingConcealedInjury">Clothing-Concealed Injury</a>: Five years prior to the main story, All Might suffered an injury that destroyed one of his lungs and most of his stomach, which left behind a scar.

He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bully">Bully</a> who takes pleasure in toying with and hurting Midoriya during their fight and is his most direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>.</li><li> USJ Arc: Shigaraki is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">Psychopathic Manchild</a> who uses video game metaphors all the time. He's an admitted villain who has big goals and despises All Might, unlike Bakugo. Furthermore, he isn't active in the forefront, as he prefers to let his minions do most of the fighting, and he knows that he's outmatched against All Might.</li><li> U.A. Sports Festival Arc: Todoroki is the main antagonist of the arc. He's a hero in training. Unlike Shigaraki, he's also much more stoic and composed than the previous antagonists. Also unlike them, he is outright shown as someone sad deep down and instantly befriends Midoriya once the arc is over. In contrast, Endeavor is the first hero to actually showcase how corrupt heroes can be.</li><li> Field Training Arc: Stain is a villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> that kills heroes that don't befit his ideals. The difference between him and Shigaraki is basically spelled out by Midoriya at the end of the arc &#150; unlike Shigaraki, Stain has an ideal and an objective to follow, while Shigaraki simply wants to see the world burn. Or, disintegrate.</li><li> Final Exams Arc: The teachers play the antagonist of the arc. The difference here is that they don't mean any harm to the protagonists and are only trying to test them.</li><li> Forest Training Camp Arc: The Vanguard Action Squad is a group of murderous criminals that get together under Shigaraki's command. They are very happy to murder people just for the fun of it and are much more competent than the original formation of many untrained thugs of the League of Villains.</li><li> Hideout Raid Arc: All For One, the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the story, steps down to take the center stage. Unlike those before him, he has no interest in anyone or anything but All Might and is much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a> than the teen/twenty-something villains of the League. He's also immensely more powerful and the fight against him is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> in itself.</li><li> Provisional Hero License Exam Arc: Yoarashi is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> of another school, with personal beef against Todoroki. Unlike the antagonists before him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassToOne">he's genuinely nice to everyone else most of the time</a> and is a loud and boisterous guy with a huge respect for heroes and heroes in training of all kinds. He's also capable of making amends to Todoroki &mdash; and later, Endeavor &mdash; after a while.</li><li> Internship Arc: Overhaul is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> with intention of taking over All For One's spot as the head of the organized crime. He lampoons Shigaraki for not having any plans and ambitions to do the same, while showcasing he has an organized and long-term plan to achieve his own goals. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He's also much more cruel than prior villains as he happily tortures and mentally abuses a little girl with the intention of creating his anti-Quirk serum. This isn't the part Shigaraki takes issue with.</span></li><li> U.A. Cultural Festival Arc: Gentle and La Brava are a duo of quirky, lovable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti Villains</a> with tragic backstories and broken dreams. They commit non-lethal crimes with the intention of gathering a fanbase and showing the errors of the heroes while having a much nicer relationship with each other than the prior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">Bad Boss</a> or lonely type antagonists before them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyEmptyBuilding">Conveniently Empty Building</a>:<ul><li> Discussed. During the Heroes vs. Villains training exercise, both Bakugo and Midoriya lose standing in the results for firing off massive blasts while indoors. The U.A. kids are taught from the very beginning to avoid property damage whenever possible because this isn't in play, and the series itself often shows civilians in buildings during times of crisis. In the Final Exams Arc, Midoriya and Bakugo even get points added for limiting damage from their own actions to the buildings that All Might has already destroyed rather than compromising the buildings that are still standing.</li><li> During the climax of the Internship Arc, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Overhaul goes on a rampage and damages many of the occupied houses around him and Midoriya, with one panel even showing a mother protecting her infant from falling debris. Midoriya uses a 100% kick to get Overhaul into the sky and away from the people.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsaccharineWorld">Crapsaccharine World</a>: Ultimately, the world of <em>My Hero Academia</em> boils down to this. The world population is 80% Quirk'd, meaning they have superpowers of some sort. These people can go to school to train to be heroes like All Might. As well, many of these heroes are revered for their acts to the point where there's a ratings system that places the popularity of these heroes. When you dig deeper, you find the darker side. The remaining 20% of humanity are Quirkless, are looked down on by those with Quirks and are denied a chance to be heroes because they would never "catch up". Even if you have powers, they may be pathetic or even "bad", meaning you could be looked down on for having undesirable powers. As well, many of the heroes out there aren't in it to make the world a better place, but for the fame and fortune. Not to mention that there are deranged people who're more then willing to use their Quirks to hurt people for any slight provocation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In fact, it's mentioned the present time of the manga is the stable society built <em>decades</em> after Quirks started appearing. The first few years were complete chaos from utter lawlessness as no one knew how to handle things at the time, allowing criminals to build their empires (one of which was All For One) and fighting in the streets with superpowers was a natural occurence.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnHero">Create Your Own Hero</a>: All Might and Midoriya's Quirk "One For All" was created by a villain who could give and take Quirks. The villain gave a Quirk to someone who already had one, which led to One For All's formation. The users of One For All all opposed the villain, and the villain was eventually defeated by All Might.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>: It's acknowledged a few times that the entrance exam to get in U.A.'s Hero Course is overly geared towards combat-oriented Quirks, leading to people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">Shinso</a> who have powerful Quirks that just happen to be useless in this particular test.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCatchAndCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCatchAndCarry">Crisis Catch And Carry</a>: Happens on several different occasions during the Forest Training Camp Arc:<ul><li> Mustard's gas attack renders many of the students unconscious, leaving their peers to carry them to safety. Of particular note is Todoroki, who spends the entire arc with Tsuburaba on his back, even while fighting against Moonfish.</li><li> Even though he himself is injured from his fight with Muscular, Midoriya still tells Kouta to get on his back, so that he can take him to safety. Then the two of them meet up with Aizawa, and Aizawa carries Kouta back to camp.</li><li> After saving Midoriya from Tokoyami, Shoji comments that Midoriya shouldn't be moving around in the state he is in, and spends the rest of the arc carrying him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a>: Implied. All For One claims that the way Nana Shimura died was "Just pathetic."

The first against Ojiro and Hagakure during the Battle Trial, when he freezes them along with the entire building, enabling him to seize the bomb without any resistance. The second is against a group of villains during the USJ Arc. The third is against Sero during the U.A. Sports Festival tournament, whom he freezes with one massive attack.</li><li> Tokoyami provides one against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Moonfish</span> during the Forest Training Camp Arc <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Dark Shadow goes out of control</span>.</li><li> In Chapter 87, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the combined pro hero and police force utterly decimates the League of Villains and rescues Bakugo without a hitch, completely preempting Midoriya and his friends' plans to rescue him.</span></li><li> In Chapter 88, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All For One returns the favor by kidnapping Bakugo <em>again</em>, ambushing the police force with a fraction of the Nomu army, and takes out several pro heroes who were at the Nomu factory in <em>less than a second</em> with the No. 4 hero Best Jeanist among them.</span></li><li> Mirio delivers one to the entirety of Class 1-A, taking the whole class (except Todoroki, who declined to participate, and Bakugo, who was still on house arrest) down within the span of few minutes, including beating all of the long ranged fighters in less than six seconds.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurtainsMatchTheWindows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurtainsMatchTheWindows">Curtains Match the Windows</a>: There are many characters in this series whose hair color is identical to their eye color, especially among Class 1-A.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a>:<ul><li> Zigzagged during the entrance exam. Uraraka is trapped beneath heavy rubble when a massive hazard-bot suddenly appears in the middle of U.A.'s practical exam. She manages to escape under her own power while Midoriya is busy demolishing the robot and gets to rescue him before he faceplants from fifty stories up.</li><li> Invoked by the HUC (Help Us Company), who are <em>professional</em> damsels in distress. This is justified as their role is to judge an aspiring hero's ability to handle the situation during crises, and they have terrifying eyes for details in this case.</li><li> During the Internship Arc, Eri is held captive within Overhaul's HQ. She did, in fact, find a way out on her own, but goes back because she feared Overhaul would kill the first people she met outside. Recusing her then becomes a driving force for Midoriya and Mirio.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower">De-Power</a>: A chilling threat in a society where nearly everyone is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">Differently Powered Individual</a>:<ul><li> Aizawa has the power to depower others for as long as he avoids blinking.</li><li> All For One can steal Quirks, resulting in this happening to his victims.</li><li> Overhaul and company are working on drugs that stop a person's Quirk factor.

Discussed by the proctors, who point out that the robots not being treated as hazards to be avoided has a different psychological effect on the kids.</li><li> There are more than one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> Nomu, but the first one is the most refined of them all, as it is made for the goal of defeating All Might.

All the girl-on-girl fights that happen throughout the series are largely incidental and have little to do with the fighters' sex. The U.A. Sports Festival tournament especially subverts this completely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>: The "You can accomplish anything if you try hard enough and never give up, no matter the personal cost" mindset is played as destructive, as the main characters suffer great injury because of it. For example, Iida sustains nerve damage in his arm, whereas Midoriya suffers permanent damage to his arms as a result of going all out against Muscular.<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">On the other hand</a>, it's played straight depending on the situation - Uraraka goes all out during her fight with Bakugo at the Sports Festival, which impresses the audience and lands her many internship offers, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Bakugo</a> considers her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, while Mirio devotes his life to mastering his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> Intangibility Quirk. He ends up as one of the Big Three at U.A, and is considered good enough to be a pro hero already.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidYouJustScamCthulhu">Did You Just Scam Cthulhu?</a>: In Kirishima's backstory, he witnesses Ashido talking down a destructive villain by lying to his face, and the villain leaves peacefully after thanking her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The "Cthulhu" part is later taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> when it's revealed that said villain is actually Gigantomachia, All For One's bodyguard and most powerful lieutenant.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">Differently Powered Individual</a>: By the time the story takes place, these represent the <em>majority</em> of the population, with a whopping 80% possessing some type of Quirk. Most simply continue to live ordinary lives, though, with only a small number becoming full-on superheroes or supervillains. This is inverted with Quirkless people, individuals with no superpowers who make up only 20% of the population.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>: During Bakugo and Uraraka's fight, many spectators start booing the former for not going easier on a girl. Aizawa immediately calls them out for this; this is the same audience who were fine with the three other male vs. female matches, including a boy who could shoot lasers against a female opponent. The only difference is that Bakugo is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">an unlikable jerk</a>, therefore the audience assume everything he does is to bully his opponent. Not only that, but he calls out the crowd for assuming that Uraraka needs going easy on, and reminds everyone that for Bakugo to underestimate her would be a severe mistake and insult.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerBeginning">Downer Beginning</a>: The story opens with a scene of a four-year-old Midoriya getting the crap kicked out of him by Bakugo before being left, beaten and bruised while noting that "All men are not created equal." The story then jumps to his last year of middle school, where he's mocked by his entire class, has one of his prized notebooks scorched and thrown out a window, and is nearly murdered by a villain in the span of a few hours. After that, things seem like they'll get better when Midoriya meets his idol, All Might, only to be told that it's impossible for him to become a hero without a Quirk, grinding all of Midoriya's hopes and dreams into fine powder. Even after he rushes in to help Bakugo (to no avail, mind), Midoriya still gets chewed out by the heroes and is ready to resign himself to a life of mediocrity. After all of this, this is finally subverted when All Might chases him down to apologize and tell him the five words he wanted to hear his entire life: "You can become a hero."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dualvertisement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dualvertisement">Dualvertisement</a>: In the run-up to the anime's third season, a series of ads were produced to promote the Japanese release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>, where All Might asks the members of Class 1-A which Avenger they admire the most.

This means that he doesn't have much power left to fight with when the League of Villains makes their debut and he has to fight the impact-absorbing Nomu. Forcing himself past his limits to win the fight accelerates the weakening of his powers considerably.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyBirdCameo">Early-Bird Cameo</a>: The second opening and ending of Season 4 both serve as early showcases for a number of characters way before any of them will show up. In the opening, Hawks, Gentle and La Brava all show up before being properly introduced. In the ending, this includes a young Mirko playing volleyball in gym class, younger versions of Gentle and La Brava in school, as well as Takeshita side by side with Gentle, a young Hawks being trained by the government and Natsuo in a picture together with Fuyumi.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">The early characterization of several characters is highly different than what becomes of them in later chapters</a>:<ul><li> Midoriya is shown to be pretty resentful towards Bakugo at the outset of the story because of Bakugo's bullying in the first chapter, albeit not resentful enough that he wouldn't risk his life to save him from the Sludge Villain. This is a stark contrast to the later Midoriya, who still admires him and is optimistic that he can still be friends with him.</li><li> In the first chapter, Bakugo always wears a smug grin on his face. Since then, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner">Perpetual Frowner</a> whenever he's not in a fight. This is justified, because in the first chapter he is surrounded by his friends and practically revered, and every other chapter after that challenges his ego either directly or indirectly and puts him in a situation where he has to change in order to be accepted by most of the class. Bakugo also seems to be more concerned about his reputation early on, calling out his friends for smoking because doing so could damage his chances of enrolling at U.A. Later on, Bakugo largely doesn't give a crap about the opinions of others and frequently does stuff that would frankly embarrass any educational institution.</li><li> A lesser example is with Iida. At the U.A. entrance exam, he is rather severe towards Midoriya and has a rather severe expression the entire time. Though he and Midoriya quickly become friends on the first day of school after the former apologizes for how he acted, Midoriya is initially unhappy to learn that they're in the same classroom. His hairstyle is different at first, initially being an undercut style. Shortly after school begins, it has grown out to a more generic hairstyle.</li><li> Early chapters paint Todoroki with a rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyEvil">Ambiguously Evil</a> vibe that never appears again: he is unwilling to kill a villain less out of moral decency and more out of preservation for his reputation, and for that, doesn't even try to save the villain, just tells him to get out of the ice soon or else he would tarnish Todoroki's reputation. Then his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast">Dark and Troubled Past</a> comes to light and we are given an explanation for why he behaves so grimly, and Midoriya yanks him out of his grudging state. Also, at the beginning, his left half is always encased in ice. Following the USJ Arc, however, he stops doing this, and no one comments on it.</li><li> Though it is partially because he is regularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffModel">Off-Model</a>, Koda looks fairly different early in the manga. Early on, his looks emphasize his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockMonster">Rock Monster</a> traits more heavily, but as the story goes on, he begins to look less ugly and more nervous, fitting his personality more.</li><li> During the USJ Arc, Shigaraki is very fond of video game lingo and metaphors, such as calling All Might the "final boss" of the USJ invasion, or remarking that Bakugo's at "full health" after fighting the villains. This aspect shows up less as time goes on.</li><li> Tsuyu and Mineta seem to be part of Midoriya's circle of friends, as they work together at USJ and they are the only ones apart from Uraraka and Iida to visit him while he is hospitalized during the U.A. Sports Festival. After that, they don't spend all that much time with Midoriya compared to his other classmates and are at best acquaintances; Tsuyu spends most of her time with Uraraka and the other girls, whereas Mineta is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a>.</li><li> Tsuyu seems to get along with Mineta in spite of his perverted behavior, as she legitimately praises his skills during the USJ Arc, they work together during the Sports Festival, and they visit Midoriya during his aforementioned Sports Festival hospitalization. Now, she, like the rest of the girls in Class 1-A, can't stand Mineta due to his perverted behavior.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUniversityHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUniversityHigh">Elaborate University High</a>: U.A. has buildings devoted to teaching and classes, dorms after it becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchool">Boarding School</a>, an Olympics-sized sports stadium, and several city-sized complexes that are used for hero training.

Each of the lights that appear in their mind while tapping into the Quirk represents a previous wielder. The anime frequently depicts All Might and Midoriya standing in front of blinding light with their back to the viewer, showing their roles as the current and future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">Hope Bringer</a>. Sometimes they're even shown emitting light from their fists as they're punching someone. The future shown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanColdOpen">Batman Cold Open</a> of Season 2 has Midoriya's punch coincide with the rising of the Sun, seemingly illuminating the world in the process.</li><li> Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant">Shigaraki</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">All For One</a> are heavily associated with shadows and darkness. Their lair is a dim, secluded bar, they both dress in all black, and both of them are evocative of the unsavory underside of hero society. Even Kurogiri, their personal attendant who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingUpPortals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThinkingUpPortals">can create warp gates</a>, has them step out of murky black fog as they're being transported.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Elemental Rock&#150;Paper&#150;Scissors</a>: Quirk advantages are a concept that's been there since the first chapter. They're often basic like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">wood manipulator</a> being weak to fire, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingAShadow">shadow beast</a> user being weak to anything that can produce reasonable light.

When Tsuyu checks All Might, he laughs because the movements tickle him. Tsuyu assumes All Might simply broke character.

Not a single U.A. student has been confirmed to be in a relationship or has ever been in a relationship. With students in the hero course so focused on becoming heroes, the series places way more emphasis on friendships and teamwork than romance. During the rare times romance is brought up, it's usually thought of as a distraction to hero careers. That said, they are all high school freshmen at a new school, most of them not knowing each other before entering U.A., so it makes sense they haven't immediately hooked up with each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuper">Everyone is a Super</a>: By the time the series begins, 80% of humanity has some kind of Quirk, and it's noted that Quirklessness becomes less common with each generation; it was relatively common when All Might was young, but Midoriya is the only student in his middle school without a Quirk. That said, most humans aren't superheroes. Inverted with animals, with only a rare few obtaining Quirks and fewer having the kind of intelligence it takes to refine them. The principal of U.A. is one such animal.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsCool">Evil Is Cool</a>: Stain is seen as this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, but this is deconstructed. The manga shows how damaging the concept can be to society, especially to young people, since the attention Stain gets from the media encourages already troubled people such as Toga and Dabi to become full time villains and follow in his wake. This is also troublesome because even if these villains are cool, they are still evil, and his publicity resulted in people buying merchandise of him and Kaminari even praising him <em>around Iida</em>, whose brother Stain permanently crippled.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">Evolutionary Levels</a>: Apparently, people with Quirks lack a joint in their pinkie toe.

In fact, within the system that ranks heroes, public approval ratings are even directly taken into account.</li><li> Because of its large national audience, students of U.A. have the chance of making their name known across the whole nation at the U.A. Sports Festival.</li><li> Even compared to other U.A. students, Midoriya's class became famous after they were able to repel a villain ambush during one of their lessons. It actually caused them to overshadow the other U.A. students at the above-mentioned Sports Festival as the media and audience paid more attention to them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>:<ul><li> When Quirks first began to emerge, people who developed them were ostracized by society &agrave; la <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>, but now that the majority of people in the world have powers, it's the powerless who are at a disadvantage. Even those who have odd appearances as a result of their Quirks aren't notably discriminated against, save for a rare faction that discriminates against "mutant" type individuals.</li><li> Chapter 171 reveals the existence of a villain known as Destro, who is or was the leader of the "Metahuman Liberation Army", suggesting that at some point, those with Quirks fought back against those who ostracized them in the early days of powers coming into existence.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatFlex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatFlex">Fat Flex</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">All Might</a> describes his superpower to be similar to this. Just like a normal human can puff their chest to look stronger, he too can redistribute his body's energy output to turn from a skinny bloke to a superhuman form. However, doing so puts a heavy strain on his body, even more so after he got a lung ripped out in battle and so has had his transformational time halved.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeelingOppressedByTheirExistence">Feeling Oppressed by Their Existence</a>: This is pretty much the mentality of how a lot of the villains operate. They don't like living in a time where you can be arrested for simply using your Quirk or have a much harder time committing all the havoc and villainous acts they want to accomplish. As such, they wish to change the system to suit their own means.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDisability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalDisability">Fictional Disability</a>:<ul><li> 20 percent of the population is born Quirkless, having no superpowers to call their own. While they can still go about a mundane life without a problem, Quirkless people like Midoriya are magnets for bullying and scorn and are heavily discouraged from trying to become heroes.</li><li> In Chapter 168, it's revealed that some people have Quirks that aren't compatible with their biology. For example, Aoyama's Navel Laser can seriously injure him from overuse, due to a birth defect. This also explains why nobody really batted an eye when Midoriya kept severely injuring himself in the earlier story arcs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">Filler</a>:<ul><li> In the anime, there are moments here and there of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>, such as getting to see the U.A. Sports Festival fights that are off-panel in the manga, with many confirmed canon such as Yaoyorozu's fight with Tokoyami. However, episode 19 of Season 2 is technically the first true filler episode that delves into some of the post-Sports Festival internships of the U.A. students while Midoriya recovers in the hospital following the fight against Stain. One noteworthy internship that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">given the spotlight</a> here is the one for Tsuyu, which shows the entirety of the mission she's on dealing with a group of villains on a naval ship. These events, at least in the case of Tsuyu, are a case of adaptation expansion/canon too, as they're all referred to as occurring in the manga, just offscreen. It's still technically filler, though, in that unlike the U.A. Sports Festival, no manga events take place in the episode with it.</li><li> Season 3 opens with a swimming competition between Class 1-A that's never in the manga in a long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em>. The episode, however, has comparatively less fanservice than what's usually seen in this situation, which is lampshaded when Kaminari and Mineta try to check out the girls in bikinis, only to find out that they're wearing full body swimsuits; if anything, the fanservice comes from the male characters who only wear shorts. Said episode also serves as a recap for the previous two seasons.</li><li> Also in Season 3, a few segments are added for the Provisional Hero License Exam Arc that aren't in the manga. One showcases Todoroki vs. a class of ninja-themed students. The other pits a team of Yaoyorozu, Tsuyu, Jiro, and Shoji against an all-girl squad led by a hyper-intelligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStrategist">strategist</a>.</li><li> Probably the straightest filler episode in the entire series thus far occurs in Episode 20 of Season 3 which serves partially as a backdrop to promote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademiaTwoHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyHeroAcademiaTwoHeroes">Two Heroes</a></em> and partially just to have fun with six of the most significant/popular members of Class 1-A (the main five and Tsuyu) as they try to solve a hostage situation/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedRoomMystery">Locked Room Mystery</a>. The anime actually lampshades how blatant it is in the prologue when a confused Midoriya points out to All Might that they are supposed to be in the middle of getting their provisional hero licenses while All Might just tells him to ignore it for now and have some fun.</li><li> Season 4 begins with a filler recap episode, this time involving a freelance journalist, Taneo Tokuda, coming to interview Class 1-A about their new dorm life. The recap aspect of the episode is heavily downplayed, however, as it focuses more on Taneo secretly serching for All Might's successor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceDuo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireIceDuo">Fire/Ice Duo</a>: Invoked by Endeavor, who wanted a child with a strong Quirk, and so sought out a woman with a strong ice Quirk to complement his fire Quirk and trapped her in marriage. She eventually gave birth to Shoto Todoroki, who can generate fire from his left side and ice from his right. However, rather than simply being a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">Combo Platter Powers</a>, the fire and ice explicitly serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">Required Secondary Powers</a> to each other, allowing Shoto to regulate his body temperature, and thus sidestep the drawbacks of overusing one power or the other.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFlameOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFlameOfLife">The Flame of Life</a>: The remnants of the quirk One For All still within All Might are described by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis">Arch-Nemesis</a> All For One as dying embers.

Although it's possible for a Quirk to grant more than one power, it's rare for one to grant completely <em>unrelated</em> powers, meaning flight+strength+speed+durability is a rare sight. Most heroes are lucky to have just one of those qualities and have to rely on teamwork and ingenuity to win more often than brute force. It's one of the reasons All Might, having three out of four of those classic traits (sans flight), became so exceptional.</li><li> A few of the rare straight examples include Captain Celebrity in the <em>Vigilantes</em> spinoff (whose exact Quirk is considered a national mystery much like All Might) and Nana Shimura, though only through supporting her natural flight Quirk with One For All's strength. Endeavor also somewhat counts since he can propel himself with fire, though he usually doesn't bother flying much.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodBasedSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoodBasedSuperpowers">Food-Based Superpowers</a>:<ul><li> Sato's Quirk, Sugar Rush, revolves around him consuming a lot of sugar and gaining a temporary boost of strength and energy.</li><li> Tamaki Amajiki, hero name Suneater, can transform his body based on any food he has recently eaten.

So, assuming he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">isn't lying</a>, we can assume he succeeds in the end.</li><li> Midoriya's narration in Chapter 46 indicates that something bad will happen to Iida.

These hint to the eight previous holders of the Quirk, with Midoriya being the ninth successor.</li><li> All Might explains that One For All cannot be stolen. Though it seems that this statement should be normal given that it is a Quirk that is transferred between people, this becomes an important clue later on when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All For One shows up</span>.</li><li> All Might gives Midoriya a training regime to prepare him for U.A. Midoriya quickly starts going beyond the limits the plan called for, causing him problems with overwork. Not only does Midoriya hurting himself from pushing himself too far become a recurring element of the series, but the differences between his and All Might's personalities seriously hamper their teacher-student relationship.</li><li> Early in the USJ Arc, Kirishima describes his Quirk as not at all "flashy" and thinks it would be easier for him to be a pro hero if he had a flashier moniker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Come the Work Study Arc, it's revealed that during middle school, around the time Bakugo and Midoriya fought the Sludge Villain, Kirishima was having self-doubts about his chances at being a hero, even giving up on going to U.A. at one point.</span></li><li> In the opening shots of the second opening, Midoriya can clearly be seen. Note the sleeves on his arms, which seem to have been torn off. This is a hint to the permanent damage he'll do to his arms at the end of the arc.</li><li> During the last thirty seconds of the third opening, one gets a decent shot at all the major members of the League of Villains, including its real leader, as the shadow behind them heavily resembles All For One.</li><li> During the Remedial Course Arc, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> theory called the "Quirk Singularity" is introduced. Later on during the Joint Training Arc, it's revealed that One For All is a perfect example of this theory, having grown strong enough in power over the first eight generations to allow the ninth wielder, Midoriya, to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not just interact with the "ghosts" of his predecessors, but also allow him access to their Quirks.</span> Although that means Midoriya will be more powerful than all of his predecessors by far, it also means he'll have an even more difficult time mastering One For All than initially thought.</li><li> In the climax of the first volume of the light novels, when a villain takes Class 1-A's parents hostage, who are visiting for Parents' Day, Inko Midoriya calms down a belligerent Mitsuki Bakugo by telling her, "We're hostages, remember?" This sounds like Inko's trying to remind Mitsuki of the danger they're in, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out to be a warning not to break character, as the entire thing is just an exercise</span>.</li><li> All Might explains that One For All is passed down from each generation to the next while accumulating power with each generation adding to it. Later, when Midoriya starts to see the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">vestiges of the previous One For All users</span>, they have a life of their own and aren't just memories or remnants. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is a major hint that not only does One For All gain power for each successive generation but also gains the Quirks of the holders of One For All. Now that One For All has become strong enough, not only can the vestiges communicate with the current wielder, but they can also lend them their powers.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a>: Midoryia feels that if hadn't chosen to fight Muscular, resulting in his arms being injured, he may have been able to stop Bakugo's abduction, which is what led to the Heroes raiding the League of Villains' hideout and All Might's confrontation with All For One, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">and resulted in All Might using up the last of his Quirk and retiring</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting">Four Lines, All Waiting</a>:<ul><li> There's the main plot, which is society attempting to raise a new generation of heroes.</li><li> Midoriya is struggling desperately to become All Might's replacement as the Symbol of Peace without dying along the way.</li><li> The League of Villains is trying to remake society in its own image while grooming a new leader to answer the Symbol of Peace.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">Character Focus</a> continually jumps around, from Todoroki to Iida to Kirishima, with major characters All Might, Bakugo, and Uraraka flitting in and out along the way.

When teachers arrive at the aftermath of the fight between them, Gentle says he just stumbled while Midoriya says they had a bit of a dispute.

The rest of the manga runs along these lines and makes it clear that from birth, there are those who were born with the deck stacked against them and those who were born with the deck in their favor, and sometimes, people have privilege in some things and not in others.</li><li> The harsh truth dealt to Midoriya throughout the first chapter is that sometimes dreams don't come true no matter how much you yearn for it. Without a Quirk, resources, or training, he had practically no hope of becoming a hero, and everyone from his teachers to All Might told him in no uncertain terms to give up on his dream and go find more realistic employment.</li><li> Of the unconventional but real variety, and more of a message than an proper Aesop.

In fact, Midoriya suggests that Uraraka's motives are more grounded in reality than his own desire to become a hero.</li><li> The plotline about Endeavor's relationships to his family ends with one: There is no right answer to whether you should forgive your abuser. Fuyumi decides to forgive her father and attempts to bring her family together. Natsuo blows up at his father and refuses to listen to him. Shoto reserves his judgment, stating that he is not forgiving him, but he is acknowledging that Endeavor is trying to change and that people do change. Even Rei acknowledges that, although she does not want to see him again, that he is making an effort. None of the characters are portrayed as in the wrong and Endeavor acknowledges that all of them are entitled to the reactions they had. He even tells Natsuo that it's fine not to forgive him, and has a new home built for his wife and children, partly for their safety and partly because he believes they would be better off without him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">Hate Sink</a>:<ul><li> Until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> starts to kick in, Bakugo is an abusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> with a bad temper. In particular, he looks down on and bullies Midoriya. This includes him telling Midoriya to kill himself and him trying to all but murder Midoriya during the Battle Trial Arc. After he receives several ego-shattering defeats, he starts to mellow out. Horikoshi has stated that he regrets making Bakugo so horrible early on.</li><li> At first, there is almost nothing redeemable about Endeavor.

The closest thing he has to a redeeming quality is his concern for Shoto holding back in battle, but even that is for his own personal gain. Even Horikoshi calls him a shitty dad. Outside of that, he's shown to be an asshole on the job, being a hero in the most technical of terms. He's very cold to fellow heroes and the people he's trying to save. This is subverted, however, when he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a> and begins changing.</li><li> Muscular, a villain who joins the League of Villains and helps them attack the training camp, endangering the lives of teenage heroes in training.

When he acts to rescue his former bully, he is chastised by the public for rushing in without a Quirk and gives up on his dream.

Though Midoriya doesn't finish in first place in any of the tests (since the one test he uses his Quirk for, throwing a baseball for distance, is the one where Uraraka has already scored <em>infinity</em> by making her ball weightless and throwing it into outer space), some of his classmates have Quirks that would be useless in all eight of the tests.

Bakugo has always been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> at his school. Gifted with a powerful and rare Quirk, athleticism, and the smarts to easily triumph over every obstacle laid before him, the non-stop stream of praise he received for his talents gives him an enormous ego. By contrast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a>, Midoriya, has always been meek and insecure due to lacking a Quirk and being mocked for it by his peers.

Fittingly enough, Bakugo is placed on the Villain team, becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>.

On the other hand, it's often treated as a very minor crime and offenders are usually just given a warning or long lecture if they happen to get caught. That said, should someone be arrested for it, that person is named a villain. In the <em>Vigilantes</em> spin-off, a police officer mentions she will have to write a letter of apology for using her Quirk to free hostages. When Class 1-A are under attack from the League of Villains, Aizawa has to give them express permission to use their Quirks to enter combat or else they'll face legal ramifications. Even using Quirks for non-combat purposes requires a license to be legal. There is also a fair bit of inequality here, as someone with a reletivly harmless quirk, or one not easily noticed might never have to worry about using thier quirk in public, while someone with a flashy quirk could face serious consequences just using it once.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Jerkass Has a Point</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JerkassHasAPoint/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JerkassHasAPoint/MyHeroAcademia">Has its own page</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassRealization">Jerkass Realization</a>: After All Might cedes his place as #1 hero, Endeavor understands a bit too late that not only everything he did was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a> but, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> fighting the advanced Nomu called "High End", which leaves his face with a huge scar on the same side as Shoto, he realizes that he's indeed not as good as All Might and can't be as effective as his rival, despite his best efforts.</span> He keeps on reflecting on his life and understands that his pursuit of "winning at all costs" was empty and one-sided and only got him to completely screw up his family.

Most noticeably, Midoriya becomes the ninth user of "One For All" after All Might, the eighth user, passes it on to him. In this case, however, it's the passing down of a specific superpower as well, much like the example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Ant-Man</a>.</li><li> The second is a heroic legacy in a family, most prominently displayed in the Iida family. Tenya Iida's brother Tensei, in particular, is the much-beloved engine hero Ingenium, and Tenya inherits the name when Tensei is forced into retirement after being paralyzed by Stain, though Tenya has some issues getting to the point where he feels he can actually accept it.</li><li> The third is similar to comic book legacy titles. Kirishima wishes to become a hero like the similarly powered Crimson Riot, and so has his hero name modeled after him. He even gets a couple of spotlight chapters showing how he came to understand Crimson Riot's mentality, and near the end of them a pro hero accepts him as worthy of the name after the courage and tenacity Kirishima has displayed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a>: The League of Villains, a group of villains who team up to kill All Might.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">Leitmotif</a>: Starting in Season 2, the anime starts to give out themes to certain characters:<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97rea-g1KXA">"Bombing King"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Bakugo's theme.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKBevxvmKcw">"Ingenum"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, Iida's theme.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpbkiaScRuM">"Kimi no Chikara"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> ("Your Power"), Todoroki's theme.</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYkYuei_n_0">"Hero-goroshi"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> ("Hero Killer"), Stain's theme.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a>: According to the light novels, Yaoyorozu's mother.

The most egregious examples include:<ul><li> When he first meets All Might, Midoriya asks if it was the villain Venomous Chainsaw who crippled him. All Might's response in the fan translation is, "Yeah, he wounded me but I wouldn't let that stop me." When Viz translated it, it came out as, "That lowlife? He could never do this to me."</li><li> Viz refers to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> of the League of Villains by his original Japanese name, "Kurogiri", whereas fans have been translating his name literally as "Black Mist".</li><li> Uraraka's recognition of her feelings for Midoriya is handled differently. In the fan translations, she apparently resolves to push her feelings aside entirely, whereas in the official translation, she wants to merely get them under control.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Hero Killer</a> Stain has different motivations depending on the translator. According to the fan translators, it's "The word 'hero' must be restored!" or "If heroes aren't restored...!". However, when Viz translated it, it was "If I don't reclaim my hero status...!"</li><li> While discussing why All Might no longer works with Sir Nighteye, fan translations had All Might explain it as, "We broke up, so it's kind of awkward", whereas the Viz translation is, "For certain reasons, it's awkward."</li><li> Regarding Endeavor's use of <em>niisanra</em>; both Viz and the scanlators made the mistake of assuming that he meant Todoroki had "older brothers" when in reality Endeavor was simply saying the latter had "older siblings."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note56ndu');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note56ndu" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note56ndu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In Japanese, it's typical to group people together under one category/majority regardless of gender.</span> A clue-in to this a few chapters later is during a flashback wherein Todoroki watches children playing outside, assumed to be his siblings, and one of them is wearing a skirt. Several chapters later, that sibling turns out to be Fuyumi, his sister.</li><li> In the dub for the anime and fan and official translations of the manga, both meanings of Deku are lost, since they both involve readings of Japanese characters, which they presumably couldn't explain for non-Japanese viewers in the timeframe given. The dub fixes this by having Bakugo call Midoriya "Deku" as a shorthand for "Defenseless Izuku", while making Uraraka like the name "Deku" just because it sounds heroic and cute.</li><li> Bakugo's two prospective hero names, King Explosion Murder and Lord Explosion Murder, are actually examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StevenUlyssesPerhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StevenUlyssesPerhero">Steven Ulysses Perhero</a> (being Bakusatsuou and Bakusatsuga, respectively, in the sub). Since the puns were untranslatable, the names were just literally translated.</li><li> When Shigaraki and Kurogiri refer to the mysterious voice on the computer as "Sensei"; almost everyone assumed that this was meant as "Teacher" or "Master", a.k.a. towards their boss and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a>. Later, it's established that it was actually "Sensei", as in "Doctor".</li><li> The official localization of the manga has to explain why "Naito" comes immediately before a couple names that start with "T" on the provisional exam results, as well as the point of the panel- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Todoroki didn't pass the exam</span>.</li><li> The English dub uses "Quirk genes" instead of "Quirk factor." In the episode the term is introduced, this isn't a big deal, but it later becomes apparent that the term refers to the physical factors that make Quirks work (such as Bakugo's sweat glands) rather than any genetic cause.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsAWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsAWeakness">Love Is a Weakness</a>:<ul><li> Gran Torino points out that Midoriya's idolization of All Might has warped his expectations of his hero and of the power of One For All, hindering his combat ability by making him think of his Quirk as merely a Special or even a Finishing Move.</li><li> Uraraka's feelings for Midoriya start developing in earnest after the first internship, but the topic terribly flusters her and even affects her field performance, so, not long after U.A. becomes a boarding school, she resolves to get a handle on them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPants">Magic Pants</a>: Zigzagged. Quirks involving transformation don't generally affect the character's clothes, as seen with Mt. Lady's supersizing power, or All Might's hero costume, which seems to magically appear and disappear as appropriate. This is justified in some cases because of Support Companies, which create high-tech hero costumes that can handle their users' Quirks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Though, for some reason</a>, this is subverted for other characters, such as Yaoyorozu, whose "generate objects out of her body" Quirk frequently leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a> and/or partial undressing, and Mirio, whose phasing ability frequently causes his gym uniform, but not his hero costume, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullFrontalAssault">fall off</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineLinesFeminineCurves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineLinesFeminineCurves">Masculine Lines, Feminine Curves</a>: There is a trend of the male characters being drawn with more defined muscles, sharp lines, and squares (e.g., Iida, All Might) and the female characters being drawn with rounder features and curves (e.g., Uraraka, Midnight). However, this is not totally ubiquitous; there are male characters who fall somewhere in the middle (e.g., Midoriya, who has round features but a muscular body) or avert it outright (e.g., Mineta, whose most notable physical feature is the round growths on his head), as well as female characters who have more jagged, angular designs (e.g., Jiro).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassOhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassOhCrap">Mass "Oh, Crap!"</a>: This is Midoriya, Iida, Todoroki, Yaoyorozu, and Kirishima's reaction when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they see All For One for the first time</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassSuperEmpoweringEvent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassSuperEmpoweringEvent">Mass Super-Empowering Event</a>: There was such an event in the series' history, causing most of humanity to develop "Quirks" as a result. At the time of the story proper, about four out of every five people have a Quirk, and the percentage of people with Quirks is increasing with each generation. It's also possible for non-human animals to have Quirks, but this is seemingly much rarer. However, it's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">Superpower Lottery</a> in that many Quirks aren't particularly useful, such as the ability to stretch one's eyes out of one's head really far. Most of the time, a person's Quirk is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">a variation on one of their parents' Quirks or both of them mixed together in some way</a>.

He's <em>so</em> enraged, in fact, that he has to be bound and gagged in order to make him stay on the podium during the award ceremony. When All Might tries to <em>put</em> the medal around his neck, however, Bakugo resists by budging his nose against and then <em>biting into</em> the medal ribbon so it won't go around his neck.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a>: The kid who shouts at the reporter during the live news coverage of High End's attack to stop broadcasting despair and asks if they can't see that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Endeavor is struggling to protect the civilians</span> becomes an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> instant meme after the incident.

A lot of their personalities fall under the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">bubbly, friendly, nice girl</a> trope or the "Strong Female Character" stereotype, whereas their male colleagues are given deeper, more complex characterizations and are actively involved in the story. It also doesn't help that the girls are significantly outnumbered in the student, pro hero, and villain groups:<ul><li> Uraraka is the main female lead of the series, yet 95% of her screentime is spent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesNotMyBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesNotMyBoyfriend">being reminded by others and feeling embarrassed about her feelings</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Midoriya</a>.

This is compounded by the fact that Midoriya, by virtue of being the male lead, has so many conflicts and character arcs which give him a more fleshed out identity that most fans can only recognize Uraraka as "Midoriya's love interest".</li><li> Nejire is the only female member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Big Three</a> at U.A.

They often undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">Clothing Damage</a> in combat. Mirio Togata is frequently seen naked, as using his Quirk causes his clothes to fall off, sans his specially made hero costume, revealing his very muscular physique.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>: A lot of the heroines wear either skintight bodysuits or skimpy, revealing outfits. Though these aren't exactly the most practical outfits for heroism, in a lot of cases, this is actually justified by the fact that several heroines, most notably Mt. Lady, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockHero">Punch Clock Heroes</a> constantly competing with each other for media attention and sponsorships in order to make money, and several of the heroines actively use their sex appeal to achieve this.

Among the most glaring examples, &#147;Esuha City&#148; stands in for Osaka (despite still being in Osaka Prefecture), and there is a &#147;Kamino Ward&#148; in Kanagawa Prefecture (with no mention of Yokohama, Kawasaki or Sagamihara, which would logically contain such a ward if it existed). Tokyo is a borderline case, with more general areas mentioned in passing but specific locations being entirely fictional.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a>: Downplayed.

Unbeknownst to him, All Might is standing right behind him, cursing his weakness that is preventing him from helping. Shortly after, Midoriya throws himself in harm's way to save Bakugo from the villain because he couldn't just stand there and watch him die. This statement hits All Might like a sledgehammer as that's what he's been doing and he immediately rushes in, powering through the pain of his injury to save both boys.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddNameOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddNameOut">Odd Name Out</a>: With respect to the series installments. The manga and the anime usually feature the title of the installment at the start, but in situations where some really heavy or intense events transpire, the title will appear at the <em>end</em> of the installment, usually for added dramatic impact and in situations where knowing the title early spoils something important.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6nqon');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note6nqon" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6nqon');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the manga only, as the anime gives a preview of every following episode and takes note that some viewers already know the source material.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">Offscreen Moment of Awesome</a>:<ul><li> A lot of the fights in the U.A.

Given the overwhelming difference in raw power, everyone in the audience tells him, "Don't worry about it!"

Most of the Nomus have multiple Quirks granted by the All For One bearer, but they're all mindless mutant clones, implying that it's dangerous or impossible to force several Quirks onto a normal human. Then there are the High-End Nomus which can hold more Quirks and retain some intelligence.

Although there are occasionally characters with similarly pronounced names, they all have different spellings:<ul><li> There are a villain and a police chief who both have names pronounced "Kenji", but the first uses the kanji for "health" and "magnet", whereas the second's name is written from the kanji for "dog" and "heir".</li><li> The series has Shota (Aizawa) and Shoto (Todoroki) and two distinct characters called Koda and Kota.</li><li> There are two "Kens" in the series: Takagi (Rock Lock) and Ishiyama (Cementoss).

Again, both are pro heroes.</li><li> Izuku's father "Hisashi" and U.A.'s own Present Mic, whose given name is "Hizashi".</li><li> There are two "Rikiyas", the first being the Shie Hassaikai's giant bruiser (Katsukame) and the second being the Meta Liberation Army's leader (Yotsubashi), both villains.</li><li> There are two "Toyas" in the series, the first being one of the Eight Bullets (Setsuno) and the second being Shoto's eldest brother (Todoroki).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>:<ul><li> Uraraka seeks to be a heroine just because it's a well-paying job. Although this would usually be portrayed as selfish and/or unethical, and she, herself, acknowledges how unwholesome this mindset is, she only wants the money to support her family; Iida reconstructs this by mentioning that there isn't anything wrong in looking for a well-paying job to sustain herself and her parents.</li><li> This is one of the many examples of "corruption" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">Hero Killer</a> Stain wants to excise from the world of heroics, leaving only those who want to be heroes for the sake of saving people. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">Ironically enough, Stain's idol, All Might, freely merchandises his own image</a>, as shown by the vast assortment of merchandise in Midoriya's room.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrganicTechnology">Organic Technology</a>: Several Quirks give their bearer technological components that clearly should not naturally be on humans, but are seemingly organic. For instance:<ul><li> Tenya's (and presumably the rest of the Iida family) Engine Quirk possesses radiators, mufflers, and exhaust pipes, are fueled by orange juice and clogged by sugar, and require regular maintenance. Also, at least some parts of this engine, such as mufflers, can be removed and regrow.</li><li> Jiro and her mother somehow have organic earphone jacks growing from their ears, which can be hardened for better sound quality but are already capable of penetrating solid concrete by the time the series begins.</li><li> Pretty much <em>anything</em> created by Yaoyorozu qualifies as this&mdash; she's capable of creating everything from cannons to ropes to sound systems from her own lipids.</li><li> There are several Quirks that allow for the manifestation or growth of metal on or from one's body&mdash; Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu's Steel, Moonfish's Bladetooth, and an unnamed criminal who injects himself with Trigger can generate metallic blades from his body.</li><li> A Quirk simply called "Rivet", which causes Rivets to grow on one's skin, is possessed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All For One</span>.</li><li> A preschooler in the Remedial Course Arc has a Quirk called "Tongue Tank", which lets him grow a cannon from his mouth.</li><li> Togaru Kamakiri of Class 1-B can protrude large razor blades from any part of his body.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginsEpisode">Origins Episode</a>: Chapter 59 explains the origin of One For All.

Quite a few Quirks result in people having monstrous forms or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly">animalistic traits</a>. This radically changed the definition of what it meant to be "human", leading to a period of unrest and strife as people struggled to figure out what to do about Quirks.

As a result, Iida is forced to come to terms with his own selfish and unheroic behavior.</li><li> Chapter 112 is called "What the Hell Are You Doing", and the title is quoted verbatim by Midoriya when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Todoroki and Yoarashi can't stop arguing long enough to defeat Gang Orca during the provisional exam, and have managed to put another examinee in danger.</span> They snap out of it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">When All You Have Is a Hammer...</a>:<ul><li> All Might's fighting ability essentially amounts to punching things really, really hard. Even when the villains create the first Nomu with the abilities of shock-absorption and regeneration as a hard counter to his physical strength, All Might eventually figures that since Nomu's power is to <em>absorb</em> shocks, not <em>nullify</em> them, all he has to do is keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">spamming punches</a>, harder and harder, until he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">goes beyond</a> the limits of Nomu's ability. Once he does, he promptly punts Nomu into the stratosphere.</li><li> Midoriya also suffers from this for a while, partly because he's still working out how to use his power after inheriting it from All Might, and partly because he's hung up on imitating All Might, whom he idolizes. For the first two-and-a-half series, his fighting style consists entirely of full-power punches and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerPokeOfDoom">Finger Pokes of Doom</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">break his bones from recoil</a>. By the time he develops a fighting style of his own that makes better use of his legs, it's practically out of necessity, because his arms are already heavily scarred and any further breaks could cripple him for life.</li><li> This is a recurring theme in the series. Students with powerful, combat-oriented powers tend to develop very narrow combat strategies, which characters like Stain and Aizawa take advantage of by getting in close/nullifying their powers and taking them down with regular martial arts. It's for this reason that U.A. High School's teachers emphasize creativity with powers and taking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxingLessonsForSuperman">Boxing Lessons for Superman</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkoutFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkoutFanservice">Workout Fanservice</a>:<ul><li> At the end of Midoriya's training to condition himself enough to handle One For All, there's a long shot of him sweaty and shirtless with his new lean musculature as evidence of his efforts to get into U.A.</li><li> Particularly in the anime, during Season 2 episode 2, shows several of the characters working out, with Todoroki's being a particularly fanservicey one, since he wears only a muscle shirt to train.</li><li> Bakugo in the Season 2 opening has been considered this.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldLimitedToThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldLimitedToThePlot">World Limited to the Plot</a>: The story is set solely in the scope of Japan (extending to any villainous plot to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, or vaguely similar plots really translating to "Take Over/Destroy Japan"), the outside world is only very rarely alluded to (almost entirely in backstories at that), it's never indicated how the rest of the world manages Quirks, and how the events of the story exist on a global scale is never mentioned at all. Excluding non-canonical material, everything outside of Japan only seems to exist tangentially, and otherwise is ignored for the purpose of the general story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfHam">World of Ham</a>: The world of <em>My Hero Academia</em> is ridiculously intense in general:<ul><li> All Might very rarely acts <em>not</em> hammy, even when in his true form and vomiting blood all over the place.</li><li> At least 80% of Bakugo's dialogue consists of angry screaming, Iida sometimes vibrates himself like a cellphone out of pure eagerness, and Aoyama manages to be so over-the-top flamboyant that even the class's girls can correctly guess how gaudy his room is.</li><li> The Wild Wild Pussycats always employ an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssKickingPose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssKickingPose">Ass Kicking Pose</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheNameOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheNameOfTheMoon">In the Name of the Moon</a> motto whenever they introduce themselves.</li><li> Even the normally cool and rational Aizawa tends to start class by slamming open the classroom door.</li><li> Uraraka's parents greet her by running towards her like ferocious beasts, literally scaring her eyeballs out.</li><li> Midoriya and his mother tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OcularGushers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OcularGushers">cry literal rivers</a>.</li><li> Ashido can stop bullying with the power of breakdancing.</li><li> When asked about suggestions for what to for the upcoming cultural festival, Class 1-A replies with literally explosive enthusiasm.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath">Writers Cannot Do Math</a>:<ul><li> Being Quirkless is treated as rare enough that it has to be explained to people. As it's repeatedly stated that 80% of humanity now has some form of Quirk, however, the actual ratio of Quirkless individuals should be about one out of every five people - a minority, but hardly as rare as the series would otherwise seem to indicate. Justified a little bit by the fact that Quirklessness is getting rarer every generation, and the 80% statistic includes the whole population, so it's extremely unusual that someone Midoriya's age would be Quirkless. It's implied he's the only one in his whole school who is, so it's fair that people would be confused and need to get a little more explanation or take a few seconds to process it. Even All Might mentions that his own Quirklessness wasn't nearly as big of a social issue as Midoriya's, just because it was way more common in his generation than it is in the new one.</li><li> According to the teacher roster All Might reads at the end of Chapter 5, Aizawa is said to have expelled 154 students in his time as a U.A. teacher. According to <em>Vigilantes</em>, Aizawa has not been a teacher for more than four or five years, so with 40 students per year in the Hero Course, leading to about a total of 160-200, he probably would have expelled the vast majority of his students. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then it turns out that this is only "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">technically</a>" true. Chapter 254 reveals that although Aizawa <em>did</em> expel his students, it was only on paper as they later re-enrolled. At least one of his former students is even thankful to him because it helped them grow.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongContextMagic">Wrong Context Magic</a>: One For All is unique among Quirks in the setting.

It was created artificially when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villain All For One gave his brother a Quirk that stockpiles power and it combined with that brother's then-unknown ability to pass on his Quirk</span>. One For All is the only Quirk immune to All For One's power.
