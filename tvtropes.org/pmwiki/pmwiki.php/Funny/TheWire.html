There&#146;s a knock at the door, in the corner of the room, and Pete comes walking in, carrying this gorgeous sieve, silver bowl, hand-chased&#151;it was <strong>this</strong> big. <em>It&#146;s from the unions</em>, he says. So I think it&#146;s a present, something to commemorate my first day as mayor...he walks over, puts it on the desk; I look down at it...it&#146;s disgusting. I say, <em>What the hell is this?</em> he said, <em>What the hell&#146;s it look like?</em> I said, <em>it looks like shit&#151;what do you want me to do with it?</em> He says, <em>eat it</em>... <em>Eat it?</em> He says, <em>Yeah, you&#146;re the mayor. You gotta eat it</em>. So okay, it was my first day; Pete knows more than I do...So I go at it. And just when I finish, there&#146;s a knock on the door, and in walks Pete carrying another silver bowl. And this one from the blacks. <em>This too?</em> And he nods. I start eating, and when i&#146;m finished, there&#146;s another knock and another bowl. This one&#146;s from the Polacks. Then after that, one from the ministers... And you know what, Tommy? That&#146;s what it is. You&#146;re sitting eating shit all day long. Day after day, year after year.

Now get goin'." Then&#65279; he knocks on the door to Royce's office, and Royce shouts "Come in!" Herc pauses, not sure if he heard "Come in!" or "I'm coming!" not wanting a repeat of the past incident. So he knocks again, prompting Royce to shout "Are you coming in or what?!" So Herc says, "I'm coming in, okay?" and slowly opens the door.<ul><li> In spite of Valchek's words about how the blowjob will be the undiscussed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheRoom">Elephant in the Room</a>, Herc still manages to insert a faux pas during his brief explanation of why he took the mayoral detail:</li></ul></li></ul><div class="indent">"If I do good here, they'll reach down to me <em>[hand gesture pointing to his crotch area]</em>..."<ul><li> As predicted, Royce decides to call Burrell to get Herc promoted up.

He likely is not a college graduate, but feels nonetheless superior to those with advanced education. And he is likely employed in a bureaucratic entity, possibly civil service or quasi-public service, from which he feels alienated. He has a problem with authority and a deep-seated resentment of those who he feels have impeded his progress professionally. The minimized sexual activity suggests that this is not a primary motive for the killings. In fact, the bite marks on the last found victim - lacking the D.N.A. and saliva - indicate to us possible postmortem staging. The suspect has trouble with lasting relationships and is possibly a high-functioning alcoholic, with alcohol being utilized as a trigger in the commission of these crimes. His resentment of the homeless may stem from a personal relationship with someone who is in that cohort, or his victimization of vagrants might merely present an opportunity for him to assert his superiority and intellectual prowess."</div><ul><li> What makes it funnier is knowing that criminal profiling is seen by police as next to useless, barely a step above "psychics".
