It premiered at the Two River Theatre in Red Bank, New Jersey in 2015. It follows the life of Jeremy Heere, an average high school dork whose life gets turned upside down after he gets a Squip - a quantum supercomputer in the form of a pill that enters one's brain and instructs them on how to become cool.</p><p>Despite running for only a month in a small regional theater, it blew up in popularity on Tumblr in summer 2017 and has the makings of a modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultClassic">Cult Classic</a>. The fanbase is vocal enough to have secured it an Off-Broadway run starting in July 2018, and then a Broadway run from February to August of 2019.

The stage iteration of Jeremy doesn't do the latter two at all, and balances his nerdy horniness with his patience with his father's depression, genuine friendship with Michael, respect for Christine, and empathy and kindness towards his peers, despite his mistreatment at their hands. He's still plenty flawed, but this comes through more often than not as a result of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">SQUIP's influence</a> taking advantage of said flaws. He also <em>never</em> has the moment of not telling Michael about the SQUIP, going so far as to offer to share it with him. Jeremy is a lot gentler and less mean-spirited than his book counterpart, too.</li><li> Michael is also less sympathetic in general in the book considering he's a white boy with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowFever">Yellow Fever</a>. In the climax, he reveals to Jeremy that he lied about not knowing what the SQUIP was because he thought Jeremy shouldn't be taking it due to the users who got hospitalized.

Whereas in the book he is straight and his girlfriend Nicole is a minor character, in the play it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">ambiguous</a> as to what his preferences are and he remains single throughout.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>: While Jeremy's Squip could certainly be cruel in the book, the musical version is outright abusive towards Jeremy, degrading his self-esteem with mantras like "Everything about you is just terrible/Everything about you makes me wanna die" so that Jeremy will be compelled to do what it says. Jeremy's Squip isn't even an antagonist in the book. Sure, it can definitely be snarky and it and mistakenly humiliates Jeremy in front of a crowd full of onlookers, but it never sets out to brainwash all of humanity and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">even tells Jeremy how to deactivate it once it realizes it will be no further help to him.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: There are only three human adult characters in the whole show: The Stockboy (drug dealer), Mr. Reyes (drama teacher who doesn't care about his job at all and mocks his own students), and Jeremy's dad (depressed man who is too consumed by his divorce to take care of Jeremy. He gets better by the end, though). Even the unseen parent characters are more often than not implied to be abusive or at least unhelpful, with the exception of Michael's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">loving moms</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: Mr. Heere freaks out when he learns that Jeremy "borrowed" his car to go to a Halloween party, where one of the guests set a fire. He confronts Jeremy about it, and realizes his son his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHimself">Not Himself</a>. In the end of the play, after Jeremy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ends up in the hospital, Mr. Heere expresses his relief by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded">You Are Grounded</a> and he's going to be a better parent</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIGettingHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIGettingHigh">A.I.

Is a Crapshoot</a>: The SQUIP is supposed to help its user deal with social situations in a more appropriate fashion... and instead it emotionally and physically abuses the user. Within the show specifically, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rich's SQUIP represses his feelings for boys and leads to him burning down Jake's house, and Jeremy's SQUIP (possibly in league with Rich's SQUIP), tries to take over the entire school, and details its plans to erase all human emotion from existence.

Everyone <em>assumes</em> this is the case when Rich sets a fire at the Halloween party, but the story gets even juicer when they find out he was sober when he did it.

Will Roland has also <a class="urllink" href="https://gothammag.com/dear-evan-hansen-will-roland-broadway">cited<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> his experience working with children with social disorders like Asperger's autism as inspiration for how he portrays Jeremy.</li></ul></li><li> In addition to his geeky interests and obsession with vintage products such as soda (highly specific interests being a hallmark trait of autism), Michael also shows signs of anxiety&mdash;he has a full-blown panic attack at the Halloween party, in the process also showing symptoms of serious social anxiety and suicidal ideation. It's ambiguous how much of this is a new thing due to losing his only friend, and how much of it was there before but just well-hidden.</li><li> While some of Rich's shaky sanity is the result of abuse by his SQUIP rather than a disorder, he does briefly mention that he first <em>got</em> his SQUIP partially because he was "stagnant" and "suicidal" - which his SQUIP clearly exploits. On Halloween, when he struggles to find a way to get rid of the SQUIP, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> attempts suicide</span>.</li><li> Christine feels unable to relate to anyone her age outside of theatre, mirroring how some autistic people or people with ADHD can feel about people who do not share their interests. She also mentions frequently feeling depressed and immediately follows it up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">suspiciously flustered</a> insistence that she doesn't self-harm, she seems to lack a filter when she speaks, and she has an odd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a> of being the only character in the musical whose songs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedRhymeEveryOccasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedRhymeEveryOccasion">don't always rhyme</a>, which is probably a metaphor for <em>something</em>. The "ambiguous" part of the trope is downplayed with her, though, since she directly describes herself as having ADD.</li><li> Since his divorce, Jeremy's dad never leaves the house or even bothers to get dressed until his concern for Jeremy forced him to. He seems to be suffering from pretty serious depression, but the show doesn't really go into it much.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>: Never confirmed, explicitly or otherwise, but it's hard to look at Michael and miss the optics. He spends most of the musical pining after Jeremy, and treats their strained relationship like a bad breakup, mourning not being half of a pair anymore. Jeremy calls Michael his "favorite person", and his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> betrayal of Michael at the end of the first act is the largest turning point in the musical</span>, not to mention the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Michael is the only one who is able to save him from the Squip</span>. This is a change from Vizzini's novel: there, Michael has a girlfriend named Nicole, who is a minor character.<ul><li> According to <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

In the 2018 production, she has secondhand trauma from the Halloween party, giving Jeremy a tearful, angry speech about how heartbroken and horrified she is by Rich almost dying and the fallout of him burning down Jake's house, how guilty and miserable she feels over laughing at Rich's behaviour and how she's at a loss as to how help her many, many suffering classmates.</li><li> Rich has a very rough home life with an alcoholic father and is mentioned to have been suicidal in freshman year, where he was such a loser even Jeremy and Michael didn't notice him. His Squip only made his life worse, likely treating him just as badly as Jeremy's Squip, hiding his lisp, true personality, and bisexuality, shocking him repeatedly and ultimately driving him to burn down his friend's house in an effort to stop it, leaving him hospitalized and severely burned.

At the Halloween party, the Squip forces Jeremy into a sexual situation with Chloe, using its control over his body to stop him from escaping and to puppet him so that he reciprocates her advances. Jeremy explicitly states that he doesn't want to have sex with Chloe and is very uncomfortable kissing her, telling the Squip multiple times that he wants to stop and eventually pleading with it for help while it looks on in cruel amusement. It is never brought up or even referenced again, but Jeremy is noticeably upset by it, running from the room in a shaky panic as soon as the Squip shuts down, although that could be just as much from Jake threatening him. What's more, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Brooke is mad that the guy she's dating was kissing her best friend, she rightly blames Chloe more than she blames Jeremy because a friend is supposed to be more loyal</span>.</li><li> Towards the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Christine confesses her love for Jeremy... while under the influence of the Squip.

Fortunately, Jeremy has his head on right and realizes Christine doesn't really have control over what she's saying or doing, and he's far too good a guy to take advantage. The implications are still pretty horrific, especially if you consider what may have happened if someone less noble was in Jeremy's shoes.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheElevenOClockNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheElevenOClockNumber">The Eleven O'Clock Number</a>: "The Pants Song", coming, surprisingly, from Mr. Heere as he resolves both his and Michael's arc, pushing past his depression to enlist his help in saving Jeremy.<ul><li> "The Pitiful Children" qualifies as a villainous one, a huge and menacing ensemble piece led by the Squip as it truly unfurls its plan. During the number, Jeremy is brought the deepest yet into the villain's clutches, as is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jenna Rolan</span>, while the Squip gloats over its impending victory, all of which sets up some serious threats for the climax.

When she expresses interest in Jake, it's because Jake complimented her acting and said she was talented at it. Jeremy laments how he isn't cool enough to win her over, instead of realizing that Christine wants someone who appreciates her for who she is. He is also insensitive enough to ask her out after Jake dumps her at the Halloween party, with Christine saying she's not ready to do that until she finds out who she is without Jake.

The strongest contender for this trope is easily "The Smartphone Hour", however, where the students spread malicious gossip over social media after a classmate <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">driven insane by his SQUIP's torture after he resisted its plans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a></span> set fire to his best friend's house, burning it to the ground and nearly dying in the process, while his best friend broke both his legs escaping out of a top-floor window. This is obviously intentional, however, as the song is satirizing how irreverent and glib young people are in the face of tragedy, often exploiting it for online social clout.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a>: The Squip, and how. Right from the start it begins chipping away at Jeremy's already bruised self-esteem with constant, often unnecessarily harsh critiques of his looks, personality, and mannerisms. Then it asserts that all these things can be fixed and Jeremy can become cool if he only listens to its advice. He reinforces all this by alternately offering and then withholding scraps of affection and support which Jeremy feels he's lacking, especially from adult role model figures, which the SQUIP explicitly resembles. When Jeremy starts to have doubts about ditching Michael for the popular kids, the Squip contends that he's a link to "Jeremy 1.0" and that if Jeremy ever wants to become popular he'll have to ditch losers like Michael. The manipulative part is somewhat expected since the Squip supposedly has a comprehensive, adaptable knowledge of human social conventions and the ability to predict the most likely outcome of anything that anyone could say or do, but it certainly plays up the bastard aspect of this throughout the musical. It also issues electric shocks whenever he disobeys it, and is capable of producing hallucinations that 'prove' its points (such as of a crowd at the mall that alternately berates and adores Jeremy). This reaches its head perhaps during "The Pitiful Children", when the SQUIP <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shows a deeply empathetic Jeremy how Jenna Rolan and Christine suffer similarly to him, and contrasts this with how happy Jenna becomes when they give her a SQUIP of her own; by promising that they're helping others not suffer the way he did, the SQUIP gets Jeremy to agree to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> by creating a SQUIP hivemind in which every person has no choice but to be happy</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerEnsembleNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveMultiplayerEnsembleNumber">Massive Multiplayer Ensemble Number</a>: At least half of the songs in the show count as this: "More Than Survive", "Upgrade", "Halloween", "The Smartphone Hour (Rich Set a Fire)", "The Play", and "Voices in My Head".

It bluntly says that there are dozens of girls that are easier to attain and who would be interested in Jeremy of their own volition. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jeremy doesn't realize the Squip is right until much later when Brooke calls out Jeremy for breaking her heart even though ironically enough he didn't want anything to do with Chloe</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSong">Villain Song</a>: "The Pitiful Children" and "Be More Chill" (Parts 1 and 2). Both are sung by the Squip to Jeremy, the title songs establishing it as an abusive and manipulative presence, and "The Pitiful Children" detailing its plans to Squip the whole school, and eventually, the world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFaceHold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFaceHold">Villainous Face Hold</a>: The Squip is a huge fan of this. He grabs Jeremy's chin to appraise what parts of him he wants to improve next, to get his attention, or to leer about his plans and the futility of putting up a fight.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualInnuendo">Visual Innuendo</a>: Brooke makes some...interesting gestures towards Jeremy with her straw and soda can during "Do You Wanna Ride?".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Weirdness Censor</a>: Most of the popular kids at the end think that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they were drugged with Ecstasy at the school play rather than brainwashed by a supercomputer</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: Some of the Squip's lyrics in "The Pitiful Children" present it as this, though whether the Squip means a word of it or if it's just manipulating Jeremy (or both) depends on the audience's interpretation. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewEraSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewEraSpeech">New Era Speech</a> during later versions of "The Play" certainly seems to play into this interpretation, as its programming relies on making people happy. Again, how much this means when its idea of happiness is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">skewed</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">say</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeSciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardRapeSciFi">least</a>, as well as its need for total control, is up to the audience to decide.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: Pretty much all of Jeremy's Squip-influenced actions. When Jeremy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">abandons Michael at the end of the first act in favor of being popular</span> is a big one, but equally, using Brooke (who is genuinely attracted to him) to eventually get to Christine, blowing up at his father, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> going along with the Squip's hivemind plan at first</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">Downplayed</a> in that much of what he does is a result of extensive manipulation, and quite notably, he snaps out of it when Christine calls him out. He seems pretty self-aware throughout, too, and frequently struggles with the morality of his actions.<div class="indent"><strong>Jeremy:</strong> How could <em>all</em> this happen? I didn&#146;t mean to hurt Brooke, I didn&#146;t mean to hurt anyone! Now Rich is in the hospital, my best friend thinks I&#146;m a jerk! And Christine &#150; you were supposed to make her like me! You were supposed to <em>fix</em> me, and I&#146;ve done everything you said, and all <em>it's</em> done is make things worse. For everyone!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: Michael drops two when he confronts Jeremy about the SQUIP at the Halloween party.<div class="indent"><strong>Michael:</strong> I started asking around. Finally, this guy I play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">Warcraft</a> with told me his brother went from a straight D student to a freshman at Harvard. You know where he is now? <br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Really happy and successful? <br><strong>Michael:</strong> He&#146;s in a <em>mental hospital</em>. <br>(&#133;) <br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> If you&#146;re telling me that his SQUIP made him crazy&#133; <br><strong>Michael:</strong> His SQUIP didn&#146;t make him crazy! <br><strong>Jeremy:</strong> Alright, well there you go! <br><strong>Michael:</strong> <em>HE WENT CRAZY TRYING TO <strong>GET IT OUT</strong>!</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidYouMakeMeHitYou">Why Did You Make Me Hit You?</a>: The Squip at its most manipulative does this repeatedly during "The Pitiful Children" and "The Play", citing Jeremy's desires as the source of his villainous actions multiple times. While this is pretty blatant victim blaming consistent with the Squip's severe abuse of Jeremy, the nature of its programming adds a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainHasAPoint">horrifying grain of truth</a> to the assertions. In the Broadway Production, the Squip says this pretty much verbatim as it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> forces Jake to walk on his broken legs, puppeteering him</span> to subdue Jeremy and Michael.<div class="indent"> <strong>The Squip:</strong> <em>(scolding but smug)</em> Oh, Jeremy... <em>look</em> what you're making me make him do!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">Wild Teen Party</a>: Halloween. There are girls in revealing costumes, massive amounts of alcohol, jello shots, pot, sex, and by the end <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the house is set on fire</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreWorthHell">You Are Worth Hell</a>: Jeremy would rather <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">free Christine from the SQUIP and let the computer torture him forever, rather than save himself</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToHaveJews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveToHaveJews">You Have to Have Jews</a>: After he first swallows the Squip and nothing immediate happens, Jeremy mourns to Michael that he "blew [his] bar mitzvah money on a Wintergreen Tic-tac."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous">You're Just Jealous</a>: Jeremy says this at the Halloween party when Michael warns him that several people ended up in the hospital after using a Squip. No, it's not the Squip telling him that; it shut down after Jeremy had a drink, so this is really him talking. Michael is left to cry in the bathroom. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">No, Michael was never jealous of his best friend</span>.</li></ul><hr><div class="indent"><em>"There's still voices in my head, but now they're just the normal kind."</em></div>
