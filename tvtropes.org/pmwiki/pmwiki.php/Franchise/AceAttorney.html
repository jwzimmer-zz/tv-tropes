Maggey Byrde's name is a pun based on a magpie, thought to be a very unlucky bird. Furio Tigre isn't just named for an angry, powerful tiger; he has one on his shirt and roars when he's upset. The Kitaki mafia family has trickster foxes on their clothing, and Wocky's hair makes him look like a fox. Alita Tiala has bird wings on her dress to help her look sweeter. Daryan Crescend's hair and jacket are reminiscent of a vicious shark. Phoenix's name is a reference to his trials ability to, essentially, come back from the dead.<ul><li> Not surprisingly, some of these characters have the same puns in their Japanese names. Furio Tigre's surname "Toranosuke" literally means Tiger boy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerVersusDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TigerVersusDragon">The tiger devouring a dragon</a> on his shirt is actually a reference to Phoenix that is lost in translation, because Phoenix's name in Japan is "Ryuichi" and is spelled with the kanji for "dragon." "Ryuichi" isn't supposed to have any meaning at all, but the writers chose to play around with it in the third game anyway when they make his "evil twin". The English release gave the main character's name meaning anyway, via Woolseyism. Same for Maggey Byrde, whose name has no animal references in Japanese (but literally means "continues to lose").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeHair">Anime Hair</a>: Nearly everyone has some improbable hairstyle. Phoenix's and Apollo's hair spikes are constantly lampshaded, but there's also Athena's ridiculously long side ponytail, Pearl's pretzel hairstyle, Klavier and Kristoph's drill-like ponytails, Daryan's...torpedo... pompadour thing. Lampshaded in "Turnabout Revolution," where Edgeworth fears that "weird hairstyles" will end up being associated with Americans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Arc Words</a>: "X years ago" is a common one. In the first game's second and fourth cases, it's "15 years ago." In case 1-5, it's "2 years ago" to the point of being lampshaded (and to a lesser extent, "6 months ago"). In Apollo Justice, it's "7 years ago." The third game has a bunch of them, but "5 years ago" is probably the most common.<ul><li> In Dual Destinies the words <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Dark age of the law"</span> are said so many times some characters comment on it.

The issue is that the view of <em>when</em> the truth should be brought to light expressed through the events of the game is a nuanced one, while the view expressed through the dialogue is an absolute one. Edgeworth's dialogue after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a> could be summarized as "expose the truth, no matter how painful." Yet there are situations in which players are supposed to hate someone for exposing the truth.<ul><li> An example where revealing the truth is praised: telling a man who already knows that he was deceived by his girlfriend five years ago exactly <em>how</em> he was deceived? Sure, the truth turned out to be that he hadn't been as bad a judge of character as he thought he was, but Edgeworth starts pushing for the Truth to come out without knowing what it is. Edgeworth inherently knows that The Truth will heal the man's pain even if it gives him more to be upset about.</li><li> Situations in which revealing the truth is condemned:<ul><li> Telling a jealous man the truth about his fiance's ex in order to make him reconsider the marriage? How evil! (The timing of the reveal is implied to have been part of what made it evil, but the heroes don't exactly tread lightly when it comes to the timing of big reveals either.)</li><li> This is Matt Engarde. And he didn't expose his past with Celeste to Juan for any reason other than to cause more pain. He didn't love Celeste, and Celeste <em>never</em> did anything to hurt anybody, but he told Juan because he knew his rival would <em>never</em> marry Celeste because of it. Sure enough, Celeste commits suicide over it and both men use her death as just another means to hurt each other. <em>That's</em> why what Matt did was evil, and even worse he used an assassin in the most abusive sense of the word.</li><li> Telling a skeptical public about a very unconventional technique the police used to solve a case, that lead them astray? Or publicizing a politician's affair with a secretary? The work of an evil man who caused nothing but pain. (The truth was definitely not the culprit's motive, but revealing the truth about what the police did was an effect nevertheless.)</li></ul></li><li> Situations in which exposing the truth was portrayed in a mixed light:<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth</a></em>, it is clear that the Yatagarasu's tendency to "steal evidence of corrupt dealings of all kinds" and send it to the press is illegal and that Edgeworth would like to be above such actions, but the Yatagarasu's actions in this regard are hardly portrayed as evil. The Yatagarasu was just "stealing the Truth" in order to bring it to light.</li><li> At one point, Edgeworth threatens to publicize a witness' embarrassing psychological diagnosis unless that witness testifies truthfully. He says that it's not his problem if the witness chooses to commit suicide in response to the psychological profile being publicized.</li><li> Edgeworth played a similar card when it came down to accusing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Athena Cykes of killing her mother when she was 11</span>. The circumstances of the murder were particularly disturbing and grisly given who the suspect was and it was enough to get the judge and Phoenix to try and plead with him not to say it, be it the truth or otherwise. Simon Blackquill's reaction to having his testimony about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the UR-1 incident</span> dissected and undone has a similar effect (the truth is there but it is far worse than what was hiding it).</li><li> Revealing who the killer is, even when there's already enough evidence to prove the defendant didn't do it, and the killer is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">in some ways a decent person who had a compelling reason for what they did</a> and will now likely get in huge trouble? Mia says it's justice (though Maya didn't seem to agree and it's unclear whether Phoenix was fully convinced). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Godot, at least, seemed to WANT to be brought to justice, and in fact subtly encouraged Phoenix to put the nail in the coffin, so to speak.</span></li><li> In the above case, the judge has explicitly stated that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only Maya or Godot could be the killer. Maya knows that Godot had acted in order to save her and is thus protecting him at all costs; however, Phoenix is just as determined to protect Maya, so he has really no choice but to expose Godot. And as stated in the spoiler above, Godot did subtly encourage Phoenix to prove him as the killer</span>.</li></ul></li><li> A case could be made that revealing the truth really was good in the situations where it was portrayed as good and bad in the situations in which it was portrayed as bad, but the dialogue describes bringing The Truth to light as though it is a golden ideal that is always good - as long as the person doing it is a good guy, and the person whose truth got exposed only considers committing suicide rather than actually doing so.</li><li> All in all it seems the games have the aesop of "bringing the truth to light is a good thing", especially when done to help others, but also point out that in some contexts doing so can cause more harm than good, especially if the motives for doing so aren't really pious, and that the matter isn't quite black and white.</li><li> On top of that, while revealing the truth tends to ultimately be for the best, it's shown that sometimes you actually need discretion regarding when to reveal things, otherwise you have the potential to make things worse. A discretion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Miles Edgeworth</a> never seems to master, however it could be said that he's very blunt because he knows that Phoenix can turn it back around on a dime.</li><li> Also, revealing the truth when it comes to your own emotions and feelings is not exactly welcome, seeing how much the Japanese love <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">The Stoic</a>.

No development here either except for resident detective Gumshoe.</li><li> <em>Apollo Justice</em> varies it a bit with Case 2: "Turnabout Corner", which, despite introducing the rest of the game's major characters, hardly advances the game's overarching background or plot, being more of a compilation of silly subplots involving panties and noodles that eventually converge into a murder.</li><li> <em>Dual Destinies</em> has the Case 2 again, the "Monstrous Turnabout", which features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a> as its main gimmick.

(By the final case of T&amp;T, it's mentioned that Gumshoe cannot pay his electric bill, and cried of joy when Edgeworth gave him pasta with extra cheese.) Same thing happened with his clueless traits. By the time the <em>Investigations</em> games came around, Gumshoe's main character traits were: he's dumb, and he lives on instant noodles. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He finally gets a break at the end of Investigations 2</span>.</li><li> The Judge progressively becomes more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">airheaded</a>; this is most noticeable between Turnabout Goodbyes and Rise from the Ashes, as latter was written after T&amp;T.

Also, Gumshoe asks if he can work as Wright and Co. after he is fired foreshadowing him working for Phoenix in the last case in <em>Justice for All</em>. The climax of the case in which Phoenix is accused of withholding evidence could be foreshadowing <em>Apollo Justice</em>.<ul><li> Also in the second case of <em>Trials and Tribulations</em>, when talking about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanThief">Mask DeMasque</a> Phoenix says that when you're famous there are always imitators.

It's a flashback to four years before the first game and six months before Edgeworth's first trial, and contains multiple references to future events. If you hadn't played the first few games you wouldn't get the meaning behind von Karma's comments (he killed Edgeworth's father), the fire extinguisher being used in a crime (later used to bash Phoenix on the head and give him temporary amnesia), Franziska mentioning she wouldn't know what to do were her father to die (it is implied in JFA that Manfred dies after being convicted on the murder of Gregory Edgeworth) and saying she would never have to work with Detective Gumshoe or Edgeworth mentioning his badge won't stay shiny forever (his reputation will eventually be tarnished)</span>.</li><li> In case five, the 'shadow of the Yatagarasu' is formed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">more than one statue</span>. This foreshadows the fact that the real Yatagarasu <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is more than one person</span>.</li><li> In case 3 of the first game, Phoenix makes a somewhat overly-dramatic comment to Cody Hackins, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Steel Samurai</a> fanboy, that seeing through lies is "one of his powers". Fast-forward to case 2 of the second game, when Phoenix is given a Magatama, which <em>literally</em> gives him the power to see through lies, via Psyche Locks.</li><li> In the bonus case of the first game, 'Rise from the Ashes', when accused of forging evidence, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Damon Gant</span> points out that although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edgeworth</span> may have been found to have unknowingly presented forged evidence, says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"It's not just prosecutors who can forge evidence, right Wrighto?" Fast forward to Apollo Justice...</span>.<ul><li> During 3-3, Phoenix thinks to himself that a "phony case" is "the perfect excuse for some phony evidence".

Fast forward to AAI, and meet Quercus Alba, a criminal who can't be touched by the law due to his diplomatic immunity</span>. Then there's the fact that all the evidence and testimony in the world couldn't touch the killer of the IS-7 Incident because of the Statute of Limitations running out no matter what way the case is looked at. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except one, but even then, the killer is implied to get off scot-free, even though the one who took the fall was released from prison</span>.</li><li> And that isn't just in the case of Edgeworth as Phoenix Wright himself does it. His monologue at the end of the game talks about not being able to change past mistakes, only make up for them and then move on. What does Nick do in Apollo Justice? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He accidentally presents forged evidence in court, and pays for it, then spends seven years making up for that mistake, raising Trucy, and finding out what really happened in the case that caused him to lose his badge.

The rest of the prologue focuses on the murder of this case, but it is drawn in the style of a painted picture. We finally get to meet the painter in case 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and we find out that they've created paintings of all of Apollo's cases.</span> Also, in a rare soundtrack example, the music in the painter's studio is a remix of the music that plays over the opening scene.</li><li> Larry's artistic skills are foreshadowed from the very beginning, since he made the Thinker clocks that factored into the first two cases.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Godot also does this in case 3-3, when he doesn't <em>notice</em> the Apron covered in blood, but he does notice the coffee.

This allows him to discover if a person is really guilty almost instantly. As for Apollo and Athena, they both have their own powers that allow them to discover lies from clients.

At least the heroes have the decency to lampshade this one. In addition, the other prosecutor is one victim's wife, the other victim's sister, and the reigning monarch of the country, and actively abuses her power to make life miserable for the defense. This at least has some justification as said prosecutor can change the rules of how the law works as she sees fit.</li></ul></li><li> Police investigations rarely last more than a single afternoon, often resulting in glaring and obvious pieces of evidence being overlooked. They also don't look into any additional suspects in crimes after arresting the first one. Furthermore, the DA's office is shown to be directly superior to the police department, with prosecutors having enough influence to decrease officers' pay, have them demoted and even have them fired. This conflict of interest means that officers and detectives care more about pleasing prosecutors than seeing justice served.</li><li> A glaring issue is that even if Phoenix can prove without the shadow of a doubt that his client is innocent, and the judge can agree with this, the case almost always won't end until he finds (and proves the guilt of) the murderer. 1-3 in particular showcases this. Phoenix proves his client cannot have committed the crime by day 2, with the Judge agreeing this is the case, but the trial stretches for a third day with the judge specifically charging Phoenix with unearthing the guilty party. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AwkwardZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/AwkwardZombie">Awkward Zombie</a></em> parodies this in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.awkwardzombie.com/comic/guilty-until-proven-guilty">a comic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

It's <em>not enough</em> to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant is innocent. There is at least one point in the games (probably more) where it is actually possible to have the defendant found guilty despite the Judge acknowledging that you've already proved their innocence. It's not even enough to prove who else <em>did</em> commit the crime. To get the defendant acquitted, you have to identify the real criminal and <em>make them confess on the stand.</em> In addition, eyewitness testimony, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> considered to be the least reliable form of evidence, is in this series considered, on its own, to be grounds to convict somebody as long as what they said is <em>physically possible</em>, even if you've already established that they're incredibly shady people whose honesty and/or impartiality are highly questionable.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note70aj1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note70aj1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note70aj1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the best example of this, take case 1-1.

It has an inquisitive court system, where the goal is to find the truth. Even trial by jury was not established in the Japanese legal system until 2009&mdash;and even then only for certain severe crimes (and the arrangement has far more in common with a court-martial than a common law trial). Yeah, it seems mildly biased against the player, but that's simply a gameplay mechanism. The prosecutors tend to treat the inquisitive court system as an adversarial one, doing anything to get their guilty verdict. Phoenix is not corrupt, and tries to only defend clients he truly believes innocent. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> let the characters get away with murder (well, not literally, that's the one thing no one actually gets away with). When the judge believes there are loose ends, he will not give a verdict until the loose ends are tied up. So it's not guilty until proven innocent, except where it inconveniences the player.</li><li> Even most countries with the inquisitive system, including Japan, have the principle where one is "innocent until proven guilty." However, in a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, the Japanese court system has a &gt;99% conviction rate (though it has been attributed to limited funding leading to only the most solid cases being tried), forced confessions are allowed frequently, and prosecutors can appeal not-guilty verdicts. In 2008, the Justice Minister noted that the idea of "innocent until proven guilty" was one that he wanted to constrain. However, this game takes it even further than the broken system in Japan and makes it so that one is "guilty until someone <em>else</em> is proven guilty". <a class="urllink" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_253/7530-Phoenix-Wrights-Objection">More in this article.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> The trope becomes a plot point between the <em>Trials &amp; Tribulations</em> and <em>Apollo Justice</em> chapters in the series. Phoenix notices just how utterly broken and biased the court system is and how he would have lost several cases if something didn't turn the tide of the trial at the last minute. After Phoenix becomes disbarred from practicing law, this sets off a string of events. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In order to get Kristoph Gavin for evidence fraud and murder, Phoenix had to fight to get the court system to instate a jury system so that the fate of a client is decided by their peers rather than a single judge and he used Apollo as a catalyst for seeking out the truth during trials, something Phoenix was no longer able to do anymore legally.</span></li><li> And then between <em>Apollo Justice</em> and <em>Dual Destinies</em> comes the "Dark Age of Law", <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">where the justice system became SO corrupt that all the people lost their trust in the legal system, and the Jurist System was abandoned.

The greatest number of characters in any individual episode is 27 in The Grand Turnabout, many of whom are already dead. Most cases average around 10-15 characters, with tutorial cases having fewer. Further, each game typically only has one detective, one judge, and one or two major prosecutors/rival investigators, making Ace Attorney a rare example of a series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a> which employs an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EconomyCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EconomyCast">Economy Cast</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast">Minimalist Cast</a>.

Because spiritual channeling can only be used by women, Kurain Village is solely occupied by women and girls, with the powerless men and boys living outside the village in separation. Only the position of Kurain Master can only be held by the most powerful woman of the main family branch.

This is likely because in Sahwit's case, he committed <em>second-degree</em> murder (in other words, he killed his victim without any prior planning), not first-degree (premeditated) murder.

Depending on whether you have this costume equipped or not, Athena's formal introduction in the game in case takes on a different meaning. Apollo, who's introducing Athena in the narration, says "She might not look it, but at just 19 years old, she's a lawyer as well."

And when they're doing this, the prosecutor is going to be arguing to defend the person the defense is accusing, just like the defense was doing earlier in the trial before they could pinpoint an actual culprit. The only real distinction between defense attorneys and prosecutors in practice is that prosecutors always side with the results of the police investigation (and have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">much, much easier job</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberedSequels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberedSequels">Numbered Sequels</a>: Only in Japan, all the games simply go by their title plus a number (<em>Gyakuten Saiban</em>, <em>Gyakuten Saiban 2</em>, etc.).

It seems that they're the only ones to notice that the prosecution is blatantly lying/taking advantage of the Judge/doing something incredibly illegal/whipping people to let off steam/etc. This is a bit jarring in <em>Dual Destinies</em>, when the cases cycle between Apollo, Athena, and Phoenix as the playable characters and, from the perspective of each of them, the other two come across as very ridiculous.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrgyOfEvidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrgyOfEvidence">Orgy of Evidence</a>: This is how pretty much every trial begins. It's often lampshaded by Phoenix, Apollo, Mia, and Athena, who note that the massive amounts of evidence really do make a compelling case against their clients and that they must look past it to believe in them. Edgeworth also tends to lampshade this in the first game, when he presents his opening statements along the lines of, "We have a lot of evidence and eyewitnesses who saw the defendant do it. We have this in the bag." By the time the trial is over, of course, the defense team has proven that it all points to the real culprit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNervousFlopSweat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNervousFlopSweat">Overly Nervous Flop Sweat</a>: A lot of characters sweat bullets when they see themselves trapped into a corner, attorneys, witnesses, or otherwise.

The penalty meter represents how much patience the Judge has left, and when it runs out, he declares the trial over and done with. There are also several points where he demands evidence from the defense to back their claims, on the threat of ending the trial if they can't. (In one trial in <em>Apollo Justice</em>, he threatens to "throw the baby out with the bathwater" if Apollo can't <em>explain how a magic trick works</em>.

The goal is to cover the area where the fingerprint is on the screen with white powder, and then "blow" the powder away, but God help you if you miss even one miniscule section.

What's the difference? You need to stop judging things based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions, Nick! <br><strong>Phoenix</strong>: R-right... sorry.<ul><li> This running gag also continues in Apollo Justice only with the papers inverted.</li><li> And again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigationsMilesEdgeworth">Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth</a></em>, with Kay identifying one as a step-ladder. Miles comments that both of them are equally guilty of being dangerous during earthquakes.</li><li> Maya comments in <em>Spirit of Justice</em> that she's outgrown that debate. Phoenix is implied to be the tiniest bit upset about it.</li></ul></div><ul><li> Every time you visit the detention center and examine the guard (who's really just a part of the background image), Phoenix makes a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">smartass comment about his stoicism and general motionlessness</a>, because he's really just a part of the background image.</li><li> Phoenix's strange fixation with scrubbing the toilet, though this mostly appears in the third game. Both in the American AND Japanese versions.<ul><li> This one returns in <em>Dual Destinies</em>: in case two, Apollo makes mention of hoping to get a case and not clean the toilet again while in the DLC, Apollo responds to Nick's instruction for Apollo and Athena to do some work with 'Work? But we've already cleaned the toilet. Twice. Each.'</li></ul></li><li> There is also Charley the potted plant, who gets a special mention despite the fact that pretty much everything in Phoenix's office is a running gag because he even turns up after the law office is converted into a talent agency.</li><li> Speaking of office gags, starting in 1-4:</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Phoenix</strong>: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me.<ul><li> How this line finishes depends on the case, and whether there's anyone else present. Eventually they start collecting an impressive layer of dust. There's at least one amusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to the first instance of this, from 1-5:</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Ema</strong>: Oh, I tried studying one of those just now.

So, did you learn anything?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Ema</strong>: Well, when I tried reading it made my head hurt.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Phoenix</strong>: Oh...</div><div class="indent"><strong>Ema</strong>: Then, when I closed it, it slipped out of my hand and fell on my foot.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Phoenix</strong>: (Oddly enough I find myself identifying with her on this one...)</div></div><ul><li> Miles Edgeworth has poor luck with getting witnesses to introduce themselves on the stand.</li><li> "Anyone could wear that ____.

Even me!"</em></div><div class="indent"> <strong>Judge</strong>: <em>"Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image."</em></div><ul><li> The movie poster in Mia's office, said to be the first movie to make her cry. The gag being that nobody knows the title of the movie, including Mia. Eventually Maya tries to replace it with a Steel Samurai poster, but puts it back when she finally sees the movie (though the reader never hears the title either).<ul><li> In 4-4, Phoenix said he finally found out the name and watched it, and he might show it to Trucy sometime. Then he realised he forgot the name...</li></ul></li><li> The guy in the police station is always doing a different type of image training. It changes every time something new happens in the room.<ul><li> In 1-5, he instead seems to be writing a crime novel instead and comes up with different twists (including time machines and him being the murderer because of a split personality). At the end he switches to romance.</li><li> Incidentally, both time machines and split personalities turn up much later as plot points in <em>Spirit of Justice</em>.</li></ul></li><li> Likewise the lead detective in the back middle of the room. Phoenix always assumes the guy's hard at work on something, then gets irritated when he finds out the guy's just looking up gossip on the Internet.</li><li> <span style="display:none">invoked</span>The Gatewater Hotel from the first game's second case. Examining the window facing it in every case reveals that it goes from a no-name hotel to, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSuchThingAsBadPublicity">with the help of that case</a>, a famous five-star hotel and eventually, a <em>theme park</em>.</li><li> No one can seem to remember Wendy Oldbag's name, or at least know it well enough to not have a sense of doubt. This continues into the Court record. She's always listed as Security Guard or Ex-Security Guard. Her name is listed in her descripion but both Phoenix and Edgeworth note it with a sense of doubt.</li><li> There's also her undying love for Edgeworth, which, given her age, is pretty strongly unrequited.</li><li> Phoenix loves to present his Attorney's Badge to anyone he meets during investigations. Although necessary in a few cases (notably case 4 of the first game), mostly this is met with either confusion or ridicule.<ul><li> Phoenix himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this if Apollo presents his own badge to him.</li><li> Gumshoe also lampshades it in 1-5, noting that "you show this to me every time we meet, pal," then adds with a grin, "Real men show their police badge! 'Nuff said!"</li><li> Continued in <em>Investigations</em>, where you never actually get to use Edgeworth's Prosecutor Badge, and the flavor text states that he tends to keep it in his pocket. It's also lampshaded by none other than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">MANFRED VON KARMA</span>.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Apollo Justice</em> and <em>Investigations</em>, Phoenix and Edgeworth respectively seem to have a fondness for "grape juice." In huge glass bottles, in bars and VIP lounges. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrothyMugsOfWater">One might think that this is censorship of wine</a>, however, not only is the substitution of grape juice in both the English and Japanese versions, but why would they need to censor alcohol in a game about violent murders? This is lampshaded by Athena in Case 6-5 where she asks if Phoenix enjoyed the "fermented kind" but Apollo stated that it was the normal kind.</li><li> At least for the first three games, all end with Phoenix being put in a difficult position (the first game having this for both the last original case and the bonus case), and finally ending with one last "<em><strong>Objection!</strong></em>"</li><li> Throughout, whenever flowers are examined or brought up, Phoenix always mentions that the only ones he can identify are tulips and sunflowers. In the final case of <em>Apollo Justice</em> he has an epiphany and realizes that he can identify roses too. This is brought back again in "Turnabout Time Traveler," when Edgeworth hotly objects to Phoenix presenting flowers as evidence.</li><li> If you present the wrong piece of evidence to a magician in investigation parts, you can bet they will try to make evidence disappear. Max Galactica was the first to do this, followed by Trucy and Valant Gramarye - the only exception to this is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zak Gramarye in the past section of Case 4-4, as he was no longer in his magician persona</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Ruritania</a>: The small nation of Borginia, home country of Machi Tobaye and Romein LeTouse from <em>Apollo Justice</em> and Zinc Lablanc and Akbey Hicks from <em>Investigations</em>.

In 2014, this was re-released again for the 3DS, entitled <em>Gyakuten Saiban 123: Naruhodou Selection</em>, which and also includes some mild 3D "flat-layered" effects as well; the pack was also released early December 2014 outside Japan, titled <em>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame3DLeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame3DLeap">Video Game 3D Leap</a>: Though Phoenix and Maya already got the 3D treatment in the Layton crossover, the series' debut on the 3DS marks the jump for the series proper, allowing for more dynamic camera and angle work than in previous entries.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>: The closer you get the real murderer to confessing, the more out of control they get. Once the truth is revealed, they cry, scream, tear their hair and clothes, laugh hysterically, and sometimes <em>faint dead away</em>. Also, the more out of control they get, the more smug they get when the prosecuting attorney brings up something that could pull their ass out of the fire. However, the game's legal system is so heavily evidence-based that you can't just convict them on the basis that innocent people simply don't get this smug and be done with it. <br><br>As the series goes on, the breakdowns get progressively more elaborate and over-the-top. For example, while the first breakdown in the first game consists of the witness throwing his toupee, foaming at the mouth, and fainting, the final breakdown of <em>Prosecutor's Path</em> (the last game to use 2D sprites) has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Simon Keyes get pummeled by a series of animals he had trained, culminating in a gorilla punching him in the face so hard he spins and an elephant pulling him off-screen while the sounds of his beating continue</span>. The transition to 3D models has only amplified this trend.

Gumshoe also says "their's" at one point during <em>Investigations</em>. "Its" versus "it's" also rears its ugly head fairly often.<ul><li> The German translation is even worse. Whenever you spot a comma, there's what feels like at least a 50% chance it shouldn't be there. To make up for that, if a comma <em>should</em> be there, odds are it isn't. Another annoying typo in the German version is miscapitalization: <em>sie</em> 'she' and <em>Sie</em> 'you (formal)' sometimes show up in each other's place.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillNotUsePhotoshopInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillNotUsePhotoshopInTheFuture">We Will Not Use Photoshop in the Future</a>: Photographs are practically gospel, meaning players have to find a glaring inconsistency with other evidence or a testimony before it's questioned. Notoriously used in Case 2-2, when one of Franziska's arguments centers around proof that Maya physically shapeshifts into whoever she channels, before showing a picture of Maya channelling Mia in the Detention Center. Instead of assuming it's faked, everyone takes this at face value.<ul><li> Subverted in case 5-2.

In the games, it's used as a translation of the Japanese "Igiari", or "I disagree". Granted, it's definitely catchier.</li><li> The games tell you to find "contradictions in the testimony" whenever a prosecution witness testifies. Sometimes, the testimony contradicts itself, but more often it contradicts something like the autopsy report. It's not so much a contradiction "in" the testimony as a contradiction between the testimony and something that is probably more reliable.</li><li> Early games play loose with the definition of the word "lie." If a detective forgets a detail, someone will say that his testimony "contains a lie." If someone misinterprets a photograph and you have to point out something in the photo that disproves their claim, your assistant will say, "find the <strong>lie</strong> in the photograph!" Later games will let you know that testimonies might contain lies or mistakes when explaining cross-examinations.</li><li> The games refer to all interrogation of witnesses as "cross-examination." Cross-examination refers to interrogation of the opponent's witnesses, and follows direct examination, which is interrogation of the lawyer's own witnesses. While most witnesses in the series <em>are</em> summoned by the prosecution, exceptions date as far back as the bellboy in 1-2, and the defendant is interrogated in many cases.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouShouldntKnowThisAlready">You Shouldn't Know This Already</a>: It doesn't matter if you've already figured out who killed the victim, with what, or where, you'll still have to play cat and mouse with the witnesses and prosecution till you reach the appropriate point in the case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a>: The first three games take place between the years 2016 through 2019.
