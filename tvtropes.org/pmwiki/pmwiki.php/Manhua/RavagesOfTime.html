They probably include more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster">Chess Masters</a> than any other adaption, since the plot puts a good deal of focus on the politics and warfare of the Three Kingdoms period, and some of the main attractions of the series are the associated mind games, military strategies and battlefield tactics.

He himself is a liberal and broad-minded ruler and he has the backing of the Han Emperor. His armies have gone through numerous baptisms by fire - first L&uuml; Bu, then Yuan Shao and have came up top. His forces are nigh unbeatable, except for one fatal flaw &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> underestimating the enemy, which happens to be Zhuge Liang's favourite exploit</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Sun Shu and Xiao Meng (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeLooksLikeALady">who</a> might disagree, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender">no one cares</a>).

In an earlier volume, Sun Shu gets a bitter taste of her medicine when she tries to take on too many men and nearly gets raped. And there's hardly any mission that Xiao Meng is not at risk of grievous injury, rape or kidnapping, prompting Huo to put his life on the line to save him. And sure enough, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's badly wounded and goes MIA in volume 18 after engaging Gan Ning in direct combat, despite Huo's best efforts to rescue him.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a>: In the first few pages, the reader is treated to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> initiated by a monstrous man on the Imperial Guard's various lines of defense.

This turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> from the perspective of the series protagonist. Also, unknown to us at that time, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it establishes the eponymous duo of the series</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The series goes into more detail on pretty much everyone who appears in the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>. While it seems that Chen Mou made some of it up on the spot, other characters are well-researched, based on their biographies. One example is Gao Shun; in the manhua he thrashed Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan, which matches the historical record. Of course, the details are embellished.<ul><li> The side-story novel series is this to the manhua; but there are also enough significant changes to make some readers deny its canonity and consider in some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a>. In case you're wondering, the characters in the novels are portrayed as having far more emotional issues and being much more broken than their manhua counterparts (Xiao Meng and Sun Ce are blatant examples), certain important events are changed in details (like the circumstance of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Guo Jia</span>'s death and the aftermath of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dian Wei</span>'s death), significant additions are made in the character set (specifically, the current Crippled Legion has a sixth member). Oh, and the author also pulls no punches when he describes the stark reality of war and the misery of common people, which aren't shown in explicit detail in the manhua, making the novels even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> than the original adaptation.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Hua Rong arc, which began just after the end of Chibi, did this to the entire time when Cao Cao was retreating via. the titular Hua Rong valley. Instead of just Cao Cao and a few hundred men pathetically making their way back to Xuchang, it became a battle of wits between Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu, a mind-blowing betrayal (and double betrayal) committed by Zuo Ci and Sima Yi, which somehow led to the latter cementing his power base in the Cao faction. Finally, there was to be a titanic showdown between Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi as the former made use of snow and flood to trapped Cao Cao at Hua Rong. To top it off, Guan Yu was leading the final assault on the Cao's camp.</span></li><li> In the aftermaths of Chibi, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> What was a straight-forward conquest for the five southern provinces in Romance of Three Kingdoms become an all-out battle of wits and badassery when Lady Zhao, who was a minor character mentioned in just one page of the novel, turned out to be a full-fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> similar to Sima Yi</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>: Almost every notable general.

Shortly after the capitulation to Cao Cao, he's willing to commit insubordination in the prelude to Guandu, refusing to leave camp just to stay behind to dig up their slain brothers' remains. Then he beats the hell out of Yuan Tan's routed army for disrupting the exhumations.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateCharacterInterpretation">Alternate Character Interpretation</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>.
