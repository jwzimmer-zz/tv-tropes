<div id="main-article" class="article-content retro-folders">
<p></p><p></p><h2> The first book</h2><ul><li> In the first and second books, it's implied that Greg was forced to write in his journal by his mom. However, Greg's on his twelfth journal now. What happened then?<ul><li> I got the impression Greg enjoyed being able to vent about things in his journals and started writing in it on his own.</li><li> Alternatively, Greg at some point decided he would <em>sell</em> the journals once he became famous (which is consistent with his "Here's my journal. Now shoo, shoo." comment in the first book, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> attitude). More journals means more $$$.</li><li> Also, a diary sometimes serves as a sort of a substitute for a friend. Notice when they started to last for several months instead of a year/half a year? Since <em>Dog Days</em>. Just when his relationship with Rowley worsened.</li></ul></li><li> Why the Westmore Middle School didn't remove the Cheese from the blacktop? I know that the students didn't want to touch it because they didn't want to contract the "Cheese Touch", but why the school didn't send the janitor to clean up the blacktop and throw away such rotten and putrid piece of cheese? Or even the school staff feared to contract the "Cheese Touch" given that the janitor avoids cleaning the zone where the Cheese is in the movie...<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><li> You pretty much answered yourself at the end. It's also possible that the school simply don't care. Most adults are pretty apathetic in these books.</li></ul></li><li> How is possible that Greg managed to trick Mr. Jefferson into letting them play his violent video games by storing the discs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EdutainmentGame">Edutainment Game</a> cases? Those games are for preschoolers and I don't think Rowley's dad would have really believed that his son likes to play video games for little kids...<ul><li> Playing video games for little kids is totally in-character for Rowley.</li></ul></li><li> In the movies, why is it that Holly's beauty is so complimented by basically everyone, but Angie, who is no less pretty, isn't remarked upon once by anyone about her looks, other than Rowley seemingly having a bit of a thing for her?<ul><li> Beauty is subjective. Also the story is from Greg's point of view so since he's not attracted by Angie, he may not notice other people complimenting her looks because he don't care.</li></ul></li><li> Why Mr. Jefferson got so angry for the haunted mansion Greg and Rowley made on his basement? I don't see he would be so angry if Greg and Rowley weren't doing anything bad. They were just making a business (granted, not a good one), not vandalizing the house. I don't understand why Greg says that Rowley's dad didn't understand the whole matter, as explaining that you have made your own haunted mansion isn't a hard thing. Also, why Rowley's dad didn't force them into giving back his money to Shane Snella?</li><li> On Halloween in the first book, when dad soaks Greg and Rowley with a bucket of water, all they can salvage of their trick-or-treat candy is some mints wrapped in cellophane and toothbrushes. Does that mean <strong>none</strong> of their candy was wrapped besides the mints? Most of my Halloween candy has always been individually wrapped; is this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind">Two Decades Behind</a>, and there wasn't individually wrapped Halloween candy when the author was of trick-or-treating age?<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> More likely, it's a case of extremely bad luck on Greg's and Rowley's part.</li><li> I assume they were individually wrapped, but not in fluid-tight package, in a layer or two of paper. Most chocolate candies are still wrapped this way.</li></ul></li><li> When Greg calls Susan to tell her that he and Rowley will sleep at Grandma's house because three juvenile delinquents were threatening them only for Susan to order them to get back to the house because there was school tomorrow, why Greg just didn't tell his mom <em>why</em> they didn't want to leave Grandma's house? He could have called her to pick them up to force the three guys outside to leave, as Susan could call the police for assaulting Greg and Rowley...<ul><li> It can be hard to tell your parents when you get bullied and harassed. Plus Greg often don't communicate enough.</li></ul></li><li> Why the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWonderfulWizardOfOZ">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em> play had to be cancelled when Patty's glasses were broken? They shouldn't have had an understudy to fill Patty's role if anything happened to her? And even if they didn't have an understudy, was it really so hard to find another pair for glasses?<ul><li> It's not just a case of broken glasses, the problem is more the fact that there was a fight between the actors. Also, glasses are expensives, so no it's that that easy to find another pair.</li></ul></li><li> Why Greg thought that saying that he was the one who broke Rowley's arm was going to make him popular among the girls? If he had said something like "I was the one who helped him when he got his arm broken", the girls would have surely praised him for it. Okay, Rowley would know the truth, but Greg could have convinced him to not say anything about his fault on his accident, taking into account that Greg didn't have the intention to injure him...<ul><li> He doesn't understand how other people's mind work. He's so full of himself that he think whatever he does deserve praises.</li></ul></li><li> When Mr. Winsky forces Rowley to apologize to the kindergarteners for terrorizing them with an earth-worm, why the kindergarteners didn't tell Mr. Winsky or their teacher that it wasn't Rowley who chased them with the earth-worm but Greg? When Rowley apologizes to them, the look on their faces indicate that they don't understand why Rowley is apologizing to them, and that's because they know Rowley wasn't the one who scared them. Why they didn't tell the truth?<ul><li> They are very young, kids of that age tend to not talk alot to grown-ups that aren't family.</li></ul></li><li> Why was Greg's "Creighton the Cretin" comic edited so much, but Rowley's "Zoo-Wee Mama's" wasn't edited at all?<ul><li> One of two options: 1) Rowley's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">Ambiguous Disorder</a> has prompted the school to go against the idea of editing it, whilst ignoring Greg's egomaniac tendencies and possible sociopathy. 2) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">It's Greg.</a> The laws of physics would bend just to humiliate the kid.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Creighton the Cretin could have been seen as offensive by the staff, especially as Greg claimed to be basing it off of the students in his school. Rowley's comic wasn't making fun of anyone or any stupid behavior, its gimmick was zany twist endings.</li><li> After Greg complained about getting his comic rewritten, the teachers probably didn't want to risk a similar backlash with Rowley. As to why they wouldn't just use Greg's jokes unedited, they might've thought they were too mean-spirited.</li></ul></li><li> The film version: Why the Westmore Middle School allowed Patty Farrell's parents to let Patty join the wrestling course? Wrestling isn't unisex and if Patty had been forced to fight against another student who wasn't Greg (as Greg knew that boys can't beat up girls), chances are that she could have gotten hurt.<ul><li> It's shown that Patty is good at wrestling in general, not just against Greg. It's established that Patty can get whatever she wants from the teachers because her parents are high-placed, she even threatened to fire a teacher at the school play.</li></ul></li><li> The film version: After Rowley leaves Greg for Colin, why Rowley thought that Greg was going to be willing to give him back a video game that he forgot on his house? It should not have been better if Rowley had first made amends with Greg and then ask him if he could give him back his video game?<ul><li> Rowley did nothing wrong here. The game belonged to Rowley so if he ask for it then Greg should give it back without discussing. People <em>you</em> injured don't need to make amends to <em>you</em> so they can get their properties back. If anthing, it's Greg who should have given the game back on his own choice and apologize.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>Rodrick Rules</em></h2><ul><li> It says that Greg's dad types Rodrick's school reports for him since Rodrick doesn't know how to type. How can he not know how to type? What's there not to know? Press the M button to write the letter M, and so on.<ul><li> This is Rodrick we're talking about. He probably knows how to type at least basically, but acts like he doesn't so that his dad will do it for him.</li><li> He might just type very slowly. It's pretty certain that he hasn't put much effort into learning to type, so his typing skills are most likely limited to using the hunt-and-peck method extremely slowly. It's also possible that his horrible spelling skills slow him down further. This makes his parents decide it's easier if someone else does it for him.</li></ul></li><li> Greg's claim that the longest Rodrick has slept is 36 hours seems very implausible. Let's check some facts: Considering how much their Dad despises laziness from his sons, it doesn't seem likely that Frank would let Rodrick sleep that long and would wake him up around hour 13 at the most. Then it's shown Rodrick asking where Monday Night Football is after he wakes up, so we can assume he sleeps from a Sunday night all the way until Tuesday morning. Since he's wondering where Monday Night Football is, this clearly happened in Fall, hence school is in session. Did Susan and Frank actually let Rodrick miss school just so he could sleep? If they tried to wake him up to no avail, shouldn't they think something was wrong with him and they would call someone? Unless of course this was a Holiday Weekend like Columbus Day. Which brings me to my final and most important point: What kind of bum parents don't immediately tell their son that he slept through an entire day of his life? What if he never noticed? Would they ever have told him? Ugh.<ul><li> For the last one, it'd be rather hard for him not to notice at some point. If there was nothing else to alert him to it through the week, he'd at least realize it when the weekend comes and he still thinks it's a school day.</li><li> You're forgetting <em>who</em> these parents are.</li><li> Some schools give a four-day weekend over fall, either Monday-Tuesday or Thursday-Friday is off. It could have been during a fall recess - Greg doesn't state specifically <em>when</em> this happened, only that it was "last fall", so this could have been a "Fall recess". Not only that, but it's likely that, since Greg is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, he left a few things out - As the person above said, you have to remember just <em>who</em> these parents are, but it's possible their dad didn't throw Rodrick out of bed because Rodrick was sick, and they didn't tell Greg or Manny. (What reason do they have to want to do <em>ANYTHING</em> with Rodrick anyway?)</li><li> Alternatively, Rodrick's parents did try to wake him up, but he managed to sleep through all of their attempts.</li><li> Greg probably didn't tell the entire story, so there might have been some event (like being awake all night), after which long sleep is justifiable. The parents, of course, didn't expect him to sleep <em>that</em> long, but decided it would be better to just let him do it.</li></ul></li><li> How can Rodrick call himself a rocker and not know how to spell "door", as in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDoors">The Doors</a>"!<ul><li> Rodrick is a metal fan, and doesn't seem to be the type to concern himself with other genres of rock.</li><li> Kids these days....</li><li> He was also panicking at the time and may have misspelled it accidentally. Face it, even in the Wimpy Kid world, <em>nobody</em> who can drive a van and made it to high school is gonna not know how to spell "door".</li><li> Rodrick being that dumb is mostly for comedy. And for what we know, he may have dyslexia (which may be confirmed when he buys a bowl for Sweety the dog).</li></ul></li><li> When Mr. and Mrs. Heffley find out that Rodrick had the party while they were out for the night, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltByAssociation">they also punish Greg for it under the assumption that he was an "accomplice"</a>. But Greg clearly isn't anywhere in the photo (because he was locked in the basement) and they know he and Rodrick don't get along, which rules out the possibility that he'd willingly participate in a house-wrecking party such as that, so why would they jump to conclusions and not at least ask him if he had any part in this? I get that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Greg's parents aren't the brightest stars in the sky</a>, but still.<ul><li> Well, technically, Greg was an accomplice because he thought at first calling them to tell them about Rodrick's plans, but desisted because he foolishly believed that he could sneak into the party and wanted to see how a teenage party is. However, Susan and Frank have no way of knowing this unless Greg told them.</li></ul></li><li> The film version: At the beginning, why Susan and Frank let Taylor Pringle and her friends to beat up Greg for accidentally ruining her birthday cake?<ul><li> They are little kids, they can't do much to Greg.</li></ul></li><li> The film version: When he organizes his party, Rodrick locks up Greg on the basement so he would not be around his friends. Unlike the book version, Greg calls Rowley to help him get out of the basement, but Rodrick finds Rowley and locks him up on the basement as well. Fortunately, Greg calls his mother while she is calling Rodrick and forces Rodrick to let him and Rowley join the party, but if Greg hadn't call his mother, then Rodrick wouldn't have had a problem with keeping Rowley in the basement overnight? Rowley's parents could have been very worried...<ul><li> Rodrick not caring about this is totally in-character for him. That and he didn't have the time to think about it. It's extremly common in real life to do things that would have bad consequences but we don't think of it even if that would be obvious.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>The Last Straw</em></h2><ul><li> Though Ms. Craig said that there will be no consequences for the one who took her dictionary, when Corey Lamb puts the dictionary back on her desk, she changes her mind and grounds Corey by forcing him to stay in the class for a few days with no recess? Why she changed her mind if she had promised that there would be no consequences and why Corey nor other students told her that it was Alex Aruda the one who took her dictionary?<ul><li> Ms. Craig was just lying all along like most adults in these books. Telling it was Alex Aruda would be snitching and you really don't want to be a snitch in middle school.</li><li> Not to mention that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachersPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachersPet">Alex Aruda seems like a "model student"</a> so chances are Ms. Craig wouldn't believe any students who tried to tell her he took the dictionary.</li></ul></li><li> Why Greg lost all interest on Holly after she mistook him for Fregley? It just was an innocent mistake. After clearing the confusion, he could have flirted with her and even become her friend. He shouldn't have lost all interest on her just because she mistook him for another person who, to be honest, has a name which sounds similar to his surname...<ul><li> Likely because of his big ego. For Holly, calling him Fregley was just a meaningless mistake, but for Greg, this was a big insult.</li></ul></li><li> Why Frank didn't order Mr. Snella to erase the footage where Greg's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a> undies are exposed? He does thank Greg for the scene as he thought that Greg did it on purpose to save him for ridiculazing himself in an attempt to make Seth Snella laugh, but even so, he shouldn't have allowed Mr. Snella to keep the footage, as Mr. Snella possibly will include it in the videos he will send to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">America's Funniest Families</a>. Also let's take into account that Greg is still a minor and the footage could be considered child pornography as Greg is shown on his underpants, so both the channel and the Snellas could face legal action.<ul><li> Maybe Frank had a word with Mr. Snella about it offscreen and Greg wasn't there to witness it.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>Dog Days</em></h2><ul><li> Why Susan allowed Manny to buy fish food for himself? Couldn't Manny get intoxicated with that fish food, since he ate it?</li><li> Though Rodrick convinces Manny that the rear-facing seat is the most dangerous in the car, thus leading Greg to be ordered to sit there, why Manny moves back to the rear-facing seat after they leave the pool and Greg moves back to his usual seat? In addition, it shouldn't have been Rodrick the one who should have been ordered to sit on the rear-facing seat for giving Manny such ideas?</li><li> Why doesn't Greg just keep his bedroom door shut so the dog can't get to his bed?<ul><li> It is possible that the door doesn't lock.<ul><li> A shut door isn't the same as a locked door.</li><li> Well, as evidenced by many videos on <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTube">You Tube</a>, some dogs <em>can</em> open simple locks (like the turning doorknob) by themselves.</li></ul></li><li> Two things: One, he probably doesn't close the door all the way (so the dog an push in &mdash; most bedroom doors open <em>into</em> the room) and two, it's possible that his parents see the dog outside the door and let the dog in.</li><li> If the door isn't in good quality, a simple push may open it. Even a cat can open a closed door of bad quality.</li></ul></li><li> The film version: Why Greg didn't simply ask the steward to give him back his swimsuit instead of giving him some pink girl water shorts? The steward should realize that a boy like Greg would not wear girl shorts which say "I'm a Princess" and Greg could have told him something like "Hey man, I will really appreciate if you can give me back my swimsuit. It's there, because an annoying little girl threw it far from me to tease me after they got stuck on the trampoline".</li><li> The film version: If the country club doesn't employ minors, how come Holly gets to work as a tennis instructor?<ul><li> It was probably a volunteer thing. Or she knew their families, so even if she was being paid, she was being paid by the families and just using the courts there.</li><li> Her parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">are rich</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>The Ugly Truth</em></h2><ul><li> Why did the Peachy Breeze company shoot the commercial over and over again in the years instead of using the first commercial in the years?<ul><li> The adults are... y'know, idiots.</li><li> A commercial stops making an impression if you just see it again and again year after year. It's better to make a new one. And the repetition of the same basic script is actually pretty realistic&mdash;Sunny Delight commercials are one real-life example.</li></ul></li><li> When Greg went to the school lock-in, why did it take until <em>3 a.m.</em> for the parents to get worried enough about their kids not answering their mobiles?<ul><li> They probably assumed the kids were too busy to answer their phones which is why they took a while...but why they suddenly started getting worried because the kids wouldn't answer at a time when they SHOULD be asleep is still beyond me.<ul><li> Lock ins are basically like sleep overs. You aren't really expected to sleep much.</li><li> The kids are away for the night, surely some parents would use the opportunity to watch a movie, have a romantic dinner, something, anything having a kid present would prevent or impede.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Greg said that most of the chaperones at the lock in were parents, so how could only Greg and Rowley be the last people there? shouldn't have there been some more kids if their parents were the chaperones?<ul><li> Their parents probably took them home before things went awry.</li><li> Maybe some kids got sick and couldn't make it, but the parents decided to go anyway just to be nice.</li></ul></li><li> Why would Greg be eager to learn about the "Facts of Life" unit after he explicitly states <em>twice</em> earlier on in the book that educational materials about puberty grossed him out, especially considering he was required to sign a permission slip and had to trick his mother because she, in his words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">"only lets (him) watch G-rated movies"</a>?</li><li> Before agreeing to marry Sonja for the misunderstanding during the baseball game, why Gary considered breaking up with her to date <em>her sister</em>? Do you would really like to have for a sister-in-law one of your ex-girlfriends? I don't think so...<ul><li> It's pretty much established that Uncle Gary is an idiot.</li></ul></li></ul><h2> <em>Cabin Fever</em></h2><ul><li> How on earth did Manny turn off the power at the circuit breaker at his young age and in a flooded basement? How did Greg's mom NOT notice that the power was on in Manny's room &mdash; didn't she ever check on her youngest child all night?<ul><li> The part where Manny turns off the power would be unlikely but could happen. He just needed to see an adult do it first. Susan not going into his room to say goodnight is a little harder to buy. Maybe he told her not to come into his room? And she thought he was wrapping presents or something?</li><li> For the Susan not checking, don't forget her glasses had been broken by Manny. She probably just called to him, seeing as she couldn't see.</li></ul></li><li> If Greg had gotten arrested, would he have gotten a trial and been able to defend himself by saying the neon green paint was not his fault, but it was rainy when the posters were put up?<ul><li> He's a middle school kid and it was just two or three splotches of paint; I doubt he'd have gotten arrested once they determined it was him. Heck, when he explains exactly what happened to the principal, the principal basically says "you should have told me sooner" and gives him a comparatively light punishment (makes him clean the paint off with inefficient tools). If the police had been the ones to track him down, chances are they'd do what most police do in situations like this: explain it to the kid's parents and let them handle it.</li></ul></li><li> Manny changes Greg's Net Kritterz password so he can't get into his account. Shouldn't the site have a password recovery system?<ul><li> Like all sites such as these, yes there is a password recovery system &mdash; however, remember that Greg is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> &mdash; he probably doesn't state it because he doesn't <em>know</em> that it has a Password Recovery system. Alternatively, it might require an email address from his parents - meaning he'll have to ask them.</li><li> Usually, if a site asks for the parent's email, it's usually first asked when you register (You see this in literally every browser online game, like <em>Animal Jam</em> or <em>Club Penguin</em>.) so Greg would need the email even to have an account.</li><li> Susan named Gregory's Little Friend, so it seems like <em>she</em> was the one who created the account.</li></ul></li></ul><h2> <em>The Third Wheel</em></h2><ul><li> Why didn't Greg's parents get him vaccinated for Chicken Pox, let alone all the other parents of the kids who got it? DOAWK obviously takes place in the modern era, and the vaccine is supposed to be routine already. Greg's parents should have been sued.<ul><li> If DOAWK takes place in the modern era, then they probably didn't for fear Greg would become autistic. The question is how Greg and others went through Preschool, kindergarten, <em>and</em> elementary school <em>without</em> getting Chicken Pox.<ul><li> Many people go their whole life without getting chicken pox, especially since most people around them are immune.</li><li> By the way, no vaccines cause autism. That's total bunk. And the chicken pox one is still reasonably new, as it's only been around since 1995 compared to other vaccines. Most people are immune because they've either had it or have gotten the vaccine. That's how herd immunity works. Most people don't get it, and the people who can't get the vaccine, like people with weakened immune systems, babies, and the elderly aren't exposed. And exposure to chicken pox can cause shingles. So. But they shouldn't have been sued. Choosing not to vaccinate is a personal choice, and obviously is a trend in his area if that many kids got it.</li><li> Around the time Greg was young, it would have been during that paranoia where people <strong>a)</strong> didn't know Autism was something you were born with and <strong>b)</strong> read the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> that said Vaccines caused autism. Given how stupid the adults are as someone else mentioned, that's probably why Greg wasn't vaccinated - they probably <em>believed it</em>.</li><li> Then again, Susan is an inconsiderate and negligent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">moral guardian</a> <em>par excellence</em>, so chances are she was the one who took anti-vaccination attitudes at face value and refused to have Greg get a chicken pox vaccine.</li></ul></li><li> Greg himself lampshaded this in the book, saying that he didn't know you could GET chicken pox anymore, if that makes you feel better.</li><li> 2015 shows the return of measles caused by the autism scare. So... still don't believe me that they probably thought Greg would become autistic if he was vaccinated?</li></ul></li></ul><h2> <em>The Long Haul</em></h2><ul><li> In the film version of <em>The Long Haul,</em> Greg and the diaper become a huge Internet meme. Why, exactly? That kind of thing gets uploaded every day. It takes more than that to become a meme. The movie makers seem to think that anything slightly embarrassing caught on video will blow up across the web.<ul><li> Easy answer. The writers were dumbing themselves down in an attempt to make the kids laugh.</li><li> Maybe it's intended as a jab at people who make stupid stuff go viral.</li><li> Maybe <em>some</em>, but far from all, clips of someone doing something stupid or embarrassing go viral in the <em>Wimpy Kid</em> universe. It simply happens to Greg because of his bad luck. Stupid stuff going viral does happen from time to time in the real world too.</li></ul></li></ul><h2> <em>Old School</em></h2><ul><li> If the school sent home a list of items to bring to Hardscrabble Farms, why didn't it mention a blanket and pillow?<ul><li> Maybe the person who wrote the list didn't know that the farm people didn't supply bedding.</li><li> They just forgot. After all, pretty much everyone in the <em>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> universe is incompetent.</li></ul></li><li> I know that Greg is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, but they use all the leftovers that the kids don't eat. Doesn't this strike <em>anyone</em> as unsanitary?!<ul><li> Maybe they believe there's no risk of spreading diseases as long as the leftovers are heated properly.<ul><li> Cross contamination, food going <em>bad</em>?</li><li> You answered your own question. Greg is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, therefore he was being less than honest about what was happening at the camp. Alternatively, everyone in charge is a complete moron. This is the <em>Wimpy Kid</em> universe after all.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The first book took place in 6th grade, books 2 and 3 were 7th, and 5-8 were 8th. Greg should be in high school as of this book but it says he's still in middle school.<ul><li> Jeff Kinney has confirmed the series is timeless, so Greg won't age.</li></ul></li></ul><h2> <em>Double Down</em></h2><ul><li> How can the battery-powered electronic witch decoration continue to cackle at the slightest response to noise <em>after</em> its batteries were removed, especially upwards of a year after that?<ul><li> Perhaps it had two sets of batteries for some weird reason, and only one of them was removed.</li></ul></li></ul><h2> <em>The Getaway</em></h2><ul><li> Has anyone remembered that the Heffleys have a <em>pet pig</em>? If so, then who was taking care of him while the family were out to Isla de Corales?<ul><li> Don't forget, Grandpa Heffley still lives with them. Perhaps he stayed home to take care of the pig while the rest of the family went on their trip.</li><li> Answered in <em>The Meltdown</em>. They left the pig in a kennel.</li></ul></li><li> Why the couple who sit with Greg put their baby on Greg's seat after Greg went to the bathroom? Did they forget that Greg was sitting there?<ul><li> Maybe they assumed that Greg had changed seats after he didn't return to the bathroom?</li></ul></li><li> One day, when Greg was doing an activity with the other kids playing tennis, as soon as all the other kids got into the court, the counselor Rodrigo <em>locked the kids in there for an hour and a half without even bothering to teach them tennis or at least give them rackets</em>. Now wait just a doggone minute! Is this some form of child abuse?! If they were really trapped for about an hour and a half, shouldn't there be other adults who are passing by and noticed this problem? Any normal person would call security and have them talk to the counselor about it! And wasn't the scene recorded in the <em>security camera</em>?<ul><li> Probably due to some sort of cultural differences between the US and wherever Isla de Corales is at and tourists have nothing they can do but accept that this is how the resort handles tweens. Either that, or many of the adults (even visiting ones) don't really care since it makes for some time to relax unimpeded.</li></ul></li><li> During the cruise, when scuba diving, Greg thought he accidentaly swallowed a sea horse, which causes his family to call off the cruise and head to the dock. The family got a bit seasick and had to spend the rest of the day trying to relax. But get this: <em>they totally forgot all about Rodrick, leaving him out in the middle of the water, suffering from sun poisoning</em>! Seriously, how can they forget about their oldest son?! Shouldn't the cruise captain notice it also? Didn't Rodrick yell something like ''Hey, wait, don't leave me behind!"? Wasn't Rodrick fit enough to swim back to shore?<ul><li> Maybe Rodrick was swimming under the sea when they left, so he was unable to hear them leaving and when he came out of water they were already too far to hear him.</li></ul></li><li> Why did the Director of Fun threw the bucket with the box jellyfish in it into the pool when he freaked out? Seriously, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">the jellyfish was in a bucket</a></em>! It wasn't going to do any harm to anyone to begin with!<ul><li> The reason he threw it in the first place was because he was so scared by the sight of a box jellyfish in a kid's sand pail. He only threw it into the pool because he was standing right next to the pool.</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of which, <em>HOW did Manny even catch such a poisonous jellyfish</em>?</li><li> Why do the Heffleys believe that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardTruthAesop">When Heffleys get in trouble, Heffleys run</a>" especially when involving with security?<ul><li> Presumably, because it's proven to be a tactic that works.</li></ul></li><li> On page 115, Greg traps a spider under the food cover. But the spider's leg sticks out from under the cover, and Greg pushes down on the cover so that the spider loses its leg. But in the very next sentence, he says that the spider fell down on the floor. How did that happen? Greg never mentions actually releasing the spider. One second the spider is under the cover (minus one leg), the next it's on the floor.</li><li> This was pointed out by my mom. How is possible that the staff of Isla de Corales can't track down the Heffleys nor discover their identities if they checked in at the hotel? Even if they were kicked out from the resort, they gave their names when they checked in...</li><li> So the Heffleys manage to get themselves into trouble by giving the greenlight to stealing the clothes from the suitcase they mistakenly ended up with and trying to sneak back into the resort after they were kicked out. Ignoring their selfish motives to do so and that they clearly hadn't learned from "The Long Haul;", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalHypocrisy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalHypocrisy">why would two parents as strict and eager to scold/punish Greg for relatively minor infractions be OK with flat out breaking the law</a>, especially they after they <em>know</em> they could get in trouble for re-entry? It just doesn't add up.<ul><li> Susan can be a huge hypocrite and Frank is kinda apathetic.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>The Meltdown</em></h2><ul><li> In The Meltdown, they make no mention of Grandpa Heffley. Is he still living with them? Did he move out?</li><li> How Greg even <strong>considered</strong> the possibility of throwing hot chocolate on the Lower Surrey Street kids?!?!?! I get it that he got the idea after reading medieval warfare tactics, but even if what he was intending to throw wasn't boiling oil, the hot chocolate would have surely left serious skin burns on those kids' faces and then Greg could have gotten on a very, big problem. The Lower Surrey Street kids were really lucky that Rowley forgot to add hot water to the mix...<ul><li> Perhaps Greg didn't want to make the hot chocolate <em>that</em> hot and intended to keep it at an ample temperature to simply shock the Lower Surrey Street kids into running off.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p><h2> <em>Wrecking Ball</em></h2><ul><li> How was the three-year-old Manny able to build a full house and sprinkler system in his family's yard all by himself? Other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, that is.</li><li> The house the Heffleys were planning to sell was destroyed because whoever was running the crane screwed up. Why weren't the Heffleys compensated?</li></ul>
