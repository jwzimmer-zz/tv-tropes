One of the more recent Bat-Villains to make "the leap" to a top-tier threat was Bane, created in the 1990s for a specific purpose: to enable the writers to get Bruce Wayne out of the Bat-costume and replace him with a character intended to turn the readers against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">'90s Anti-Hero</a> Azrael, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">Nineties Anti Heroes</a> in general. The gambit worked spectacularly well.</p><p>To say Bane had a bad life is putting it mildly; he was essentially raised in a Central American prison, sentenced there for life <em>while still in the womb</em> for a crime committed by his father. However, once he managed to be old enough to defend himself, he thrived, and was selected for an experimentation program where he was made more durable (via the implantation of subcutaneous armor) and, more importantly, had a delivery system for a super steroid implanted in his body. While not quite superhuman in strength, when on the drugs he was very close, and combined with his genius-level intellect represented a foe unlike any Batman had faced to that point: one arguably as cunning as he was, but with far more physical prowess. After wearing Batman down, Bane eventually caught up to him and shattered his spine. Although eventually defeated by AzBats, that one storyline gave the character enough credibility that he instantly shot up to be one of the top Bat-Villains, and merited appearances on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>, and in the disastrous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanAndRobin">Batman &amp; Robin</a></em> movie as a result.

Let the Batman <strong>die</strong> with me."</em>'</div><p>When Barry Allen went back in time to save his mother from being murdered by Eobard Thawne, he succeeded but created unintended changes to the timeline, which created the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a> timeline. One of these changes was that it was a young Bruce Wayne, and not his parents, who died when they were mugged in Crime Alley. Driven by immense grief, Thomas became a more brutal and violent Batman, while Martha became their universe's Joker.</p><p>Thomas assisted Barry in restoring the timeline to its proper state, with the knowledge that it would lead to Bruce surviving and becoming Batman and his own death. Barry (mostly) succeeded, with Thomas apparently dying along with his timeline... until it was mysteriously recreated, keeping him alive to deal with the consequences of his actions.</p><p>After meeting his adult son and giving him parting words, encouraging him to be a father to his son and give up his life as Batman, Thomas resigned himself to dying as he had lived... only to be brought to the main DCU by a spiteful Eobard Thawne for foiling him to begin with. There, he learned that Bruce did not give up being Batman, and he does not take this well, deciding to join with other Batman villains to <em>force</em> Bruce into retirement.</p><hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>: In-universe, anyway, he's considered the greatest of the Flashpoint timeline's heroes... which says a lot about how crappy that world is. The heroes are only willing to work together to stop Atlantis and Themyscira from fighting if he leads them, and from what we see, he's not particularly good at that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>: He's implied to drink a lot and we see him drunk before his "final mission" with Barry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesis">Arch-Nemesis</a>: Martha's Joker is his. He wasn't supportive as she was grieving their son and a comment he made essentially began her transition into the monster she would become. He considers her one of his greatest mistakes and regrets all the suffering she caused, from crippling his Selina Kyle to causing the deaths of two children. He still loves Martha deep down but is seemingly able to separate that from his hate for the Joker. The two reconcile somewhat when he tells her helping Barry will bring Bruce back... only for Martha to kill herself when she finds out this will turn Bruce into Batman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesisDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchNemesisDad">Arch Nemesis Dad</a>: He becomes this during Tom King's <em>Batman</em> run, working with Bane to so utterly and completely break Bruce to the point that they'd <em>force</em> him to stop being Batman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicPlaything">Cosmic Plaything</a>: Thomas' world is brought back by Dr. Manhattan &mdash; essentially a god figure at the time &mdash; <em>purely</em> to fuck with Barry and Bruce and encourage Bruce to stop being Batman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>: His entire shtick as Batman is that he is one of the edgiest Batmen you will find. He casually uses guns and murders and is driven entirely by loss with none of Bruce's redeeming qualities like compassion and friendship. The <em>only</em> reason he helps Barry is because it will save Bruce, and his entire motivation is giving Bruce the life Thomas thinks he should have.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>: How capable he is. Geoff Johns had him as a Batman who wasn't particularly experienced with superpowers but was more of a tactician. Brian Azzarello had him as a slower, more down-to-earth and gritty Batman who was pulpier and less agile. Tom King has him as an uber Batman that is basically Bruce at his peak times 10.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusAngstMachina">Deus Angst Machina</a>: The more we learn about his character, the more we learn how much his life absolutely <strong>sucks</strong>. His son died in a robbery attempt which broke his wife, and he himself did her no favours by losing his patience with her when she was grieving, causing her to turn into the Joker. His world is an absolute shit show, with the Amazons and Atlanteans engaged in a war that has consumed all of Europe and much of the world. He managed to help Barry fix the world and was accepting of his death... only for his world to be brought back by a higher power. He got to talk to his son and once more accepted his death after getting some closure... only for Eobard Thawne to bring him to the main DCU to spite him. Finally, we learn he had a sidekick in the form of his universe's Catwoman, who he saw as a daughter figure... who was crippled by the Joker and made a quadriplegic. Oh, and then he gets his spine broken by Bane. Yeah, this goes a long way towards explaining why he doesn't seem to care if he dies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>: He serves as Bane's when Bane kicks his revenge scheme into high gear &mdash; because Bane needs to pretend to be feeble in Arkham, and because having to fight Thomas would emotionally hurt Bruce, he does most of the fighting and heavy lifting while Bane takes on the role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonAscendant">Dragon Ascendant</a>: He eventually usurps Bane as <em>the</em> villain of Tom King's <em>Batman</em> run, since his beef with Bruce is more emotionally driven while thematically tying into King's run and character analysis of Batman. Plus, Bane wants to completely destroy Bruce before killing him, whereas Thomas just used Bane to help him accomplish the first part &mdash; the second part is where their plans diverge, since Thomas wants Bruce to be alive and healthy afterwards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a>: Eventually becomes one to the original Thomas Wayne.

These are things that Tom King tackled with Bruce, in that Bruce <em>was</em> initially Batman purely because of his dead parents and it was an alternative attempt at suicide for him... but life as Batman changed him for the better, giving him new people to live for and a new reason to keep living.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail">For Want of a Nail</a>: His character is meant to be identical to the original Thomas Wayne until the murder at Crime Alley.

However, Roman's parents were extremely neglectful and uncaring towards their son; he grew to resent them and the "Masks" they wore (of good, friendly people), when in private they were miserable. Sionis eventually killed his parents, but ran their business into the ground, at which point it was bought out by Bruce Wayne. Sionis snapped, breaking into his parents' crypt and carving a mask out of his mother's coffin. An attempt to get revenge on Wayne by lashing out at his employees failed due to the intervention of Batman, and ended up causing Sionis's Black Mask to be burned onto his face, making it unremovable.<p>Sionis was a capable gangster (often leading a mask-themed gang called the False-Facers), managing to regain his hold over organized crime after long stays in jail. Sionis grew even more insane and obsessed with torture as time went on. In a notable <em>Catwoman</em> arc, Sionis discovered Selina Kyle's secret identity, and in vengeance for Catwoman attacking his drug rings, tortured Kyle's brother-in-law to death, and forced her sister to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">eat pieces of his corpse</a>, driving her insane. Sionis was thought dead when after an extended fight, he fell out of his penthouse.</p><p>Later, in the <em>War Games</em> story arc, Black Mask managed to successfully play the opposing forces of a Gotham Gang war against each other. He managed to kill Orpheus, one of Batman's inside men, and assume his identity, and tortured Stephanie Brown, alias the Spoiler, leading to her apparent demise. Sionis became the de facto leader of all of Gotham's organized crime following this. He was later killed when he once again sought to ruin Catwoman's life mistakenly believing she would abide by the No-Kill rule, she responded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim">shooting him</a>.

The countless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> stories that Joker fed her were likely a part of it, since Harley has proclaimed that ever since she laid eyes on the clown, it was love at first sight.</p><p>Though it was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> that introduced her (originally as just the Joker's henchgirl), Harley became popular enough to be included in the comics as well, and it was a comic (later adopted into a TV episode) that first told her origin. Perhaps even crazier than the Joker himself, you can count on Harley to be right alongside her "puddin'", mindlessly loyal to him, but cleverly lethal.</p><p>Not even Harley can stand the Joker's endless tirades of abuse and madcap lifestyle, however, and when she's in her downtime, she often finds consolation in Poison Ivy, whom she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">a deep friendship with</a>.</p><p>Has had three solo series, the tropes for which can be found <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">here</a>.</p><p>Thanks to the character's popularity, she has appeared in various adaptations.

In the New 52, Harley getting her skin bleached could likely be a nod to Alicia in the film having acid thrown on her face that disfigures her and requires her to wear a mask. Harley's abuse at the hands of the Joker in general also references how Alicia was treated badly if getting acid thrown on her face before throwing herself out the window is any indication.

In the animated series, she also appears to be on friendly terms with Professor Jonathan "Scarecrow" Crane &mdash; he even stops ranting and screaming at the guards just long enough to smile and say hello to her.

Eventually, his father's abuse got so bad that he decided to apply his studies to improve his own life, by cutting the brakes on his parents' car before they had a drive, intending to inherit their money and live by his own way. Unfortunately, thanks to Bruce's father, Dr. Thomas Wayne, Tommy's now crippled and needy mother survived, which was the worst thing that could happen to him. Bruce and Tommy remained best friends, however, and Tommy nearly confessed his murders to Bruce while the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedRowboatDate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldFashionedRowboatDate">kayaked around</a> at summer camp, only to be interrupted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">surprise arrival of his mother</a>. Tommy's resulting outburst of anger led him to being committed to Arkham for the rest of the summer, where, with the help of Dr. Crane, he was consumed by the paranoid belief that Bruce had somehow conspired with Mrs. Elliot to ruin his fun.

However, when Eddie Nygma AKA The Riddler offered him a way of curing his mother's cancer, Tommy learnt that his former friend Bruce was the Batman (Riddler having figured out his identity in a moment of Lazarus Pit-induced insanity). Tommy decided that enough was enough and that Bruce had to be cut down to size and pay for "his crimes against me".

He was then turned into a guffawing, buffoonish trickster thanks to the combined influence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode">The Comics Code</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">the 1960s television series</a>. When he was revived in the 1970s, he was turned back into the dangerous madman of his earliest appearances, but made more scary by also retaining his Silver Age mischievousness and random craziness - such as trying to patent Joker-fish and murdering patent office staff when they wouldn't let him. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeofComicBooks">the Dark Age</a> came along, Joker soon had the single highest body count in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>. While he's outdone by the aliens and supervillains who can (and do) wipe out cities/planets, for a man who has nothing other than a criminally sharp mind and a twisted sense of humor, he's still got an "impressive" body count.

In nearly every published Batman crossover/AU comic, The Joker is there as well. Joker has claimed again and again that Batman is the sole reason for his existence &mdash; and that they're more alike than Bats will ever admit.</p><p>The Joker, as portrayed in various media &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Batman1989">Tim Burton's 1989 film</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, and many an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">Alternate Continuity</a> &mdash; is a little bit different from the comic book version: The former is treated (if in unspoken terms) as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">gadfly</a> who has managed to con (or will con) the mob, crimefighters, and even the legal system into thinking he's insane in the clinical sense of the term, when really he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe">just enjoys carnage and mayhem</a>, and was likely a murderous bastard even before donning the clown mask. The modern, mainstream comic book Joker is treated as though he really <em>is</em> crazy and (in abstract terms) someone Batman sees as a psychological torment rather than just a guileful crook; a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbstractApotheosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbstractApotheosis">demon sent by the city itself</a> to foil his mission.

For a price, would-be ne'er-do-wells could hire Cleer's services, and he in turn would help them evade capture and cover their tracks. After several encounters with Batman, the Dark Knight managed to permanently dismantle Moth's organization, and his secret identity and fortune were lost forever.<p>Killer Moth (now revealed to be small-time criminal Drury Walker) continued to endure, however, committing smaller-scale robberies and picking up jobs as hired muscle. Sick of being perceived as a joke by his fellow rogues, he made a deal with Neron for greater power and became a towering moth/human hybrid. The deal has since been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">written out of history</a>, though, and Walker has reverted to his previous form.</p><hr><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: A decidedly less sinister take on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacabreMothMotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacabreMothMotif">Macabre Moth Motif</a>; in most appearances, he just wears a moth-like outifit and employs an adhesive "cocoon gun" during heists.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>: The biggest of Batman's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Even Evil Has Standards</a>: He was working with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyroManiac">Firefly</a> for a short while as a mercenary duo before realizing just how dangerously unstable his partner actually was (he believed that he could see visions in the flames, for starters), causing him to cut things off ASAP because he genuinely feared for his life. Interestingly, he would later visit the other side of this trope when allying with two other small-time supervillains to kidnap Bruce Wayne, Commissioner Gordon and Armand Krol. The other two genuinely thought they were going to release the hostages. Walker just dumped all three in a deathtrap and walked away.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">Harmless Villain</a>: He's considered the weakest supervillain in Gotham and is usually captured pretty easily by Batman and company.
