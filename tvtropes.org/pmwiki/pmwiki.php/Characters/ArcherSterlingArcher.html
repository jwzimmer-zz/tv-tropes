Archer never learns his lesson about being a better person, which makes him highly and reasonably disliked among his peers. However, a major recurring issue for Archer in this trope is that he <em>is</em> repeatedly made aware of his faults, and oftentimes <em>doesn't</em> simply blow them off or ignore them, but his efforts to truly change are often stymied as much by his dysfunctional coworkers and family as they are by himself; essentially, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">any progress he tries to make tends to get shot down</a> because he continues to interact with people who directly feed his issues in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>: Drinks cocktails all the time, among other alcoholic beverages, and has been drinking since before he was 12 (His mother even hinted that she used alcohol as his primary pacifier). Archer often drinks a ton on assignments, really strong stuff too, and has switched out necessary equipment for more booze. The effect the constant drinking on his job performance varies.<ul><li> It sometimes gets to the point where if he's too drunk, he needs to take lighter drinks to lower the buzz.<ul><li> One time, he vowed to stave off drinking for a woman he legitimately loved [Katya], he said that he needed to ease his abstinence slowly or else <em>"the collective hangover would literally kill him"</em>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlcoholicParent">Alcoholic Parent</a>: Still drinks even after becoming a dad.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonChaser">Amazon Chaser</a>: The two women that Archer ever truly fell for were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Lana</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Katya</a>.<ul><li> He also slept (and, according to him, had the best sex of his life) with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">Pam</a>, although their relationship doesn't progress beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits">best friendship</a> (which for Archer, is a pretty big deal).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousDisorder">Ambiguous Disorder</a>: Numerous hints throughout the series suggest that Archer has some form of autism: he is often the only character to count bullets during gun fights, including multiple automatic weapons; this coupled with his ability to identify the make and model of firearms allows him to ascertain when enemies are reloading. He is able to identify the make and model of a blender in Fugue and Riffs just by hearing the sound it makes through the phone, and he has an unusual affinity for animals and is able to 'converse' with Babou and Kazak. Archer also shows an inability to pick up on social clues and a lack of empathy on the cognitive level, rather than being void of it entirely, eats baby aspirin, and seems to be unable to dress himself without help from Woodhouse. Another characteristic is his voice, which stays very monotone and changes only in response to strong emotions, particularly rage. The possibility of Archer being on the autism spectrum is directly addressed in the episode Coyote Lovely; when asked if he is autistic, Archer first mocks Lana for suggesting it, but after identifying Border Patrol's Ruger 6s and realising they were out (after being <em>shot in the back</em>) he remarks, "Holy shit, maybe I am autistic?" before collapsing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi">Ambiguously Bi</a>: To date, he was willing to, and with some liking judging by the finger he held up to Lana during the act <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kiss Ramon Limon while he was (apparently) dying</span>, and when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">locked in a cell in San Marcos with Gustavo Calderon two cells down, and his wife in between them, the three of them have been having sex through the bars. When Juliana is taken upstairs by Cyril so she can marry him, Gustavo asks if Archer "wants him to move over one." Archer seriously considers the idea</span>. And in "The Archer Sanction" it is revealed that "Bang Joe Frazier" is on his bucket list. He also had a devil's threeway with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Skorpio and Lana</span> in "Skorpio", though he seems to regret it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>: Selfish, vain, childish, but unquestionably a hero.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!</a>: Archer gets <em>distracted</em> very easily, usually by alcohol, hookers, adorable animals, or anything relating to Burt Reynolds. Sometimes all of the above.<div class="indent"> <strong>Archer</strong>: What the hell was that? <br><strong>Cheryl</strong>: Ugh&#133; my stupid pet ocelot. <br><strong>Archer</strong>: &#133;(<em>with child-like glee</em>) <em><strong>I've never SEEN an ocelot!</strong></em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>: A rare case of a person being this. When in the field he's single handedly captured an entire space station, defeated a KGB hit squad armed with automatic weapons using only Molotov cocktails, an ice scoop and a broom handle, sneaked past an entire armed force of enemy agents while a litre low on blood and drunk. His behavior at literally everything else, however, makes his inhuman abilities wildly impractical, to the point that he's been deliberately shot three times by his own co-workers for how much he irritates, belittles, and berates them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Awesome Mc Coolname</a>: Sterling Archer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBadActing">Bad "Bad Acting"</a>: Probably because he revels in being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertOperative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertOperative">Overt Operative</a>, Archer is <em>terrible</em> at undercover work.

It's his good luck, combined with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Made of Iron</a> status, that keeps him alive in spite of his own incompetence.<ul><li> Brought to its logical extreme in "Edie's Wedding," where he manages to drive straight to the grain elevator where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Barry is holding Pam hostage</span> despite not knowing anything about the area, knocking out the one person who could guide him to the grain elevator, and <em>not even knowing what a grain elevator was</em>.

Archer notices this, somehow.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a>: While on the surface, Archer is a brainless egotist, the show makes it clear he genuinely <em>is</em> the world's most dangerous spy. Archer boasts unparalleled skills in almost every field needed to be a secret agent, incredible in-depth knowledge about a wide variety of topics (some quite obscure), and some outright savant-like genius abilities. He's even able to count the number of shots being fired from multiple guns being used simultaneously in a fire-fight and keep track of exactly how many bullets each shooter has left. Unfortunately he's also a selfish hedonist whose concern isn't whatever mission he's supposed to be handling but rather his own comfort and (short-sighted) entertainment. His main motivation for being a secret agent seems to mostly be so he can travel the world getting drunk and bedding women.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Broken Ace</a>: Known around the globe as the world's most dangerous spy, and displays almost absurd levels of strength, durability and fighting skill.

He once almost cried recounting a sad story about a little girl who drowned to Lana.<div class="indent"> <strong>Archer</strong>: That is the third saddest thing I have heard today&#133; Pam told me a story about a little girl who drowned trying to save a puppy. <br><strong>Lana</strong>: Jesus!

He's also narcissistic, unprofessional, and all around jackass. When he's not on a mission, he's sleeping with inordinate numbers of women and getting blackout drunk. He also sleeps around and gets blackout drunk during missions, too, but still manages to avoid getting killed. Whether or not he actually completes the mission itself is a whole other issue.</li><li> Arguably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>, as he <em>is</em> a highly skilled agent, but often fails at his missions precisely due to his quirks and unprofessionalism.<div class="indent"> <strong>Archer</strong>: So I crashed a few cop cars, ran over a few mimes!

When he believed Abbiejean to be in legitimate danger, he became grounded, serious, and downright murderous toward the man who threatened to harm her, stating that for threatening his daughter he would personally beat him to death with his bare fists. Even though it turned out to be an extremely elaborate ruse by Lana, Archer showed a fiercely protective and paternal side to his personality that made him take far less risks and his daughter's safety his number-one priority. He also begins to be more outspoken against his mother's critiques regarding his and Lana's parenting style. One instance being when he threatened to have Malory arrested if she gave baby A.J. diet pills in response to Malory commenting on how fat she was (and not for the first time, either). This shows an increasingly independent side to Archer, who no longer seems to fear his mother's wrath.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>: Archer's love of animals (except alligators) comes up frequently in the series. However, in the pilot episode, he freaks out when he sees that the air stewardess that he brought back to his penthouse also took her dog with her. Four episodes later, he barely bats an eye when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements">lemur</a> attacked one of his prostitutes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a>: In season 2.

Also, his "sentimental" memories of his deceased valet Woodhouse all involve the horrific physical abuse that he inflicted on Woodhouse on a regular basis.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptedCharacterCopy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptedCharacterCopy">Corrupted Character Copy</a>: Archer is less an expy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond">James Bond</a> and more a counter to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TuxedoAndMartini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TuxedoAndMartini">Gentleman Spy</a> archetype in general.

Archer is an insensitive lech to women, but typically treats the men in his life with open contempt and disdain. Even male celebrities who he admires like Kenny Loggins and Burt Reynolds usually end up in conflict with him and getting insulted when he actually meets them. He almost always falls into Alpha-male bullying behavior around other men and treating them like weaklings, almost to the point of being the gender inverted version of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleMisogynist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemaleMisogynist">Female Misogynist</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>: Sometimes fulfills this role to his mother's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, often without even realizing he's helping her perform criminal acts.

He states that, although his motive was entirely selfish (revenge for selling his hospital fake chemotherapy drugs) he does point out to Lana that his conscience can't rest easy since the gangsters were still selling fake cancer medicine, which is pretty heinous.<div class="indent"><strong>Lana</strong>: Still though, you really want to take on the Irish mob? <br><strong>Archer</strong>: No, I don't, but they've been switching out lifesaving cancer drugs with candy and Zima.</div></li><li> In "Jeu Mon&eacute;gasque", while Lana and Ray were right to be angry at Archer for losing their retirement money, Archer points out that while he inadvertently lost the money for the ISIS retirement accounts, his mother was the one who stole it in the first place.

He even tried to prevent Krieger from curing Ray's paralysis with bionic legs because of it. One flashback shows that this might date back even further, to when Archer almost castrated himself with a home-made sex robot as a child.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>: His selfishness and egotism has nearly gotten himself and his co-workers killed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaglesLaw">Finagle's Law</a>: He will screw up any mission he is given in any way possible.

Archer mentions that, in spite of his sizeable paycheck, and bonuses, and the fact that he pads his expenses by about fifteen percent, he still lives paycheck-to-pycheck because of his opulent lifestyle. He also seems to be chronically incapable of comprehending that Malory pays for his penthouse. Even though she had Woodhouse lock him out in "Job Offer", he is still shocked when the federal government seizes it along with everything else ISIS owned in season five.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>: <em>Oof.</em> Let's just say that Dr. Freud would have had a field day with Sterling's case. Archer's dysfunction is a result of growing up with a negligent and outright abusive mother, as revealed in a number of flashbacks to his traumatic childhood. She abandoned him until the age of five, then sent him off to 12 straight years of boarding school. Other examples include abandoning him on Christmas Eve with no way to get home, taking all of his Halloween candy from him in a poker game, stealing his unattended bike to "teach" him about responsibility&#133; without <em>giving it back or mentioning it further</em> afterwards and giving him liquor at a young age. After several flashbacks, various characters admit that it "explains a lot" about Archer's personality.<ul><li> There's also the bullying he endured in prep school. One incident nearly killed him and left him in the hospital with pneumonia for a month.</li><li> He was also (statutory) raped by his nanny when he was 12, which would explain quite a bit about his sleeping around.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>: Oddly enough.

He also has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture, and knows his way around history and classic literature. He's also surprisingly proficient with electronics, creating increasingly elaborate pranks and even rerouting his answering machine to Cheryl's mansion to set off lights and techno music when full, a feat that impresses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Krieger</a>.</li><li> Sterling is pretty incompetent in most things, but he's the best field agent there is. He's also incredibly slow on the uptake on a number of occasions, but he also displays a surprisingly hefty education, apparently coming from his years at a boarding school. In one exchange that exemplifies the dichotomy, he overhears two mooks on a space station make an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnimalFarm">Animal Farm</a></em> reference. Archer knows that <em>Animal Farm</em> is "an allegorical novella about Stalinism by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeOrwell">George Orwell</a>," but thought they were talking about an actual animal farm.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>: Of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist</a> variety. Being an agent doesn't mean he is a nice person at heart.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">Handicapped Badass</a>: Archer is diagnosed with breast cancer in season 2; in one of the episodes, "Placebo Effect", he goes on a rampage when he discovers the Irish mob were using fake chemo medications to make a profit. Even when vomiting and fatigued due to the effects of the real chemotherapy, Archer still proves a threat. He becomes an even better example in Season 11, as while his muscles have atrophied from his three-year coma (on top of moderate nerve damage from being shot multiple times) and he now must walk with a cane, he is given a weaponized "Tactile-Cane" by Krieger with a variety of functions, and once he has it, he starts to become just as badass as he used to be after three years in a coma and an additional three months after that of almost never leaving his apartment made him a lot weaker.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Handsome Lech</a>: He's fairly attractive, but a bit of a dick.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveIMentionedIAmGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveIMentionedIAmGay">Have I Mentioned I Am Gay?</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">Funny Moment</a> for him in "Honey Pot". The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">Straight Gay</a> Ramone states that he's actually <em>too gay</em> for his tastes.

While Archer doesn't really get along with anyone, his relationships with his male coworkers are considerably worse than with his female ones. In general, if a man doesn't fit his (heavily Burt Reynolds-influenced) concept of masculinity, which none of the major male characters do, he will more than likely interact with them with a combination of schoolyard bullying and indifference. By contrast, he genuinely cares about Lana, considers Pam to be his best friend, and is very tolerant of and amused by Cheryl's insanity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesLoveDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesLoveDogs">Heroes Love Dogs</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a>.

Alcohol withdrawal can be legitimately damaging to one's health, especially for someone who's been drinking as much and as long as Archer has.</li></ul></li><li> It's also heavily implied that he really does love Lana, but has no idea how to say it.</li><li> Seasons 8-10 have a lot of allusions to his subconscious for look out for the cues; for example, his rant at himself late in the <em>Dreamland</em> shows that he is apparently subconsciously aware of his tendency to become easily sidetracked from his initial goals, much to the detriment of himself and those close to him. There's also his comments to Poovey in the season finale about how seven shots to the gut are unsurvivable, "even in a parallel universe!", implying he is aware of his own grave condition and his low chances of survival.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">Hilariously Abusive Childhood</a>: Malory's parenting skills are a thing to behold. Highlights include teaching him to play Blackjack and taking all of his Halloween candy because he hit on 17, getting him drunk and then criticizing him for being unable to hold his liquor, stealing his bike to teach him a lesson about responsibility and letting him believe it was stolen. All this happened when he was around 7, by the way. To say nothing of Malory forgetting to alert his boarding school to her change of address, resulting in nine-year-old Archer spending a train journey alone and having to be picked up in tears by the police.

Expect him to hold the idiot ball multiple times in an episode. To get an idea of how badly he screws up, in the three part season 3 premiere, "Heart of Archness", Archer manages to cause a seaplane to run out of fuel thinking autopilot follows the flight plan, then when Rip Riley tries to land the plane safely in water Archer lowers the landing gear, causing the plane to crash into the water. Then on the life raft, eats all the rations before Riley wakes up, then manages to get them captured by pirates.

It doesn't matter how much of an asshole someone is to you, making potshots about them dying of a disease is <em>never</em> okay.</li><li> Archer goes on a brutal "revenge rampage" against the Irish mob his reasons are hard to argue with: The mob were knowingly using fake chemo medications to make a profit with not caring about the cancer patients who needed said medication to survive.</li><li> Though he did some legitimately dickish things during the Heart of Archness three-parter, everything that happened to them was direct result of Malory, and by extension Rip, trying to force Archer to return home.<ul><li> He was absolutely right when he explained to Rip that he didn't run away, because he's a grown man and adults can't run away. Adults can go where ever they want. While Archer maybe shouldn't have punched Rip, everything Rip did after that was kidnapping.</li><li> Considering he was being kidnapped, it was well within Archer's rights to knock Rip out. Sure he nearly got them both killed, but that is a direct result of the aforementioned kidnapping.</li><li> Lana punches Archer's lights out when she finds out he was being a pirate king voluntarily, but he wouldn't have even been in the position to do that had it not been for the aforementioned mistakes.</li></ul></li><li> Demanding Cyril to stop with the nasty comments towards Lana just because she had a baby (that wasn't his) via sperm bank and to get on with his life.</li><li> Calling out Lana for springing fatherhood on him without discussing it with him first.</li><li> Gives Lana a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a> moment for setting up a fake, dangerous spy to see if she could trust him with AJ. He takes note on her hypocrisy.</li><li> In Season 11, he gives Lana another verbal lashing for sending AJ to a boarding school in Switzerland when she's barely 5. Having gone through the same thing in his youth he's all too familiar with how traumatizing that can be for a child.</li><li> While he is overly eager to use violence as a first resort, he does make a point in season 11 that the team's newfound No Kill policy is impractical, and that in their line of work there are situations where deadly force is necessary to complete the mission.</li><li> Whether out of jealousy or just wanting to get a rise out of her, his insistence that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lana doesn't actually love Robert and is staying married him solely out of convenience</span> is later proven to be correct.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>: While he is a reckless, boisterous and impatient douchebag, he <em>does</em> have some compassion&#133; it's just buried deep down.<ul><li> His relationship with Ruth in "Placebo Effect".</li><li> Being more concerned about Cheryl's ocelot being lonely in his room, despite said ocelot just having destroyed one of his suits, which is normally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for him. In a similar vein he also sympathizes with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">shot tiger</a> in El Contador.</li><li> In "Honeypot", he, for no readily-explainable reason, helped a distraught Dominican man bury his prized rooster in the Everglades after it was killed in a chickenfight. Made all the more heartwarming when it's revealed a season later that alligators are one of his biggest fears.</li><li> In "Heart of Archness", he's much too sympathetic to actually commit any piracy.</li><li> He willingly gave up the last scubasuit without hesitation to Lana when he learns she's going to be a mom.</li><li> Telling Pam that he and the other characters liked her the way she was, and that even though her cocaine use has made her thinner and sexier, the effect it has had on her personality is undesirable and the risk of a fatal overdose is not worth it.</li><li> When it appeared that Pam was dead after taking a bullet in the chest for him, he cradles over her body and holds her hand, and yells her name in genuine anguish.</li><li> The amount of concern he shows towards Lana while she was pregnant is actually heartwarming. The instant he finds out she's expecting in "Sea Tunt: Part 2", he gives her his scuba suit, leading to him drowning and almost dying so she and the baby can be safe. He does extensive research on all possible pregnancy complications, and tells Lana to get out with the baby so they won't be separated in prison while Agent Hawley is searching the mansion. In San Marcos, when Lana's water breaks and she starts having contractions, he shows some of the most genuine fear and worry we've ever seen from him, asking her what her bishop score is and revealing he's been certified as a doula, showing how much he cares about her and the baby.</li><li> In the ending of the Season 6 opener, he uses his sat-phone to track down and call the wife of the elderly Japanese soldier he's been working with through most of the episode so they can reunite for the first time in decades.

He absolutely <em>despises</em> every last thing about his mother but he seemed to have idolized the image of his father&#133; until he learned that his dad was not who he thought he was.

Ninety-nine percent of the time Archer is a dissolute playboy with an uncommon skill at fisticuffs. However, the one percent of the time when he takes a situation seriously, it's generally a sign either that he is extremely pissed off or things have gone South big time. In "Placebo Effect", for instance, the discovery that the Irish Mob have been selling fake drugs to cancer patients &mdash; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a category which, at that point, included him and another patient he befriended</span> &mdash; was enough to get him to gleefully commit some very nasty torture. But the biggest example is in "Sitting," where he lampshades the fact that most of the time, he's half-assing everything, but when AJ is put into harm's way, he will not fuck around.</li><li> In "Deadly Prep" when he's suddenly confronted with his school bully who traumatized him and put him in the hospital, he becomes an absolute stammering mess. Even when Lana makes a "phrasing" joke, he doesn't respond. He later recounts the story of how he was mercilessly beaten and aspirated water and urine into his lungs from being drowned in a toilet. It's implied he was assaulted like this many times.
