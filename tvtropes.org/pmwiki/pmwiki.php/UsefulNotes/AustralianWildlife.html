But really, as long as you knock your shoes out every morning, and don't go poking in holes in the ground, and wear long pants with thick socks and heavy boots, and don't swim north of the Tropic of Capricorn in the wet season, and don't swim at all in the Northern Territory, and keep a forked stick handy, and an antivenine kit, and stay within a 10 minute helicopter flight of a hospital, you're perfectly safe. Most of the time.

We have poisonous toads that didn't do the job, there are the famous cute species like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangaroosRepresentAustralia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangaroosRepresentAustralia">kangaroos</a>, koalas, and wombats, a host of not-so-cute and incredibly deadly creatures, and some of the world's only egg-laying mammals, who are quite cute themselves at a safe distance. Aren't we lucky?
</p><p>Of course, living in Australia doesn't automatically mean you'll die just by stepping in 100 yards of Oceania. It's just as relatively safe as any other modern country, with slightly more caution about where you put your hands and feet. Also on the bright side, the area between and around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sydney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Melbourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Melbourne">Melbourne</a> has fewer instances of the super deadly wildlife (for example, no box jellyfish, crocodiles, dingos or taipans, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseReassurance">but it still has</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">sharks, spiders, other venomous snakes, jellyfish with painful stings and, of course, rabbits</a>). Besides, to actually stand a chance of death by Australian wildlife, one has to either completely ignore safety instructions and first aid (you will be given first aid, for example, if you get a box jellyfish/stonefish/blue ringed octopus sting at a patrolled beach or one within easy reach of ambulances), enter undisturbed bushland inadequately prepared (though there's plenty of it, "undisturbed bushland" does not include the cities, tourist areas, beaches and farmland) or both.

Indeed, when news of the platypus first reached Europe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlingPlatypus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzlingPlatypus">scientists believed it was naught but an elaborate hoax created by taxidermists sewing parts from different animals together</a>. The real kicker is that it's only one of <em>two</em> (or five, counting individual echidna species) living mammals that <em>lay eggs</em>. The male of the species also has a spur on its hind legs that delivers a potent neurotoxin. Presumably used to assert dominance over other males during the breeding season, it won't kill a human but will cause excruciating pain that can last for a long time, and can recur up to a year later. They also <a class="urllink" href="http://discovermagazine.com/2005/apr/sex-ys-platypuses0425/">have ten sex chromosomes<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gulp');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1gulp" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gulp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For reference, every other known form of life that has anything resembling sex chromosomes have between one and four of them, and most of the ones that have more than two are plants. <em>Rare</em> plants.</span> The platypus also appears on the Australian 20 cent coin.

They are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallASmeerpARabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallASmeerpARabbit">sometimes called spiny anteaters</a> for the long spines on their bodies and their primary source of food. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">They also have four-headed penises.</a> One appears on the Australian 5 cent coin. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2touv');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2touv" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2touv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One echidna, that is.</span>
</li><li> Babies of both the platypus and echidna are known as "puggles". After hatching from their reptilian-like eggs, they feed on their mother's milk which simply oozes out of the skin like sweat rather then through nipples like other mammal groups.
<ul><li> In the event of ever finding yourself having to nurse a baby platypus or echidna, just spread the formula onto the palm of your hand and get the baby to "snuffle" it up. Your hand is now a monotreme boob.

Dingoes still retain most characteristics present in wild Asian wolves, it is also highly unlikely that they were subjected to any significant form of domestication that would warrant labeling them as feral or wild dogs. The New Guinea singing dog is so closely related that they're considered the same subspecies. They are endangered from rural and hunting lobbies. Also, from a genetic viewpoint, endangered by feral dogs due to interbreeding.

It should be noted, though, that legality of ownership between states varies; some require a permit, others flat-out ban owning a dingo. Only New South Wales allows unregulated ownership.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Due to one infamous incident</a> (the Lindy Chamberlain case), Dingoes are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">known</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatsBabies">eating babies</a>.

It's worth noting that if you live in Sydney (or any of the nearby suburbs), every night you'll see thousands the flying foxes overhead, going to roost somewhere. They always move together but there are so many that the whole event usually lasts upwards of three hours, and it's a pretty phenomenal sight.
</li><li> Australia is in fact home to a <a class="urllink" href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/12/australian_murids_i.php">multitude of<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2007/12/australian_murids_ii.php">rodents<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, many of which are found nowhere else. No one cares about them because they're boring placentals, but they account for a quarter of all the mammal species in Australia. Australian rodents even form a real life example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwarmOfRats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwarmOfRats">Swarm of Rats</a>.
</li><li> Southern Ocean humpback whales migrate up the east coast to mate, give birth and generally escape the Antarctic winter. Whale watching is a <em>major</em> tourist industry in Northern NSW and most of coastal Queensland. An albino whale named Migaloo has become something of a minor celebrity in recent years. All of them are notorious for showing off when boatloads of tourists show up.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marsupials&nbsp;</div><div id="folder1" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Kangaroos
<ul><li> We all know what they look like. Giant brown / red / grey (depends on location) marsupials with massive tails, tiny arms and legs that, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> accurately described, "could disembowel you with a kick". They also appear on the 50 cent coin, with the emu. And no, males don't have pouches. And no, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooPouchRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooPouchRide">you can't ride in them</a>. Even if you ask nicely. The males are often known as "boomers", and the females as "flyers". A group of kangaroos is called a "mob", but no one has ever thought to ask why... It's possible they're called that because they've been known to lure dogs into water and then make them "sleep with the fishes".
</li><li> They're also <strong>delicious</strong> - kangaroo meat is known to make good steaks, quite similar in taste to beef, but much healthier due to an almost nonexistent fat content. It's often touted as more environmentally friendly than beef as well (since kangaroos need much less water to grow than cows and produce no methane), although the PR downsides of eating a national animal are obvious. Although less to Australians than to most nationalities - kangaroo meat is stocked by the major supermarket chains throughout Australia. Unfortunately the carving is almost universally appalling, because training to properly carve beef, lamb or pork teaches you as much about carving a creature as uniquely-shaped as a kangaroo as it does about carving ice sculptures. It's still perfectly edible, but it's a pain to cook. Still, it's worth the effort.
</li><li> Their hopping mode of travel uses less energy per weight per distance than anything science has been able to devise, with minimal need for contrarian balancing motions, that can only be used by creatures with the kangaroo's specific anatomy and only on its specific habitat of flat wide open spaces.
</li><li> Females have an unusual breeding system which manages to make this group of marsupials very successful. They have three vaginas, but only one can have a developing embryo at a time. The gestation period is very short, about 33 days. The baby enters the world as a tiny grub-like thing which then crawls from the birth canal to the pouch, where it then latches onto a nipple and continues to grow for another 4 months or so. Once it is big enough, it then comes out as a baby joey. The mother is also able to halt development of potential embryos if the pouch is occupied. This system enables a mother kangaroo to potentially have three babies at the same time in different stages of development: a joey hopping about outside, a joey developing in the pouch, and an embryo inside the uterus.

They are also surprisingly fast when need be, despite their roly-poly build. They can actually even be deadly.

The chicks are among the most superprecocial of all vertebrates. They hatch with open eyes, long claws, well developed musculature, down and a full set of flight feathers. They are completely independent from the day they hatch, able to fly, hunt, feed and recognize and escape from predators within their first few hours of life, and to add insult to injury, they can some things <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LijZbMqJCo">much better<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> than the adults who sired them. Adults do not care for their young, form breeding pairs or any other sort of social relationships. Their interactions are limited entirely to mating and very occasionally fighting over territory. The independence and innate survival knowledge of their young is baffling to scientists, and it is believed that these breeding habits may be a close reflection of those of their dinosaur ancestors as several extinct birds such as Enantiornithes <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiornithes#Life_history">behaved like this too<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, making the megapodes a strange 'missing link' for animal behaviorists.

These birds defend their nests against all intruders by calling loudly, spreading their wings, and then swooping fast and low, and where necessary striking at interlopers with their feet and attacking animals on the ground with a conspicuous yellow spur on the carpal joint of the wing. Contrary to the urban legend, the spur is not poisonous, but you still don't want to be hit by one. And they have a habit of swooping in at eye level.

Perhaps the only eagle in the world that makes the American Bald Eagle look like a pansy, the 'wedgie' is named for its distinctive wedge-shaped tail. Known for scavenging roadkill on some of the Outback's long, straight roadways, where these birds gorge on the easy meal and become so heavy they need to take off into the wind, which can set them up for head-on collisions with road-trains (think a semi-truck with upwards of a dozen trailers on it). The results are <strong>not</strong> pretty. They are the largest birds of prey in Australia, with wingspans approaching <em>three bloody metres</em> - large enough for them to fly off with newborn lambs and, so the urban legends say, the occasional unguarded child as well. The sheep-stealing trick means farmers have to shoot them to protect their flocks, so wedgies are currently just the wrong side of endangered. Which is a shame, because they are absolutely <em>magnificent</em>. Truly the kings of the Aussie sky.

Choughs tend to live in large families because raising young is a group activity and more birds to protect them gives the chicks a better chance of survival. Which means that choughs have evolved the tactic of stealing fledgling choughs from other families and raising them as their own so that there will be more birds to raise next years chicks. Also, their eyes become swollen and even <em>brighter</em> red when they get excited.

</li><li> Australian Death Adder (also, don't let the name and appearance fool you, it's not a viper, it's an elapid. The difference isn't significant when it bites you, of course, but the weirdness of a venomous snake that looks like an entire different family of venomous snakes is pretty Australian in itself.)
</li><li> Western Brown Snake
<ul><li> The details of snakes' relative deadliness is really complicated, and so no one can really agree on anything, but suffice to say that messing with Aussie snakes can easily get you killed (although it doesn't actually happen very often, since most people know to go to the hospital &mdash; which is, incidentally, free). To elaborate a bit further, Australian snakes are considered the most <em>venomous</em>, meaning their venom is the most deadly to humans. However unlike other snakes that lay claim to the title of deadliest such as the black mamba or the king cobra, the Australian snakes (with the exception of some of the taipans) are much less aggressive and only attack when provoked. Combined with most of the nastier ones being either aquatic or located in areas with very low human populations, they're simply less likely to encounter people and so cause fewer deaths. Of course, if you <em>do</em> provoke them, you will get what is coming to you.
</li></ul></li><li> Australia also has some interesting non-venomous snakes, such as the Olive Python, which is big enough to eat small crocodiles. However, it's <em>not</em> big enough to eat full-grown humans, so while it might put a painful bite on you in self-defense like any constrictor, it can't kill you.

The two best-known types are lace monitors (slightly smaller with black and yellow colouring, lives in coastal regions and forests, and what most people think of when they say "goanna") and perenties (a bit larger, mostly red-brown in colour, lives in the central deserts.) Essentially a lizard the size of a small(-ish) crocodile but lives on land. Related to Komodo dragons. Can grow over 2 metres in length, are <strong>very</strong> fast if necessary, and have been known to turn and attack humans if threatened. If bitten the wound is almost guaranteed to be infected, though recent studies suggest they may actually be venomous. Oh, and their tails are more weapon than ornament &mdash; most victims of goanna attacks are innocent bystanders who were watching and laughing...
<ul><li> Most goanna attacks are accidental. They try to escape by running up trees, but they are so short sighted they can't tell the difference between a laughing human and a tree.

</li><li> The now-likely extinct gastric-brooding frog. None have been seen since 1985, the frog uses an unusual method to protect its eggs and the tadpoles that hatch from them: IT EATS THEM! The mother frog will eat the eggs as soon as they're laid and will carry her young in her stomach until they're frogs, at which point they climb out of her mouth! Scientists have recently concluded that the eggs and tadpoles were secreting a coating that counter-acted the stomach acids of their mother and would have been valuable in research on stomach ulcers.
<ul><li> Not to worry about the medical research thing though. We already got a Nobel Prize for discovering that stomach ulcers are caused by <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and can be treated with a simple course of antibiotics. Hooray for Drs. Warren and Marshall.

This spider will actually chase you and try to bite you again. Also able to bite through a toenail.
<ul><li> The funnelweb was the inspiration to revert the Black Tiger from a tarantula in later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a> games. They've also begun popping up in other states, with at least two sightings in Tasmania. They're harder to kill than cane toads as well, you'd better be armed like Chris or Jill should you encounter one.

<ul><li> The nice thing about the funnelweb is that it lives all over the eastern coast of New South Wales, and just <em>loves</em> to camp out in your room, under your bed, or hey, even in your bed. They're not fussy.
</li><li> Plus, the bastards swim. Showers become terrifying ordeals after hearing horror stories about them coming up through the pipes.

<ul><li> Even though its venom isn't dangerous, it manages to indirectly kill people by sleeping under the sun visors in their cars, falling onto the drivers' laps and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">distracting</a> them.

It's not really an insect or an arachnid, but there wasn't a section about worms. The Giant Gippsland Earthworm (<em>Megascolides australis</em>) is giant earthworm from Gippsland, in Victoria. They average about 1m (over 3 feet) in length but big ones can be 3m (nearly 10 feet) long. They can also make themselves longer or shorter, because they're worms. Unlike many Australian creatures they're not dangerous. They just do worm stuff. But they do it on a large scale.

The stinger has the ability to pierce through a thick layer of protective clothing. Its stinger is also used like a freaking harpoon! There is <em>no antivenom</em>, and even if one existed it would be pointless because it couldn't be administered fast enough to do any good &mdash; <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conotoxin">conotoxin<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> is basically <em>nerve gas</em>, destroying the nervous system faster than nerves can transmit the sensation of being stung. Victims <em>drop dead instantly without even realizing they've been stung.</em>
<ul><li> On the bright side, its venom is being studied for medical properties. As in, nonaddictive painkillers thousands of times more potent than morphine.

When threatened, pretty iridescent blue markings appear. Extremely venomous, and has killed several people.
<ul><li> The blue-ringed octopus and the cone shell have the same type of venom; it paralyses you and stops your breathing, letting you quietly suffocate. This venom, known as tetrodotoxin, is approximately 1,200 times more toxic than cyanide. If you get bitten by one, your only hope is that someone realises what's happened and commences CPR and rescue breathing; you will need to either be hooked up to advanced life support or given continuous CPR for the next twenty-four hours. After that time, with a lot of luck, the venom will have left your body without doing any permanent damage.
</li><li> Sharing the waters with the blue-ringed octopus is another adorable and possibly venomous cephalopod, <em>Sepioloidea lineolata</em>, or <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepioloidea_lineolata">the striped pyjama squid<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

<ul><li> So another solution to these unwanted camels is selling them to countries that do want them. Such as <em>Saudi Arabia</em>. Yes, we sell camels to the Middle East, doncha love this country?
</li><li> Notable also because Australia's dromedaries (the country also has some Bactrian camels, and an even smaller number of dromedary&#150;Bactrian hybrids) are the only ones in the world that exhibit wild behaviour, despite them being non-indigenous.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107w1w');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note107w1w" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107w1w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The truly wild dromedary is widely accepted to have been extinct for at least 2,000 years. A small and critically endangered population of wild Bactrian camels exists in Asia.</span> Also, possibly adding to our perceived barbarism is the movement to have camel become a staple of our national cuisine. It isn't working all that well. Which is unfortunate because it's <em>delicious.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Unlike most of the introduced/feral species on this list, Camels manage to fulfill an environmental niche without severely upsetting the native species. They tend to eat plants that native species won't touch and their soft-padded feet makes soil erosion less likely (Unlike the Brumbies below). It has even been suggested that they could be a replacement for the herbivorous megafauna that used to exist in Australia before they went extinct. However, their biggest issue is the fact that there isn't a naturally occurring predator to keep populations in check, hence the need for culling.
</li></ul></li><li> Brumbies (feral horses).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Rabbits</a>.
</li><li> Pigs ('Razorbacks').
<ul><li> Australia has famously managed to produce wild/feral pigs that are even larger than domestic pigs. Unfortunately, they're also horribly aggressive. Fortunately, they're edible.
</li></ul></li><li> Goats.
</li><li> Water buffalo.
</li><li> Cats.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode">No, seriously</a>, feral cats in Australia play the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatsAreMean">Cats Are Mean</a> trope straight; they breed almost like rabbits, eat native wildlife (they are blamed for some species extinctions since European settlement and they occasionally kill and eat even pets and poultry) and can be aggressive towards humans.
</li></ul></li><li> Dogs.
<ul><li> Luckily, rabies is not present in Australia, thus surviving dog/cat/fox/dingo bites in Australia will not carry a rabies risk. Also, the absence of rabies makes feral dogs less aggressive.
</li></ul></li><li> Indian Mynah birds - brown feathers, yellow beaks. Aggressively territorial, these birds drive native birds out of their habitats by ganging up and chasing them. Distinct from Noisy Miners, which are grey, native, and a <em>little</em> calmer in disposition.
<ul><li> The birds were introduced into the country to control the population of certain insects, but we can see how that went...
</li><li> If you stay in Australia for a month, particularly in the suburbs, you will want to grab a shotgun and shoot the whiners down.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Rabbits</a>.
<ul><li> We're not kidding. The things are a noxious pest, destroying much of the above unique wildlife, and we've tried everything from continent-spanning fences to germ warfare to kill them off. Apparently they eventually grew immune to the introduced rabbit virus; scientists are currently making a new one. Some breeding programs for dingoes involve teaching them to favour eating rabbits above native species.
</li><li> To give you an idea of how prolific rabbits are, and how much they breed, the current infestation of rabbits started with the release of twelve rabbits in 1859. Within ten years hunters could shoot or trap over <em>two million</em> of the buggers annually without having any noticeable effect. When they first used the aforementioned germ warfare in 1950, the population was around <em>600 million</em>. In less than a hundred years, 12 became half a billion. They say "breeding like rabbits" for a reason.
</li><li> The Australian hatred for rabbits was well-known as early as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a> short story "What Goes Up" (collected in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesFromTheWhiteHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesFromTheWhiteHart">Tales from the White Hart</a></em>) has some Australian scientists try a dangerous experiment with rabbits as test subjects before having a human handle it. The narrator of the story (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameStory">an Englishman in a London pub</a>) comments that "as scientists, they'd be pleased if their subjects got back alive; and as Australians they'd be just as happy if they got back dead... (You know, of course, how Australians feel about rabbits)."
</li></ul></li><li> In some areas, camphor laurel (a fragrant tree from China) grows rampant and competes heavily with native trees. It is also very toxic for the native birds. But at least it can be used for everything from furniture to firewood to power for a sugar mill.
</li><li> In these same areas another weed called lantana grows with the same consequences, but is much harder to kill/use, as it is in fact a very gangly bush that grows large. Actually cultivated as a beautiful garden plant in Victoria, proving that Australia can be even more badass then itself. So at least it's being controlled in some way.
</li><li> The blackberry, oh <em>god</em> the blackberry. Tell any Victorian farmer that it is a beautiful plant that should be protected, farmed and loved, and he will either viciously insult you, your mother, and your grandmother or kick your ass (it is a good idea to wear a suit of armor, as you <em>will</em> need it). Or both.
<ul><li> Of course, if you're dealing with blackberry brambles you should probably be wearing a suit of armor anyway, but at least they're edible.
</li></ul></li><li> Same goes for the prickly pear, or at least it used to. Ever since the introduction of the cactoblastus moth, whose grubs parasitise them, they're become more or less part of the landscape; lone cacti scattered across the countryside. Quite a step down from the days when they could grow in tightly-woven forests that could spread for <em>miles</em> without an inch of space. The sad thing is, the success with the cactoblastus may have been what gave people the idea to bring in cane toads in the first place...
</li><li> European Carp. Known as "the rabbits of the waterways" - so that's "rabbits" again, sort of.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.northwestweeds.nsw.gov.au/tiger_pear.htm">Tiger Pear<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. How does a foot-high, tough-as-koala-shit cactus that grows inch-long barbed spines <em>that can penetrate a truck tyre</em>[sic] grab you? Seriously, check out the photos, then imagine treading on one. The barbs means they don't come out, either.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://aussiewannabe.com/files/toadzilla.jpg">cane toad.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> Easily one of, if not <em>the</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">most hated creatures in Australia</a>, particularly by Queenslanders. First introduced to try and destroy the cane beetles devastating sugar cane crops. Somehow, those introducing them didn't notice that the beetles lived up high and Cane Toads can't climb. Remember that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Simpsons</a></em> episode where they go to Australia and Bart leaves his frog at the airport, only for it to hop away and devastate the Australian crops and countryside in the time it took for the show's story to finish? Yeah, that's more or less real.
<ul><li> One advert a while back features cane toads being used as golf balls by drunken Queenslanders, hitting them over the New South Wales border fence, and promptly being chased off by border patrol. It was a beer ad, mind.
</li><li> People who <em>aren't</em> drunk use cricket bats. They're also good for hockey practice.
</li><li> Other methods include blowing them up with air pumps<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11ontx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note11ontx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11ontx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">may cause memories of Shrek blowing up the toad in the movie of the same name for non-Australians reading this article or tourists who get to see the activity</span>, feeding them paracetamol (apparently it swells their insides) and running them over with any vehicle to hand.
</li><li> Also, squirting them with Dettol (a strong antiseptic), which poisons them pretty quickly.
</li><li> Don't forget blowing them up with smuggled firecrackers in their mouths.
</li><li> It's practically a national duty to swerve to run over as many of them as you can rather than dodge.
</li><li> It's also a fun summer activity for anybody under the age of about 15, 'toading' (the activity in their breeding season of killing absolutely as many as you can in a time limit. Not as hilariously cruel, but definitely more pragmatic) is practically a national children's pastime. Common weapons include: Cricket bats, golf clubs, broom handles with nails in them, cans of deodorant with cigarette lighters, tubs of salt, gumboots (a.k.a "Wellingtons" if you're from the UK or "rainboots" if you're American or Canadian), bricks, <em>other toads</em>...
</li><li> The RSCPA recommends that people humanely kill them by capturing them and placing them in the freezer, but no sane Australian is going to do <em>that</em>.
</li><li> Worse, these things are very difficult to kill. They make cockroaches look delicate. You can run these things over on a ride-on mower, have them go under the front wheels, have them get CAUGHT IN THE BLADES, have them go under the back wheels because you could and the thing will just sit there like, "Oh I'm sorry. Was that supposed to kill me?"
<ul><li> As one can see from the above, Australians <em>detest them</em>, possibly more than rabbits, since rabbits are very much on the loser's end of the food chain, and can be eaten by everything under the sun, including humans. They're fairly harmless as individuals, non-aggressive and easy to kill, so because of their speed they even make fun target practice. With cane toads, the eggs, tadpoles and adults are <em>all</em> poisonous. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuProofMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KungFuProofMook">Some of the native crows</a> have learnt to flip them over and eat their non-toxic guts. Sadly, not enough. Cane Toads are fairly slow, so they aren't even much good for wasting bullets on target practice either. Don't even touch them with your bare skin.
</li><li> Look at some of the above examples (especially in the Insects and Reptiles category) and think about this a minute... someone managed to find an invasive species too poisonous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooSpicyForYogSothoth">for Australia!</a></em> Or more specifically, a poisonous species that Australia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">wasn't used to</a>, the little bastards being invasive and all.
</li><li> Interesting note: 102 cane toads were originally introduced into Australia. It's now estimated that there are over 200 million here.
</li></ul></li><li> To better highlight how crazy Australians are; some conservationists began pushing for people to start <em>eating</em> cane toads, because the flesh is as edible as any other frog or toads if properly prepared.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12kl1l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note12kl1l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12kl1l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">avoid the poison glands, remove the skin, rinse twice in salt water.</span> Of course, if improperly prepared, it'll kill you, so talk about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochistsMeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasochistsMeal">Masochist's Meal</a>. Even better, the idea actually <em>caught on</em>, to the point those same conservationists then had to start trying to dissuade people from preparing their own toad-meat and getting themselves killed.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverusedRunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverusedRunningGag">Oh, and did we mention rabbits?</a>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder8');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plants&nbsp;</div><div id="folder8" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Eucalyptus trees (genus <em>Eucalyptus</em>), or gum trees to the lay person, is an amazingly strong hardwood. So strong, in fact, it can be used to shatter cinderblocks. They can even survive bush fires - bush fires even play a role in the reproductive cycle of some species! - unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">they</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">explode</a>.
<ul><li> They're also responsible for how fast fires can spread. On hot days they release eucalyptus oil into the air that makes things appear blue from a distance (this is how the Blue Mountains west of Sydney got their name). It's also highly flammable in such a form and can ignite from radiant heat alone and makes it easy for it to jump fire breaks. They also have a habit of all shedding their very dry leaves at once, carpeting a forest with kindling.
</li><li> That explosion note is not hyperbole, either. During bushfires, the sap of some eucalypts can heat and expand inside the trunk. Contents under pressure takes it course, and "explode" is exactly the right word - apart from the ear-splitting boom, it sends flaming wooden shrapnel everywhere.
</li><li> While all eucalypts are related there is a truly ridiculous variety of them. Some of the varieties are names for where they grow (the snow gum which is the variety that can withstand the snowfields of Victoria, Southern New South Wales and Tasmania) or their appearance (the pale ghost gum), but many are named after the properties of their bark. Ironbarks and stringybarks to name but two and even these aren't single species but groups of several similar types.
</li><li> Note also that some varieties have the habit of dropping substantial branches off during the dry season. These branches are heavy enough to crush the roof of a car or your skull, so even the <em>trees</em> in Australia are dangerous.
</li><li> To the vast majority of animals, the sap of the eucalyptus tree is toxic and lethal to ingest. The exception is the koala, which has adapted to the point that the sap drugs them instead of killing them.
</li></ul></li><li> Macadamias (genus <em>Macadamia</em>). Nut-bearing trees that are commercially cultivated. The nuts are popular but their shells are notoriously tough and if you plan to crack them on your own, you're going to need a hammer.
</li><li> Golden Wattle. A type of <em>Acacia</em> and the floral emblem of Australia with little, fuzzy yellow buds that flower in late winter. It can be made into flour with a sweeter taste than the wheat kind - meaning all four living parts of the Australian crest are edible.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">This here's the wattle, the emblem of our land. You can stick it in a bottle, you can hold it in your hand.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Bottlebrushes (genus <em>Callistemon</em>). A whole group of plants with flowers that come in the shape of bottle brushes, hence the name. Bees and nectar-feeding birds <em>love</em> them; a common sight in summer wherever they grow is a flock of wild lorikeets climbing all over the bush to sip the nectar (and, on occasion, getting roaringly drunk because the nectar has fermented into an intoxicant, which sees them falling headlong out of the bush, waddling in dizzy circles and slamming into windows when trying to fly. This also happens with some types of fruit).
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksia">Banksia.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em> A diverse genus of spectacular flowers, 90% of which are endemic to Western Australia. Closely related to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">nearly-as-spectacular</a> <em>Protea</em> species of South Africa, as well as the aforementioned <em>Macadamia</em>, and distantly related to sycamores (plane-trees) and lotuses for those of you in the G-8 countries.
</li><li> Grasstrees (genus <em>Xanthorrhoea</em>). A group of slow growing trees with long slender leaves that look like grass and many have a long spike growing from the middle that contains seed buds. Like gum trees and many <em>Banksias</em>, they not only can survive bushfires but actually require fire to open their seed pods.
<ul><li> Often called "black boys" for the very black trunk of the tree. Now considered racist towards the indigenous peoples, the name is only used in casual conversation, and then only rarely.
</li><li> <em>Kingia australis</em> looks similar to the degree it was once considered the 'female form' of grasstrees. However, the plants are completely unrelated and differ in the construction of their 'trunks'.
</li></ul></li><li> Wollemi Pine (<em>Wollemia nobilis</em>). Considered a Lazarus taxon (oldest known fossil from the genus is about 200 million years old, and it disappeared from the fossil record about 30 million years ago, before its rediscovery in 1994) and originally restricted to a small canyon in New South Wales but now being cultivated in a wide variety of locations. It is <em>not</em> a true pine (genus <em>Pinus</em>), though it is a conifer and hence distantly related. The only known population of wild <em>Wollemia</em> (consisting of about 100 trees) is in the Blue Mountains, in three closely located groups, with the exact locations kept a secret.
</li><li> Triodia, aka Spinifex (not to be confused with the genus <em>Spinifex</em>) is a grass tipped with hard silicate arrowheads that break off in your skin. In any other country, the fact that the <em>grass</em> wants to hurt/kill/maim you would be near the top of the weirdness pile. In Australia, it's barely the tip of the dangerous wildlife iceberg.
</li><li> Gympie Gympie (<em>Dendrocnide moroides</em>) or Stinging Tree, so named because it is a tree which will sting you. All parts of Gympie Gympie other than the roots is covered with tiny hairs that pierce the skin and inject a neurotoxin. This neurotoxin is so powerful and painful that it is also referred to as The Suicide Plant. It has been known to kill dogs, humans and horses through shock. Some have also killed themselves, with horses throwing themselves off cliffs and one army officer reported to have shot himself. If the hairs are not removed they can keep stinging for up to a year, and the recommended procedure for removing them is to douse them in hydrochloric acid and then use a waxing strip. Even if removed, the symptoms can persist for months or years, and recur for years afterwards. The hairs can also still sting even if the specimen has been dead and dried for up to 100 years. Did I mention it can also be inhaled? It can. Forestry workers in areas where the Gympie Gympie grows carry respirators, wear thick clothes and gloves, and carry anti-hysthamines and cyanide capsules (that last one's not true). Apparently the fruit is edible if you can get all the hairs off it.
