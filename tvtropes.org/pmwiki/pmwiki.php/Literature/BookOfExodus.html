happens, God's Law provides such a person protection from the "avenger of blood" by having the person responsible for the accidental death remain in a designated "city of refuge" until the case is fully examined and also until the death of the high priest, to make sure that there's no intended malice on the part of the one responsible for the death toward the victim. Three such cities were set up on the east side of the Jordan in the territory occupied by the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the eastern half of Manasseh, while three more cities were set up on the other side in the land of Canaan occupied by the other nine-and-a-half tribes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccompliceByInaction">Accomplice by Inaction</a>: In Numbers chapter 30, if a woman makes a vow while in her father's house or married to a husband, and the father or husband hears the vow being made but says nothing, then by his silence he confirms the woman's vow and causes it to stand, but if on the day he hears the vow he annuls it, then everything that she had vowed will not stand, and the Lord will forgive her. However, if the father or husband makes void the vow sometime after she has made it (outside of his hearing about it), then he must bear the penalty for breaking it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: Moses' brother Aaron <em>always</em> has most of his deeds taken over by Moses himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>:<ul><li> The Pharaoh commands that the baby boys of the Hebrews must be killed, even when they are born. This leads to Moses' parents sending their child away in a floating basket in the hopes that he would be spared.</li><li> In Deuteronomy chapter 28, God says as part of the curse for not obeying His commands that His people's children will be taken away as captives, and the parents' eyes will fail them as they long for their children's return.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionReport">After-Action Report</a>: According to tradition, these books were written near the end of Moses' and Joshua's lifetimes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllFlyersAreBirds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllFlyersAreBirds">All Flyers Are Birds</a>: In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList">Long List</a> of laws detailing what animals are and are not OK to eat, <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qd27');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0qd27" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qd27');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Interestingly, no plants or fungi are considered to be unclean.

Anyway, the lack of unclean vegetables and fruit becomes important later in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfDaniel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfDaniel">Book of Daniel</a>, when the Jews are exiled in Babylon (which does not abide by these rules).

As for bats, it is now known that the consumption of fruit bats in Africa <em>has</em> been linked to the transmission of Ebola and related viruses. Again, a way of keeping people healthy (and thus keeping communicable diseases at bay) by declaring certain types of meat and ways of handling/preparing/serving it off limits. </span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Either this distinction wasn't known in those days</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">"birds" was a catch-all term for all vertebrates that could fly</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">And There Was Much Rejoicing</a>: The Israelites waste no time singing praises to the Lord when they see that the Pharaoh and his army was killed by the flood of waters that God unleashes on them after the Israelites safely cross through the Red Sea.

The Egyptians nevertheless were so annoyed they couldn't stop hitting it, ending with the whole Egypt being inundated.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldWomen">Bald Women</a>: In the book of Deuteronomy, if an Israelite soldier takes townspeople captive (as long as they aren't Canaanites, who were to be exterminated), and he sees a woman he's attracted to, after the war is over, if he still wants to be with her, he can take her as a concubine or a wife. Part of that meant shaving her head, trimming her nails, and getting rid of her old clothes. This was done for multiple reasons: one, it helped erase her cultural attachments; if she was to be his concubine, she'd have to convert to his religion and assimilate his cultural practices. Two, it was also a good way to avoid transmitting diseases and parasites. And three, in many cultures of the area, including Israelite culture, shaving one's head was a sign of mourning, and she would be allowed a month to mourn her parents/friends/neighbors/culture/old gods/husband/etc. After that, she would become his, and should he then decide he didn't want her anymore, he was to let her go free, and was not allowed to sell her into slavery.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnAGreatBigLie">Based on a Great Big Lie</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">Depends who you ask</a>.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">the ancient Egyptians never recorded their defeats and turned some of them into victories</a>. It's believed that there's a historical core to the story since one of the oldest poems in the book titled "The Song of the Sea" is dated to the 12th century BC. These are two of various reasons why even scholars who aren't members of the Abrahamic faiths think there must have been a exodus (or several of them) of some sort whether or not it happened in the grander, supernaturally-enabled way the Bible describes it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseISaidSo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseISaidSo">Because I Said So</a>: Invoked many times by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>, or by leaders like Moses and later kings, who would claim that the edicts were issued directly by God.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetLadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedsheetLadder">Bedsheet Ladder</a>: In Joshua chapter 2, Rahab helps the two Israelite spies escape Jericho by letting them down the wall of the city with a scarlet cord tied to her window.

Aaron tells them to give him their gold, so they did, and he melts the gold, fashions it into a golden calf, and calls it their god (or God). The one true God brings this to Moses' attention, and when he sees the people worshiping the calf with pagan revelry, he got so mad that he broke the tablets containing the Ten Commandments, and he also crushed and ground the golden calf to powder. He had those involved in the worship of the golden calf (except for Aaron his brother) be slain before the Lord to get rid of those that would worship other gods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFilibuster">Character Filibuster</a>: The first thirty-three chapters of Deuteronomy make up Moses's final, longest testament to the people of Israel, summing up their history in the forty years after the Exodus and all the laws God has given them.

Eventually, his father-in-law Jethro berates him for this, pointing out that he's not serving the people well by exhausting himself.

(In theory, if she had an affair <em>after</em> the wedding, her lover(s) could face execution as well...though in practice, it wasn't always enforced equally.) She would be considered to have cheated on her husband before they'd even met, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyHonor">her family would be forever shamed</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a>:<ul><li> Moses was 80 when he was called to bring out God's people Israel from Egypt, and 120 when he died.

Achan, out of his own personal greed, pays no attention to the curse and takes a Babylonian garment from the ruins of the city, and thus plagues the camp of Israel with a curse that is only lifted when Achan, his whole family, and all that he owned were put to death and buried in the Valley of Achor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadGuyOnDisplay">Dead Guy on Display</a>: Deuteronomy 21:22-23 states: "If a man has committed a sin deserving of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree, his body shall not remain overnight on the tree, but you shall surely bury him that day, so that you do not defile the land which the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance; for he who is hanged is accursed of God." This law was given so that the nation of Israel would not behave like the other nations in regard to their treatment of criminals deserving death. This was actually carried out by the Israelites during their conquest of the land of Canaan in the book of Joshua.

Do you intend to kill me as you did the Egyptian?", Moses ended up becoming a fugitive in the land of Midian for forty years.

Deuteronomy, chapter 22 for example, demands the death penalty for various forms of sex outside marriage, but notably clears the woman if rape is proven (she was heard crying for help) or assumed (there's no way to prove she <em>wasn't</em> crying for help), making this a slight yet notable aversion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a>: Whenever the people of Israel are in need, God provides.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes">Does Not Like Shoes</a>:<ul><li> God in the burning bush.

For this act of cowardice, God punishes them by having them wander around the wilderness for forty years until everyone that is twenty years and older (save for Joshua and Caleb) had died off, leaving only their children to be the ones who will enter the Promised Land. A group of them try to go in to conquer the land themselves after being told God's judgment against them, but without God's protection, they were chased away by the Canaanites.</li><li> Before that, in Exodus, God chose to bring His people into the Promised Land by a longer route through the Red Sea and the desert, since with the shortest route there being through the Philistine territory, God didn't want the Israelites to have this in mind when confronted with war and turn tail and head back to Egypt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScryVsScry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScryVsScry">Scry vs. Scry</a>: Moses against Pharaoh's priests.

For Israelite priests, they can only marry virgins: no divorced women, no widows, no women who lost their virginity, and no prostitutes. Also, when an Israelite man marries a woman and then finds something displeasing about her, accusing her of not being a virgin, the woman's father must produce evidence that his daughter was a virgin or else she would be stoned for "playing the harlot" in her father's house. Finally, when the Israelites went to war with Midian in the book of Numbers and brought back plunder, they were told to slay the women who have "known a man by lying with him" and to keep alive only the women who have "not known a man" (i.e., virgins).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">War God</a>: Moses describes God as such in his song on Exodus 15:3.<div class="indent"><em>The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIsYourXNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIsYourXNow">Where Is Your X Now?</a>: Invoked by God Himself in Moses' song in Deuteronomy 32:36-38, as a taunt against His own people:<div class="indent"><em>For the Lord will judge His people,</em></div><div class="indent"><em>and relent in regard to His servants,</em></div><div class="indent"><em>when He sees that their power is gone</em></div><div class="indent"><em>and there is no one left, whether restrained or free.</em></div><div class="indent"><em>He will say: Where are their gods,</em></div><div class="indent"><em>their rock in whom they trusted,</em></div><div class="indent"><em>which ate the fat of their sacrifices</em></div><div class="indent"><em>and drank the wine of their drink offerings?</em></div><div class="indent"><em>Let them rise up and help you</em></div><div class="indent"><em>and be your protection.</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWoman">Widow Woman</a>: From Exodus 22:22-24:<div class="indent"><em>You shall not afflict any widow or orphan.
