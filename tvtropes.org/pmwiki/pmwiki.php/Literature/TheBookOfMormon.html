The Book of Mormon is the main piece of holy/'god-given' writ that distinguishes Mormonism from Catholicism and the various Protestant sects, and the unofficial name of the religion, Mormonism, derives its name from the book. The Mormons regard the book as divine scripture equal to the Bible in importance. In the 1980s the church added the subtitle "Another Testament of Jesus Christ" to help clarify that the primary subject of the book is the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><hr><h1>Context</h1><p>The book claims to be an accumulation of the writings of a people descended from Israelites who immigrated to the Americas around 600 BC. The eponymous Mormon and his son Moroni, the last prophet/scholars of their people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">edited and compiled</a> the majority of the book from numerous existing texts, inscribing the final record on sheets of gold-colored metal or 'Golden Plates' in a script based on Egyptian Hieroglyphs.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note067rr');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note067rr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note067rr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which, despite the discovery of the Rosetta Stone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">General Bonaparte</a>'s troops during his Egyptian campaign, had yet to be 'cracked' during Mr Smith's lifetime.</span> Moroni, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">last survivors of his civilization</a>, buried the plates around AD 420 with the promise from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> that they would one day be brought forth again.</p><p>Joseph Smith, a young farmer in upstate New York, claimed that in 1820 Moroni appeared to him as an Angel and led him to where the plates were buried. Joseph Smith, with the aid of an artifact also delivered with the plates called the "Urim and Thummim," was blessed with the power to translate the text into English and dictated the contents to a scribe. The Book of Mormon was published in 1830 and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formed shortly thereafter under Joseph Smith's leadership. The claim of divine aid in bringing forth the book has made it a controversial subject ever since.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The book's actual contents don't get discussed much outside of Mormon circles&mdash;most non-Mormons find its origin story so outlandish that they dismiss the book as an obvious fabrication without the need to read its text.</p><p>There have been some changes to the text since the first edition. The earliest and most extensive changes were made by Smith himself in later editions.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1atf1');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1atf1" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1atf1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The original manuscript as written by the scribe Oliver Cowdery did not have any punctuation, various printers' manuscripts by different individuals had inconsistencies of punctuation, spelling, and grammar, and sometimes factual mistakes (like switching the name of who was talking). Early editions were formatted like a regular novel; numbered verses like in the Bible were added later.</span> Modern editions after Joseph Smith's death have made minor changes in the text itself but have been mostly restricted to chapter headings, footnotes, and other study helps. Critics of the book have claimed that major revisions have been made to make the text more appealing to modern audiences.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p></p><h1>Content</h1><p>In structure, the Book of Mormon resembles the 'historical books' of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, being divided into a number of books which largely form a narrative, which is punctuated by accounts of sermons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorFilibuster">editorial commentary</a>. It begins with a few families in Jerusalem, follows their journey across the ocean to a new "promised land" in the Americas, and then tells the history of the nations founded by their descendants, with emphasis on the preaching of the prophets, the spiritual condition of the cultures, and various events like several major wars.</p><p>Also included is the visit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus Christ</a>, who appears to the people after his resurrection, teaches them, and founds his church and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia">Utopia</a>. Unfortunately, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">doesn't last</a>; after several centuries, the people become wicked and divided again, and eventually a whole nation is destroyed. At this point, the last few prophets (Mormon and Moroni, as already discussed) add their last comments and bury the book.</p><p>The narrative switches between firsthand transcribed accounts of the events and summations as done by Mormon to get to the heart of the story. Books are mostly named after their primary historical author, but due to the vast number of individuals involved and the need to simplify, this doesn't always hold true. As such the Book of Omni, only a few pages long, is actually minor contributions from a half dozen writers, and Alma, the namesake of the longest book, is absent through the last third (it continues until all of Alma's <em>sons</em> have died, a pattern continued in the book of Helaman).</p><p>There are several dominant and recurring themes in the book. Some are theological, like the divinity of Christ, or that those blessed by God can sin and lose those blessings, while those who sin can repent and be blessed. Other themes involve the idea of liberty and choice, secret societies, and perhaps most prominently individual and national pride, which leads to the destruction of multiple nations.</p><p></p><hr><p>This page is about the tropes used in the The Book of Mormon itself, not about determining its authenticity or spiritual value. This is simply tropes that were <em>recognized</em> and whether or not these existed at the time of translation/writing or not is not any Troper's problem.</p><p>For more information on the church itself and other historical details see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mormonism">Useful Notes: Mormonism</a>.</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Should not be mistaken with the musical</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheBookOfMormon">The Book of Mormon</a></em>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>The Book of Mormon provides examples of...</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - M&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>:<ul><li> After Nephi makes a record of his life on metal plates, he then makes a second set of plates and writes a shorter account, leaving out a lot of history and just focusing on God's involvement. He passes both sets down to his descendants and has them follow the same pattern, to the point where some of them just announce their names but have nothing further to add to the small plates, because there wasn't any new preaching or prophesying that wasn't already covered.</li><li> Several times, Mormon states that he can't include even "a hundredth part" of the historical records he has access to.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: The Jaredites are said to have domesticated horses, donkeys, elephants, cureloms, and cumoms.

Some non-LDS scholars use the footnotes and index published by the LDS church because of their completeness and quality. Of note is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide">pronunciation guide</a> was only developed in the 1970s, as beforehand different regions had different ways of reading the many different names.

The Book of Mosiah was largely split into three timeframes among different cultures, their stories merging together at the end.

The chapter ends more optimistically, though, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">his conclusion</a> being that he'll be ok by relying on God.</li><li> Alma wishes he had the power of an angel so that he could preach repentance to the whole world, feeling dissatisfied with the limited impact he's having as a mere mortal.

After getting up to a lot of anti-church mischief, he is rebuked by an angel, goes into a "deep sleep" and has visions of God. When he wakes up days later, he has had a change of heart. He later explains to his son that he spent that time being tormented by the realisation that his actions had led people away from God and put their souls at risk.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiquatedLinguistics">Antiquated Linguistics</a>: The book's language resembles the Jacobean English found in the King James Bible, which was written almost 200 years prior.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">Armor Is Useless</a>: Averted. Several times during the wars of Captain Moroni's time it's mentioned that the Nephites tend to wear some sort of armor while the Lamanites usually don't, and this is usually mentioned right behind divine assistance as being instrumental in their victories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>: Lehi sends his sons back to Jerusalem to bring Ishmael's family along (including at least five daughters). Technically the boys and girls might still have had a choice of exactly how they paired off, but it doesn't seem to have taken them long; after returning to Lehi, all four sons plus Zoram were married before breaking camp.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Arson, Murder, and Jaywalking</a>: The Liahona and the Urim and Thummim are holy relics that God gave to his prophets to aid in their tasks. The Golden Plates were made by man but contain all of God's revelations to His people. The Sword of Laban, on the other hand, was once used to kill a man who was blackout drunk. Doing so was necessary to obtain the Brass Plates, the precursor to the Golden Plates, but the preservation of the Sword of Laban as a holy relic along with the Liahona, Urim and Thummim, and Golden Plates is never explained.

Never mind that at the time, Amalickiah was leading an invading army to conquer the Nephites and drink the blood of their leader. Or that Amalickiah was in that position because he murdered his way to the throne and then used a propaganda campaign to start a war that even the Lamanites initially didn't want.

Eventually, the Nephites are destroyed, save those who sided with the Lamanites, which brings another Apostasy for centuries to come.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonerExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonerExchange">Prisoner Exchange</a>: Subverted; it's discussed extensively, but we never actually see one happen.<ul><li> Moroni and Ammoron negotiate to exchange prisoners, but things break down because they can't stand each other.

Their waypoint, the land of Bountiful, was pretty sweet too.</li><li> Nephi is warned to take whoever will listen and leave the family's initial settlement to avoid escalating tensions with his brothers. The "land of Nephi" that they come to must have been pretty good, because it later becomes the Lamanite capital, and a group of Nephites is willing to risk war and/or enslavement to go back to it.</li><li> Mosiah is warned, again, to leave the land of Nephi with whoever will go, and they find the land of Zarahemla, where a substantial nation welcomes them with open arms and promptly makes Mosiah their king.</li><li> The Jaredites are similarly promised the Americas, but they wipe themselves out a few centuries after Lehi's family arrives, without previously coming in contact.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>: Gadianton escapes arrest and execution by evacuating promptly after his hitman doesn't return fast enough - and he apparently didn't wait very long.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousRussianRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousRussianRoulette">Religious Russian Roulette</a>: This is treated as both a positive and negative thing, depending on the asker's attitude.<ul><li> Korihor says he'll believe in God if He shows him a sign.

Both of them collapse, but unlike Sherem, they're being overcome with joy, and wake up later totally converted to the gospel.</li><li> Moroni invites the reader to ask God whether the book is true and expect an answer, so long as they ask "with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ," and preferably after contemplating God's blessings.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">Rousing Speech</a>: Captain Moroni rallying his people to defend themselves from the Lamanite army <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon/Alma#46:23">[1]<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelectiveObliviousness">Selective Obliviousness</a>: Laman and Lemuel don't seem to understand that they should stop messing with Nephi even after an angel appears in front of them and tells them to knock it off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>:<ul><li> Ether prophesies that if the king Coriantumr doesn't repent, then he will be the last survivor of the Jaredites. Part of the reason that Coriantumr (after beginning to come to his senses) is unable to stop the Jaredites' final battle is that his opponent has heard of the prophecy and wants to disprove it.</li><li> Laman and Lemuel don't understand their father's visions and prophecies, so Nephi asks them whether they've asked God for help. They reply that they haven't, because "the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us." (Given that Nephi has literally just returned from asking God for an explanation of his father's visions, and being answered with an even more expansive vision of his own along with extensive commentary, his evident frustration with his brothers is understandable.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">Sequel Hook</a>:<ul><li> Lehi prophesies that the brass plates will go to all of his descendants and never be "dimmed by time". However, by the end of the book, they are presumably buried by Mormon along with the other records he had, leaving the fulfillment of this prophecy to the future.</li><li> More generally, many parts of the Book of Mormon are written in anticipation of the last days, when the book would be found and published.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowSomeLeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowSomeLeg">Show Some Leg</a>: The people of Limhi, when they decide to stop running from the pursuing Lamanite army and surrender, send their daughters forward to plead their case. The Lamanites are charmed enough to stop attacking and listen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">Sibling Rivalry</a>: After the chief judge Pahoran dies, three of his sons compete to inherit the position. The eldest wins the popular vote, but then the youngest rebels, and is arrested and executed for treason. The youngest brother's supporters then assassinate the eldest brother in revenge, leaving the middle brother in the judgement seat. But with all the internal struggle, they haven't maintained their defences properly, and the Lamanites come along, capture the city, and kill the judge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverTongue">Silver Tongue</a>: Amulon, leader of King Noah's corrupt priests. Not only does he make a successful career out of flattering both the king and nation, but when it all goes south, with the king executed and the priests banished, the Lamanites catch them living with a bunch of Lamanite girls they'd abducted and married - and Amulon not only talks his way out of trouble, but impresses the Lamanite king so much that he is appointed a ruler over the captured Nephites. Bear in mind that at this point, the Lamanites had already <em>fought a war with the Nephites</em> over the kidnapping, since they assumed that the Nephites were responsible. And yet, when they find the actual perpetrators, Amulon's skill with words somehow keeps him on top.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledCityOnAHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoiledCityOnAHill">Soiled City on a Hill</a>:<ul><li> The city of Ammonihah, after killing all the members of the church there.</li><li> More broadly, the Jaredite and Nephite nations.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a>: When Nephi prays for understanding of his father's vision, the Spirit of God visits him and shows him the tree that his father saw.

Instead of summing up the results of an investigation, he prophetically tells everyone exactly what they'll find when they investigate. The judges want to charge him as a conspirator, but since the culprit completely admits guilt and absolves Nephi, they can't make it stick, and they walk away confused.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympathyForTheHero">Sympathy for the Hero</a>: When Abinadi first turns up, preaching that the people are wicked and must repent or be punished, no one wants to hear it. But when king Noah burns Abinadi to death, one of the king's priests protests, and goes away to continue teaching Abinadi's words in secret. When the king then finds out, and attempts to massacre hundreds of people who were peacefully following Abinadi's teachings (causing them to flee from the kingdom), that triggers a widespread revolt.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasTheLastEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatWasTheLastEntry">That Was the Last Entry</a>: Moroni, in summarising the book of Ether, reports that the last thing he wrote was that it didn't matter whether he died or was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">translated</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>: The Anti-Nephi-Lehites, repentant Lamanites, take up an oath to never go to war or kill again, burying their weapons in the ground. They hold to this so strongly that when assaulted by other Lamanites they are willingly cut down; that dedication impresses the Lamanite army so much that they stop attacking and many even join with them. Eventually the Lamanites come back for round 2, and it's implied that they went so far as to torture some of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies to death, without being able to provoke them into striking back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnTheOtherCheek">Turn the Other Cheek</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>: The Anti-Nephi-Lehites prefer to be killed rather than defend themselves.

Several prophets, notably Moroni, felt quite confident in their ability to speak well, but then they were given the task of <em>writing</em>, which didn't come to them so easily.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">Understatement</a>: In just a few sentences, Nephi states that his family travelled for eight years and "did wade through much affliction in the wilderness". He's not kidding. Plotting out their course from Jerusalem reveals that they were cutting across Arabia, through one of the worst deserts in the world, the "Empty Quarter". <em>Eight years</em> in that terrain is no joke.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnnamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnnamed">The Unnamed</a>:<ul><li> Mormon states that God told him not to write the names of the Three Nephites. That said, he did record the names of all twelve disciples; he just didn't say which three of them it was.</li><li> Nephi never names his sisters or any of the daughters of Ishmael, including his wife. In fact the only wife of a prophet named in the book is Sarah, the wife of Lehi and mother of Nephi. This despite the fact that most of the prophets have sons.</li><li> The prophet Helaman, while serving as the chief judge, has a servant who goes undercover to infiltrate the first secret society, coming to a head when he foils an assassination attempt by escorting the assassin toward the judgement seat and stabbing him on the way. We never learn the servant's name.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith">Unwanted False Faith</a>: After he kills or maims an entire robber warband singlehandedly to protect a flock of sheep, Ammon has to explain to the Lamanite king that he isn't the "Great Spirit". Since he <em>is</em> a missionary being protected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">Divine Intervention</a>, this may overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopWorshippingMe">Stop Worshipping Me</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>: Amalickiah loses it after his initial attacks against the city of Ammonihah and Noah utterly fail thanks to Moroni's spending the past <em>four years</em> building up the cities' defenses.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">Villainous BSoD</a>: Five men are sent to check whether Nephi's prediction of the chief judge's murder is true, though they don't expect it to be. When they find the judge dead, they are so shocked, and so scared that Nephi's words about the wickedness of the people and coming judgements might also be true, that they all collapse to the ground.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousVow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousVow">Villainous Vow</a>:<ul><li> There are stories of "secret combinations" (ie conspiracies) and the book warns against them. Often overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a>. Cain is said to have started them. It warns that they are found among every civilization, even in the modern era. Probably a reference that includes government and business corruption, and organized crime.</li><li> Also, after an embarrassing defeat, Amalickiah vows to drink Captain Moroni's blood.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption">Violence Is the Only Option</a>: After repeated attempts to obtain the Brass Plates by other means, Nephi kills Laban because he was specifically told by God to do it. As in, God had to go out of His way specifically to persuade Nephi that killing Laban is the only reasonable option left. Made even more notable by the fact that is the one time Nephi flat-out argued with God over a course of action. He REALLY didn't want to kill Laban. May also be a rather sad bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>. Only a few years later, Nephi is leading his people in wars against his brothers. He had to get used to killing people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarForFunAndProfit">War for Fun and Profit</a>:<ul><li> When Zeniff goes back to the land of Nephi, the king of the Lamanites agrees to let his people stay in hopes of exploiting them. When their numbers increase, he starts to become worried and goes out to start conquering and enslaving them.</li><li> Amalickiah tries to become the king of the Nephites, but when that plan is shot down, he goes to plan B: becoming the king of the Lamanites and conquering the Nephites by force.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>: And there's the results of them.<ul><li> After the major battle between the Nephites and Lamanites in the Book of Alma, some men grew bitter due to the result of it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">It gets worse</a> in the final wars of the Nephites and Jaredites. From battlefields full of corpses that no-one takes the time to bury because they're too busy fighting the next one, to the rape, torture, murder and cannibalism of young female captives. Mormon, in lamenting the situation to his son, declares that he can't pray for his own people anymore, and is instead praying for God to wipe them out.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeCanRuleTogether">We Can Rule Together</a>: Giddianhi invites the combined Nephites and Lamanites to join his oath-bound robbers as full partners. It wouldn't have been a good deal, though; there would have been no one left to plunder, and the robbers had already shown a willingness to turn on each other if it seemed profitable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIsYourXNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereIsYourXNow">Where Is Your X Now?</a>: After arranging for all believers in the city to be exiled or burned, the ruler of Ammonihah challenges Alma and Amulek in this fashion, declaring that they didn't have the power to save anyone, and God didn't save them either. After he brings in a bunch of friends and associates to join in the mockery, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">an earthquake brings down the building on their heads, leaving only Alma and Amulek alive</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">Who Wants to Live Forever?</a>: Nine of the twelve Nephite disciples decide their highest wish is to die once their service is over and go to heaven. The remaining three receive the promise that they will live until Christ's second coming, in order for them to be perpetual missionaries. Their story includes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to John the Revelator.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeEpisodeFlashback">Whole Episode Flashback</a>: The book of Ether, occurring thousands of years prior to 'current' events.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkInfoTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkInfoTitle">Work Info Title</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">The World Is Not Ready</a>: The brother of Jared apparently saw the whole history of the world in vision, and left a record of it. However, Moroni later records that God forbade him to write it on the gold plates, because the world wouldn't be ready for the knowledge at first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Several villainous individuals or civilisations qualify. Note that most of them are killed shortly afterward.<ul><li> The people of Ammonihah, after rejecting Alma and Amulek's preaching, burn the families of anyone who believes in God. The whole city is put to the sword by the Lamanites a short time later.</li><li> The Jaredites arm <em>everyone</em>, including women and children, for their final battle. After a few days of fighting, only a few adult men are left, marking the end of their nation even before those few finish killing each other.</li><li> In Mormon's day, the Lamanites feed captured children meat from their own fathers. It's telling that they still won the war; by that point, the Nephites were <em>even worse</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>: Several people attempt to avoid their demise once their death is told to them by a prophet. Of interest is the fact that all those who tried to fight fate were clearly told what to do to avoid their destruction, but were unable to follow those instructions, mostly because of their own pride and desire to live their lives their own way. A few, once they saw the wrongness of their ways, tried to turn back, but by then, it was too late. So, in a real sense, they brought their own destruction upon them. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">lesson</a> here is <em>Listen to God's advice before it's too late</em>.<ul><li> King Noah attempts to escape with his life along with a few other men, and tells them to abandon their families. They become angry and burn him as foretold by Abinadi.</li><li> Coriantumr, last king of the Jaredites, is warned by the prophet to repent or else Coriantumr will be the last survivor of his people, but he initially doesn't listen. Eventually, as the war progresses, he starts to come to his senses and tries to stop the conflict - but his opponent has heard about the prophecy and wants to prove it wrong by killing him, so the fight continues, with Coriantumr's supporters and enemies killing each other until only Coriantumr is left.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">You Can't Go Home Again</a>: Once Lehi's family has spent eight years crossing the Arabian desert, even Laman and Lemuel have stopped asking to go back to Jerusalem. They keep complaining about ever having left, mind you, but there's no suggestion of turning back now. Then they cross the ocean to a new continent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungestChildWins">Youngest Child Wins</a>:<ul><li> Nephi is the youngest of four brothers when Lehi leaves Jerusalem, but is chosen by the Lord to be a ruler and teacher to his rebellious older brothers. Note that the third brother, Sam, listened to Nephi and was righteous, but Nephi was still the star.</li><li> The Jaredites developed an unusual system of passing down the kingdom to the youngest son of the king, after their first attempt to crown a king resulted in all the older brothers refusing it. Unfortunately, this led to many conflicts, when an adult son had a strong interest in preventing his father from having any more children.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
