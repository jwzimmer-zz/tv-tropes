In movie terms it is somewhat closer to Admiral Piett and Captain Needa than Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin. Thrawn himself (the aforementioned alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>) was certainly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> of the highest caliber, one whom the reader did not hesitate in respecting. The trilogy also reflected the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> movement into the Information Age, with Thrawn (and Karrde opposite him) being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperAwareness">connect esoteric and obscure bits of data together into a much larger picture</a>. Thrawn in particular was able to practice an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">almost obscene version of psychoanalysis</a> on people and cultures by studying their artwork, using it to identify weaknesses in their thinking or perception patterns, and then exploiting said weaknesses in devastating ways.

These novels basically <em>invented</em> the New Republic that the Rebellion became. A few years later, Zahn wrote the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Hand of Thrawn</a></em> duology.</p><p>On June 21, 2011, the 20th anniversary edition of <em>Heir to the Empire</em> was released, including a new novella featuring Thrawn, <em><a class="urllink" href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Crisis_of_Faith">Crisis of Faith<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, and some interesting notes by Zahn himself on the process of the writing of the novel.</p><p>On July 16, 2016, it was announced at Celebration Europe that Thrawn (voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsMikkelsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarsMikkelsen">Lars Mikkelsen</a>) would appear in Season Three of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thrawn">a new non-Legends novel</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimothyZahn">Timothy Zahn</a>, making him the first major post-<em>Jedi</em> Legends character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersCanon">to be transitioned back into the new timeline</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>In addition to the character and universe tropes it carries over from the Original Trilogy, this series provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDSpace">2-D Space</a>: Thrawn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> is realizing that an opposing commander is thinking this way, and launching an unstructured three-dimensional attack Elomin are <em>utterly incapable</em> of dealing with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent">Achilles in His Tent</a>: After playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a> at the climax of <em>Dark Force Rising</em>, the genius general Garm Bel Iblis, the only commander the Republic has who can even <em>begin</em> to stand up to Thrawn on the battlefield, is sidelined at the start of <em>The Last Command</em> by Mon Mothma due to long-standing trust issues between them and retires to brood when Thrawn attacks Coruscant. Leia goes to meet him to implore him to take command of the defence (and discovers that Garm's issues aren't rooted in pride, but a refusal to work with Mon Mothma until he knows he has her <em>full</em> trust), but it's only when Mon Mothma makes a personal appeal that he agrees to take command again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Mara Jade flies spaceships, shoots, and even fights with a lightsaber on one occasion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyThatsMyAssistant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyThatsMyAssistant">Actually, That's My Assistant</a>: Leia notes that this used to happen with her and Winter back on Alderaan, as Winter not only looks more like a classical aristocrat than she does but has a certain grace and bearing that just comes naturally; Leia can do the same, but at least from her perspective it's more a mask she puts on rather than part of who she is.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>:<ul><li> You know Zahn cracked a nice little smile when he realized this.

Nobody else has ever acknowledged this as being true or, for that matter, happening. Zahn also has Mara claim that the Death Star I debacle is why Vader lost his right hand: in punishment for his failure.<ul><li> Zahn and a couple others actually did <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> a form of this back into canon. A comic had a battle between Republic forces (including Pellaeon) and besieged Separatist aliens who were quick-growing clones of their warriors in tubes, and as they compressed the growth cycle further and further the clones started getting disjointed. The Empire started moving away from Kamino cloning to experiment with Spaarti cylinders, an entirely different tech, and growing clones too quickly in those tends to make them insane. The Thrawn Trilogy attributes this to interference from too many identical Force presences in the same place (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a problem which Thrawn solves through the use of Force-suppressing ysalamiri</span>). It also helps that he was vague about all of that the first time around. Another short story has Vader lose his (already mechanical) right hand after the Death Star is destroyed, so this could be blamed on Mara assuming that he still had a biological hand at this point.</li><li> Averted in that the "rule of thumb" for safe cloning is a minimum of one year, and ideally three to five years. Fast forward (or rewind) to <em>Attack of the Clones</em>, and the Kaminoan system results in a clone trooper taking about <em>ten</em> years to reach maturity.</li><li> The two systems also produce completely different kinds of clones. Spaarti clones are exact duplicates with memories and skills intact, while Kamino clones are just a bunch of guys with the same DNA (and optionally growth acceleration) who have to be trained from scratch.</li></ul></li><li> The biggest Clone Wars related issue is that Zahn sets them over a decade before the eventual timeline established by the prequels. This was actually Lucas's fault rather than Zahn's&mdash;as Zahn revealed in his annotations in the 20th anniversary edition, Lucas hadn't yet settled on a concrete timeline for the series pre-<em>A New Hope</em> and eventually compressed it from the more expansive one he'd given Zahn at the time.<ul><li> Related, a grievous math error takes place when the Noghri claim in <em>Dark Force Rising</em> that Vader came to them and "helped" them forty-four years ago. At the point in the continuity the books took place, Luke and Leia could be no older than twenty-eight, meaning Vader would have been a fallen Jedi for at least sixteen years <em>before</em> Luke and Leia were even born. It could be put down to miscounting, but they specifically say it's been forty-eight Noghri years, and in the "years of the Emperor", forty-four. <em>The Essential Guide to Alien Species</em> later clarifies that Honoghr has a shorter year, and they were using Honoghr years rather than standard.</li></ul></li><li> Zahn also writes from the not-unreasonable assumption that the Clone Wars involved an evil clone army attacking the galaxy. Everyone automatically assumes Thrawn's use of clones will lead to Clone Wars II even though the origins of the wars wound up being completely different&mdash;the Empire's a hostile enemy state while the original conflict was a civil war. Not to mention that the clones turned out to be the "good" guys in the Clone Wars, so to speak.</li><li> Zahn describes Coruscant as having hills, isolated towers, greenery, and mountain ranges&mdash;later books describe it as a planet-wide city (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowsOfTheEmpire">Shadows of the Empire</a></em> specifically mentions the peak of the tallest mountain on the planet is the centerpiece of an otherwise normal city plaza), and the movies locked that in.</li><li> Jawas are common enough not only on Coruscant, but in the Imperial Palace itself, for their robes and hoods to make viable disguises for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leia's cadre of Noghri bodyguards</span>.

For instance, the idea that Jabba the Hutt was the galaxy's biggest crime lord&mdash;later works present him as the most powerful of the Hutts, but that the Hutts were able to be pushed around by more powerful organizations such as Black Sun. (But then most of the bigger fish died <em>before</em> Jabba did, so it's possible that by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em> he really <em>was</em> the top crime lord in the galaxy.)</li><li> Rogue Squadron is treated as just another fighter squadron and Wedge Antilles is specifically called out as a 'lowly starfighter wing commander' and Luke has to remind the Council who he is. When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> drastically increased the importance and recognition of Wedge and the Rogues (for example, in later stories that take place chronologically earlier, Wedge is nearly Admiral Ackbar's right hand, with the latter having expressed a desire to make that status official and promote Wedge to general<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2oafg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2oafg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2oafg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Something that chronologically would happen just days after Thrawn's defeat, in the eighth book of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing Series</a>.</span>, and instrumental to liberating Coruscant), Zahn was careful to include this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Hand of Thrawn</a></em>, where Rogue Squadron is composed of the best pilots in the galaxy, are never depicted losing one of their number, and are attached to the task force under the command of the Republic's most respected active field commander. In a society more like modern Earth's, a "lowly starfighter wing commander" would be about right, but given Wedge's own record and that <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Zahn himself noted in Heir to the Empire that the Republic tends to rely too much on symbols</a>, it would make a lot of sense for the Rogues to have no small amount of fame.</li><li> Hyperdrive speeds are quoted as "Point Three, Point Four, Point Four Five, Point Five" in increasing order of speed&mdash;this being based on the line in the first Star Wars film that "The Falcon can push point five past lightspeed". This was based on a logarithmic scale Zahn devised where 0 was a dead stop and 1 was infinite speed. Later Star Wars material changed this to the (arguably less logical) setup that the LOWER the number is, the faster it is&mdash;specifically, it's all based on the idea of 1 as the "baseline" hyperdrive speed, so the "number" of a hyperdrive became the modifier to travel time. i.e., The <em>Falcon</em> is about twice as fast in hyperspace as most ships.</li><li> A plot-significant one is that it is not widely known to the galaxy's people that Darth Vader was Luke's father, and it's even not certain to most people that he's dead. Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Legends</a></em> writers basically assumed that "everyone in the galaxy had seen the films" as far as information about the main characters were concerned; if this was true the Mara-Luke plot arc and the Noghri kidnapping arc couldn't exist.</li><li> Thrawn is mentioned as being part human to explain his being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a> other than skin color and glowing eyes. However, this was presently speculation by Han &mdash; that he was "at least, not entirely" human &mdash; not necessarily as the definitive truth. It would still be used later on, with the Emperor falsifying his records to say he was of mixed blood to try and explain why he made an apparent nonhuman a Grand Admiral, despite his xenophobic policies. (Thrawn was just too good <em>not</em> to use in that position, and being part human would mitigate some of the disagreement of the other Grand Admirals). It also helps that Thrawn was one of the earliest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a> characters in the series; when the book first came out the setting was notable for avoiding it, with even the most humanoid species having at least one really weird feature (such as the head-tails of Twi'leks).</li><li> Zahn based his description of Talon Karrde on the character of Avon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlakesSeven">Blake's 7</a></em>, who was clean-shaven. Thus, there was no mention of Karrde having facial hair. However over time the depictions of Karrde have given him beards and/or mustaches (possibly because, rightly or wrongly, artists suspected that Karrde was something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a>).</li><li> Zahn's view of stormtroopers comes from the original meaning of the word, referring to elite soldiers. The deployment of stormtrooper squads is treated like a significant display of force and the potential squandering of a precious resource, a sharp contrast to how they are treated as generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a> in pretty much all other <em>Star Wars</em> media. The term seemed to be come into use originally because of its link to the Nazis. (Since the later Lucasfilm era and the Great Mouse Adjustment, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Solo">Solo</a></em> film have somewhat vindicated this portrayal. In <em>Clone Wars</em>, the troopers, obvious forerunners of the stormtroopers, really are elite soldiers; and in <em>Solo</em> the "mudtroopers" on Mimban are not actual stormtroopers but part of the Imperial Army. Default stormtroopers, however, are little more effective than they ever were, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">at least against heroes</a>.) Later entries by Zahn would relegate most of that reputation to elites like the Royal Guard, but he still portrays the <em>image</em> of stormtroopers in their armor as still distinctly unsettling as reminder of the Empire's tyranny to people in the Republic even after the war ends.</li><li> With the limited number of Jedi and other Force users in the movies at that point, a lot of C'baoth's portrayal as a Jedi had to be created from whole cloth. Some discrepancies, like his use of Force Lightning, can be excused by Luke not knowing enough about being a Jedi to see the problem. Others, like the fact that the records claimed C'baoth started his Jedi training when he was in his twenties, are more difficult to handwave.</li><li> The very concept of "Dark Jedi," as the Sith did not exist yet. There's a throwaway line about how Vader and his Dark Jedi hunted down the remaining Jedi, when the prequels and the Disney cannon would establish that Vader was a <em>Sith</em>, who was aided by Inquisitors.</li><li> Zahn's implication that Jedi Masters like C'baoth and Yoda did not employ lightsabers (Yoda's battle with a Dark Jedi on Dagobah is described as "a full-scale Force war"), as the only two Jedi Masters featured in the movies, Yoda and the Emperor, didn't use the iconic weapon (Old Ben was not, at the time, identified as a Master) and instead relied entirely upon the Force.</li><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> C'baoth dies, his body explodes in an energy of blue fire just like Palpatine&#146;s body did. The implication of C'baoth&#146;s death is that all dark side masters explode</span> when they die. This never happens again.</li><li> For that matter, there's Luke's status as a Jedi. By the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>, there's pretty much no doubt that Luke is a full-fledged Jedi Knight, and even more so five years later when this trilogy takes place; yet he is still plagued by doubts and insecurities, particularly over his ability to train new Jedi, and he himself is still learning. Come the next major <em>Star Wars</em> story, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkEmpire">Dark Empire</a></em>, Luke has eliminated all his doubts and promoted himself to Jedi Master &mdash; even though, in <em>Dark Force Rising</em>, he actually scoffs at the notion that C'baoth had done essentially the same thing. (Later, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Hand of Thrawn</a></em>, Mara Jade actually rips Luke a new one for presuming to declare himself "a Jedi Master with less than ten years on the job.")</li><li> Winter states that "Targeter" was only one of her many Rebellion-era codenames, and she used it for only a few weeks, on one planet, before abandoning it when that particular Rebel cell was attacked and dissolved. But since she never specifies what any of the other codenames were, she's referred to as Targeter in many stories that take place during the war, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XWingRogueSquadron">X-Wing Rogue Squadron</a></em> and Zahn's own <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarWarsAllegiance">Allegiance</a></em>.</li><li> Cloaking shields in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> were generally unknown save that small ships were believed to be unable to use them. Zahn described them as being impractical for another reason: they created a double-blind effect. You couldn't see or detect a cloaked ship, but they couldn't see or detect anything beyond the cloaking effect, either. Then the prequels and <em>Clone Wars</em> came along and some ships were described as having cloaking shields that didn't have this effect. The Legends continuity would explain that these were two different kinds of cloaking tech, with the one that wasn't double-blind being much more expensive and relying on very rare and delicate materials. With the Legends continuity now non-canon, there is no discrepancy.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a>:<ul><li> Winter.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Mara</a> goes back and forth between this and <em>very</em> emotional, depending on the topic at hand.

Most of what goes wrong for Thrawn later on is a result of this error snowballing into disaster. The most plausible explanation for this error was that Thrawn didn't know that Leia and Luke were in fact Vader's children (see above). Without that key piece of information, drawing the proper conclusion would've been all but <em>impossible</em>. However, later EU authors have had trouble deciding whether that fact was common knowledge or not.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a>:<ul><li> Thrawn gets one in the opening pages of <em>Heir to the Empire</em> when the <em>Chimaera</em> is attacked by four Rebel assault frigates and three squadrons of X-wings. Pellaeon thinks those odds are badly in the Republic's favor and prepares to retreat, but Thrawn displays his art-derived tactical genius and defeats them (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoABarrelRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoABarrelRoll">Do a Barrel Roll</a> above). Besides this, it also establishes that Thrawn represents the turn of the tide for the Empire and they are no longer in decline and running from fights.<ul><li> Thrawn gets one in-universe when he arrives at Karrde's base in a trio of shuttles. Karrde automatically assumes Thrawn to be in the center shuttle, only for the Grand Admiral to emerge from the one on the right. Karrde takes it as a sign that Thrawn is not a predictable man.</li><li> He gets still another one when Luke escapes from his Star Destroyer in an X-Wing and Thrawn goes to confront the Imperial officer whose job it was to catch him. Previously in the trilogy, Thrawn had had another officer killed in a very similar instance, and so every assumption is that Thrawn will again pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">Vader Special</a> and the hapless officer will be punished severely or worse. Instead, there follows a question and answer session where the officer demonstrates that he did everything he could to catch the X-Wing and even had some outside-the-box thinking in trying to overcome Luke's countermeasures against the tractor beam the Star Destroyer had been using. Convinced that the officer did everything that could be expected of him, Thrawn tells him to carry on. The difference is that in the first instance, the officer tries to throw his superior under the bus by claiming he didn't give him proper training, while in this case the officer fesses up to everything he did and took responsibility, establishing that Thrawn's action come from a harsh but fair discipline and not a capricious temper.</li></ul></li><li> Mara gets one when Karrde invites her to an opulent business dinner, without telling her anything about it in advance. She adapts to the unusual situation instantly, and Karrde reflects that he should have known the unusual setting wouldn't throw her off-balance. When he discusses making her his second in command, he can see she's immediately suspicious that the offer is a smoke screen for some "more personal request or demand." Once she's assured the offer is legitimate, she warns Karrde that if he gives her that kind of power, she <em>will</em> use it, and launches into a thorough discussion of the organization's shortcomings and plans to rectify them.<ul><li> Karrde gets his first one in that same scene. Not only carefully gauging Mara's ability to take the role he's offering, but him noting the handful of topics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">guaranteed to get an emotional reaction from her.</a> He also offers to assist Pellaeon in obtaining ysalamiri, free of charge... when Mara asks what Karrde and organization get out of it, Karrde states that he gets to have his people watching the Imperials from the moment they land to the moment they take off, and to have another trusted associate, Aves, around who knows how to ask the right questions, and possibly figure out why the Empire wants them (since harvesting a mass of ysalamiri is rather overkill just to deal with Luke Skywalker). This shows that Karrde is savvy, intelligent, and values information and intelligence above everything else.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>:<ul><li> Leia has three over the course of the books&mdash;figuring out the secret of Delta Source based on watching a cleaning droid, working out how Thrawn's impossibly rapid cloning works from a chance remark by Mara and realizing just how badly (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or, more precisely, for how long</span>) the Empire has been exploiting the Noghri and how she can prove it. The first two are in <em>The Last Command</em>; the third is in <em>Dark Force Rising</em>.</li><li> Han gets two in the Battle of Sluis Van, realizing what the Empire is doing with mole miners (and sharing the second with Lando in realizing how they can stop them).</li><li> Zahn seems to love this trope.

Unusually for this trope Thrawn is very much aware of the dangers of using the insane Dark Jedi and takes precautions, as well as long-term plans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">dispose of and replace C'baoth</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They nearly work, too.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>:<ul><li> While Joruus is otherwise a dead-on example, he sees no appeal to the idea of ruling over millions of people he'll never even meet, considering total control over people he personally interacts with on a daily basis to be the true meaning of power.

The meditating Force-user's allies are filled with confidence, clarity, and coordination. Especially powerful Force-users can also sow fear and confusion among their foes. Grand Admiral Thrawn notes the effects, and Pellaeon later compares stats after battles with and without, and measures the effect of battle meditation as giving nearly a 40% buff to every measurable category of crew performance. However, only a few Force-users are capable of effective battle meditation, and even among them most can't use it without occupying their full attention. Further, it can result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy">Decapitated Army</a> (it's speculated by Thrawn that the reason the Battle of Endor was lost so decisively after the Emperor's death is that he had been overusing it during his reign, and the loss of his presence threw the Imperial Fleet at Endor into confusion when it was removed). Thrawn comes up with a few new uses for it; among them, by stationing a cloaked ship on the inside of a planetary shield and having Joruus C'baoth use battle meditation to coordinate its fire with that of an uncloaked ship on the outside of the shield, he creates the illusion that turbolaser fire is passing right through the shield as though it weren't there.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a>: Thrawn's tactics tend to be somewhat inventive.<ul><li> An example: traditional thought declared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInSpace">cloaking fields</a> to be militarily useless as they interfere with the cloaked ships sensors as well as any others', preventing them from accomplishing much in battle. Thrawn comes up with no less than three methods of using them to practical effect.</li><li> First, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he uses it to hide a bunch of TIE fighters <em>inside</em> a freighter, causing the ship's hold to register as empty, then have the freighter show up at a Republic shipyard, making a neat Trojan Horse</span>. Second, he uses C'baoth's Force skills to coordinate cloaked ships that have gotten through planetary shields by flying in well in advance of an attack, in order to make it look like his lasers can pierce said shields. The third, perhaps the most practical of his cloaking tricks, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thrawn got the idea to cloak a couple dozen asteroids and tractor them into orbit around Coruscant, essentially cutting the New Republic capital off from the rest of the war by forcing them to hide behind their planetary shield until the asteroids could be found and destroyed.</span></li><li> Then there's the "Thrawn Pincer". Interdictors are supposed to create inverted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedAmbush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedAmbush">Hyperspeed Ambushes</a>&mdash;instead of jumping in on the enemy, Interdictors use huge gravity projectors to <em>un</em>-jump the enemy onto <em>you</em>. Thrawn uses this to his advantage by re-inverting the trope: by having his backup wait just outside the battle zone and having his Interdictors aim their gravity wells in certain directions, Thrawn can order the ships in on a heading that directly intercepts said gravity wells and essentially <em>spawn reinforcements exactly where he wants them</em> (usually right on top of unprepared enemy ships), with far more precision than even the most skilled pilots and navigators could manage, and with a much greater safety margin as well. (Hyperspace microjumps, especially in the vicinity of planets (where most battles take place), are very dangerous maneuvers.) Other characters would borrow the tactic; Admiral Ackbar perhaps puts it to most effective use it in the chronologically next book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">X-Wing: Isard's Revenge</a></em>.</li><li> Thrawn not only uses Star Destroyers for hit-and-run attacks (when conventional military doctrine says they should basically be mobile siege platforms), but he gathers them mere fractions of a light-year outside the target system, making a very precise hyperspace jump to their target. Pellaeon notes in his internal monologue that he and Thrawn had "a long and barely-civilized argument" over it when Thrawn first started adding it to their list of standard tactics, but after long practice the crew are actually very good at it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>:<ul><li> C'baoth is a <em>very bad man</em>.

Later sources clarify that at this point, the Republic and the Empire are almost perfectly matched in terms of materiel.

A gestating clone of Jorus C'Baoth (why was he being grown?) broke free from his restraints, fought and killed the Dark Side user that the Emperor left to guard the facility and took it over. Zahn's notes in the annotated 20th Anniversary Edition dispel the fan-theory that Joruus actually was the guardian of the mountain, and forgot it (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OutboundFlight">Outbound Flight</a> makes it very likely that Joruus didn't even have much "clone madness", since his behavior was very similar to that of the real Jorus C'Baoth, if more erratic and unpredictable).

Several of his mistakes actually come from assuming his enemies are smarter than they are, and that they are making moves against him that in reality they didn't even think of. Possibly the best example is when he concludes that Leia took the <em>Millenium Falcon</em> to Endor in search of something from the wreckage of the second Death Star for information that she believes the Emperor may have had with him when he died, like the location of the Mount Tantiss cloning facility. Leia and the New Republic had no idea Mount Tantiss even existed, let alone how critical it was to Thrawn's plans and thus that they really should be looking for it.

The 20th Anniversary annotations note that he made the conscious decision to only use humans as viewpoint characters, because he felt that lending the necessary "alienness" to alien or droid characters would hurt the narrative. Thus, we only see Thrawn through Pellaeon's eyes, and are left to marvel at his intellect and reasoning skills just as Pellaeon does. And, of course, there are subtle hints (paid off in <em>Hand of Thrawn</em>) that Thrawn was grooming Pellaeon to succeed him, by constantly giving him chances to puzzle out what Thrawn is doing and why, as well as wanting someone with a different frame of reference as his right hand to challenge Thrawn's ideas to make sure they held up.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>: Averted in that Thrawn values his men's lives and does not waste them.

This consideration, however, does not extend to the Noghri, who he'll sacrifice blithely... though even then, he only sacrifices them when he's certain they have a legitimate chance of success.<ul><li> This is actually played with when Thrawn gets his cloning cylinders up and running, as he can use this trope to soften the blow for conquered worlds and, consequently, decrease the chance and severity of future resistance by stating that he will not need to institute a draft for the newly conquered world (thanks to the fact that, because he has clones, he has all the soldiers he'll ever need).</li><li> A major plot point, especially in the first book, is that both sides are actually suffering a critical manpower shortage.

Oddly enough, even though it is in the later two books where the majority of his arc takes place, he gets much less cover space on the final book and isn't even on the cover of the second.

It's described as roughly 200 fairly small spaceships, which even together are unlikely to be a match for even one of the big Imperial battleships from the movies (such as Vader's flagship).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>:<ul><li> Thrawn successfully runs so many of these that he gets the protagonists chasing their own tails trying to avoid stepping into the next one. He pretty much defines the trope in an aside to Pellaeon, patiently explaining why they're considering attacking a world which the New Republic prizes greatly&mdash;but not yet.<div class="indent"> "When we're finally ready to draw the Coruscant sector fleet into ambush, Mrisst will be the perfect lure to use. If they come out to meet us, we'll defeat them then and there. And if they somehow sense the trap and refuse to engage, we'll have our forward base. Either way, the Empire will triumph."</div></li><li> A despairing Lando, trying to get something out of a paranoid Admiral Drayson, tells him:<div class="indent"> "We all agree Thrawn's a brilliant tactician. But we can't assume that everything that happens in the galaxy is part of some grand, all-encompassing scheme that he's dreamed up."</div><ul><li> Played with right back, as the retort is that even if this isn't part of Thrawn's plans, he'll certainly work it in if learns of it (through his information tap in the New Republic government center.)</li></ul></li><li> A particularly apt example of the trope is when Thrawn sends commandoes to capture Leia's children, but briefs them that if they fail, they should falsely implicate Mara Jade as an Imperial spy in order to prevent her giving her knowledge to the Republic. Pellaeon considers this order defeatist and admits he wouldn't have come up with it himself, but it turns out to serve Thrawn's purposes well.</li><li> Thrawn does much the same in the first book when he plans to capture Luke while he's en route to see C'baoth, but realises that if the capture fails, Luke might be suspicious that the Empire knew he was coming. So Thrawn sets up a fake ambush of a freighter so it looks as though Luke was just unlucky enough to hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWarpingZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWarpingZone">No Warping Zone</a> intended for that. And it works: Luke does manage to escape, but doesn't realise C'baoth is working with the Empire.<ul><li> It does fail in one respect: <em>C'baoth</em> figures that Thrawn was trying to alter their deal. This is a major factor in splintering their alliance.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">Xanatos Speed Chess</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a>:<ul><li> Karrde desperately trying to keep Han and Lando from finding Luke and vice versa, and then trying to keep all three hidden from Thrawn while still not letting them become aware of each other.</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">raid for the CGT</span> at the end of the trilogy had the Empire, Republic, and the fringe trying to outwit each other. Then it all came down to the main characters' battle with C'baoth on the other side of the galaxy triggering a completely unrelated Noghri plot.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreTooLate">You Are Too Late</a>: Not quite as dramatic a reveal as usual for this trope, with no ticking clock or imminent explosion, but the Republic scrambles against time to find the <em>Katana</em> fleet before Thrawn, and engages in a vicious battle when a Star Destroyer arrives to stop them, but once it is over they discover that Thrawn had already discovered the fleet hours, if not days ago, and has already claimed more than three-quarters of the fleet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>: Done straight in the first book, then subverted in the third.<ul><li> The first was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlofeldPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlofeldPloy">Blofeld Ploy</a>, but it's not capricious - the situation is ambiguous, and Thrawn explains why he considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> to be the one at fault. He was checking if the Mook was badly trained, or just an idiot who can't take blame. When he confirmed it was the latter, he had the mook killed, and had the trainer prepare a replacement. Efficiency went up afterward.</li><li> The second time, the situation was similar, but the mook had shown quick thinking and inventiveness, even if he'd failed. Instead of killing him, Thrawn promoted him and told him to work on solving the problem that had beaten them. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">He did.</a>)</li><li> Further, the first was a situation whose solution was known, while the second hadn't been solved by anyone yet. The second officer also took responsibility for their failure. The first (a conscript, who might have been resentful of having to serve) <em>tried to pin the blame on the superior officer who trained him.</em> (The officer, for his part, claims he tries to treat conscripts and volunteers equally, and admitted he couldn't remember specifically putting the crewman through that training situation, though it was definitely part of standard training packages.) One speculates whether he would have kept his head, if not his post, if he'd just admitted his mistake; Thrawn doesn't punish failure with summary execution. To Thrawn, doing this the way Vader and Palpatine did is stupid because killing failures leads to less innovation, and people fight more effectively when their leader inspires them.<ul><li> To be more clear, he doesn't punish failure, he punishes <em>fault</em>. And trying to make your superior officer look bad in front of <em>his</em> superior to deflect blame from your own laxness in failing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadTheFreakingManual">Read the Freaking Manual</a> is a capital fault. As he eloquently explains:<div class="indent"><strong>Thrawn:</strong> Do you know the difference between an error and a mistake, ensign? [...] Anyone can make an error. It only becomes a mistake when you refuse to correct it.</div></li></ul></li><li> His reactions based on hypothetical scenarios so as to flesh out what Thrawn is actually punishing - failure to act in the best interests of duty and position (so, incompetence):<div class="indent"> - First Book: Fails to follow proper procedure, tries to blame superior officer - death</div><div class="indent"> - Third Book: Follows proper procedure, notices it doesn't work (or else there <em>is</em> no proper procedure to follow), tries something different - promotion for obeying the spirit of the order as well as the letter and showing initiative</div><div class="indent"> - First hypothetical: Fails to follow proper procedure, accepts responsibility - demotion or re-training</div><div class="indent"> - Second hypothetical: Follows proper procedure - nothing (he did everything required)</div><div class="indent"> - Third hypothetical: No proper procedure to follow, hesitates to act as a result, accepts responsibility - admonishment but no further disciplinary measures</div><div class="indent"> - Fourth hypothetical: Fails to follow proper procedure, tries something different because he knows proper procedure wouldn't work - public dressing down for not following orders; but no other effect (perhaps he might be taken aside to develop the new system "on the sly")</div><ul><li> It's likely to note that Vader would likely have killed all of them for failing (at least, if they'd failed to capture Luke).</li></ul></li><li> There's also the commander of the Bilbringi shipyards, who clearly expects to be on the receiving end of this trope after some smugglers blow up a nearly-completed Star Destroyer. Instead, Thrawn gives him until the <em>Chimaera</em> leaves the system to design and implement a new security system to prevent such a thing from happening again, at which point he'll make his decision. Thrawn notes that this particular officer is quite competent, but simply has a tendency to get complacent... a tendency which, for the moment at least, he should be cured of. (This one actually doesn't pan out too well for him. In the finale, Bilbringi is infiltrated by the nascent Smugglers' Alliance, though it's not known if they would have been so successful without a full-scale Republic assault happening.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourApprovalFillsMeWithShame">Your Approval Fills Me with Shame</a>: Well, not shame <em>per se</em>, but Leia is initially thrown for a loop when she finds out that the Noghri revere her as the daughter of Darth Vader. Of course, it lasts about half a second before she starts furiously strategizing how to work this to her advantage because, well, it's Leia.<div class="indent"> The whole thing was rapidly becoming unreal... but one fact already stood out. The alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoseofSupplication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoseofSupplication">prostrating himself</a> before her was prepared to treat her as royalty. <br><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">And she knew how to behave like royalty.</a></div></li></ul><hr><em>But it was so artistically done.</em>
