The first book in the series, <em>Franklin in the Dark</em>, was released in 1986 by Kids Can Press and its popularity led to over twenty books in the original series.</p><p>In 1997, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a> adapted the characters for an animated children's series with the same name that appeared on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NickJr">Nick Jr.</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> in the United States, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamilyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FamilyChannel">Family Channel</a> in Canada, and has since been seen around the world. In each story, Franklin explores themes and values of importance to kids, including the first day of school, a first sleepover and the importance of perseverance and being true to one's friends.</p><p>In 2010, Nelvana <a class="urllink" href="http://www.awn.com/news/television/nelvana-s-mipcom-slate-features-new-cg-franklin-and-more">announced<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> the production of a new CGI series, <em>Franklin and Friends</em>, ordered for 26 episodes, featuring familiar favorites and a new character, Aunt T. The series was previewed on Treehouse TV on February 14, 2011 and began regular broadcasts in March. In the United States, it began airing in Nickelodeon's morning block on February 13, 2012, nearly a year after it was first seen in Canada. In September 2013 it also premiered in the UK.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Franklin</em> celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2011. There were a total of four films released for the original <em>Franklin</em> series: <em>Franklin and the Green Knight: The Movie</em>, <em>Franklin's Magic Christmas</em>, <em>Back to School with Franklin</em> and <em>Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure</em>. <em>Franklin and Friends</em> has two to date: <em>Polar Explorer</em> and <em>Deep Sea Voyage</em>. Both were made with the participation of the theme park SeaWorld, which also hosts a Franklin attraction at its park in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>Two <em>Franklin</em> CD releases are known to be available. The first, <em>Hey, It's Franklin!</em>, was released in 2000 and includes music from the film <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em>, as well as two different stage shows.

For example, the turtle talisman in <em>Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure</em> was pretty obviously CGed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcrophobicBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcrophobicBird">Acrophobic Bird</a>: Mr. Sparrow in "Franklin in the Dark" is afraid of heights, so sometimes, when nobody is looking, he puts on his parachute.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>: In "Franklin and the Mooseratops," Mr. Fox can't help but chuckle at one point at Franklin and Bear's antics as mooseratops (wearing branches on their heads as antlers), even though everyone's getting a bit annoyed with him and neither he nor Mr. Owl really want to encourage them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The stage show adaptation of <em>Franklin's Class Trip</em>, "Franklin's Big Adventure," adds the character of Miss Carbunkel the museum guide and a dinosaur that Franklin and Snail sing a song with. (When asked if he eats trees, he replies "Just the leaves&mdash; I'm a ve-ge-tar-i-an!") In the book, Franklin and Snail are worried about the possibility of meeting real, scary dinosaurs at the museum, only to learn that dinosaurs are extinct and the museum only has fossils/skeletons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: Franklin&#146;s friends Hawk and Duck from the earlier books are absent from the cartoon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a><ul><li> In <em>Franklin's Magic Christmas</em>, both Franklin and Harriet try to venture on their own to Woodland from Faraway Farm in order to get Dr. Bear to help their grandpa. True, things work out, but both of their grandparents, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Turtle, are left to worry over what might happen to them in a wooded area on a very cold night following an ice/snowstorm.</li><li> In <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em>, Franklin and Snail travel through and over woods, cliffs, and mountains, Snail is rescued from <em>drowning</em> and they face off against serious dangers both real and imagined, then make it almost all the way back home before anyone even realizes they're missing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: Most of the stories are based on teaching one of some sort.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a>: In <em>Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure</em>, Aunt Lucy mentions a "mystic" who lives at Turtle Lake and Mr. Turtle comments "Can't say I believe in hocus pocus myself." Apparently he has forgotten witnessing his son and daughter traveling on the back of a flying reindeer in <em>Franklin's Magic Christmas</em>. Could also be considered a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarySkepticism">Arbitrary Skepticism</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCGICartoon">All-CGI Cartoon</a>: <em>Franklin and Friends</em></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative Name</a>: Beatrice "Bea" Bear.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysKnowAPilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysKnowAPilot">Always Know a Pilot</a>: "Franklin and Snail's Dream". Snail's dream is to fly, but many different attempts by Franklin prove futile, that is until Mr. Turtle calls on a pilot friend of his, who just happens to also be a snail, and flies around in her own snail-sized plane, to make Snail's dream come true.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a>: This is evident in <em>both</em> <em>Franklin</em> and <em>Franklin and Friends</em>. The former did not follow the order of the book series before it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvertookTheSeries">overtook it</a>, while the latter shows the origin of the Bumpy Buggy several episodes in.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnatomyAnomaly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnatomyAnomaly">Anatomy Anomaly</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Averted</a> in the original <em>Franklin</em> books and TV show when Franklin can't get a visit from the tooth fairy because turtles don't have teeth. Yet oddly, in "Franklin and the Super Sleepover" in <em>Franklin and Friends</em>, Franklin complains about the Beavers taking much longer to brush their teeth than turtles and the Turtle family is clearly indicated to be waiting to use the bathroom to brush their teeth. Furthermore, in "Franklin's Campout," Mr. Turtle tells Franklin that he'll have to brush his teeth after eating a marshmallow snack, so apparently turtles have teeth on <em>Franklin and Friends</em>. And yet, in the third season story "Franklin and the Lost Lost Tooth," Franklin says quite clearly that "Turtles don't have teeth." (Somebody make up their mind!)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsNotToScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalsNotToScale">Animals Not to Scale</a>: The woodland animals are more or less their respective sizes and we have the accurately tiny Snail, but then comes Franklin, a turtle, who is as tall as a beaver and more than half the size of a bear. Moose is another one that is a bit more accurate, and his family is even bigger, though he's only seen in one installment of the television series and a smattering of the books. Then there's Eagle from the <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em> film, who is massive and able to carry Franklin and Snail for a ride on her back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a>: Like most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a>'s shows. Many of the first season stories are based directly on the original books. This was dropped after the first season, though some stories still occasionally incorporated story elements that first appeared in the books. In particular, <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em> adapted some material from <em>Franklin's Baby Sister</em>, while <em>Franklin's Magic Christmas</em> gives Franklin a line that was used as the ending of the narration of <em>Franklin and Harriet</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimationBump">Animation Bump</a>: There were four movies and each have their own distinctive visual style. Fans vary on which was their favorite. In pure technical terms, however, the final film <em>Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure</em> had the best animation, thanks to a number of former Disney animators being hired on to work on the film. This film also contains a fair amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicShift">Anthropomorphic Shift</a>:<ul><li> From the earlier books to the television series. In the earlier books, the animals looked more realistic, right down to their sizes - Bear, Fox, and Otter were much bigger than Franklin. Also, many of the characters (including Franklin's parents) walked on all fours. Starting in <em>Franklin Plays the Game</em>, the seventh book in the series, all of the characters are the same size and the designs are more cartoony.</li><li> Rabbit and Fox frequently walked on all fours in the first season of the television series, but in later seasons they always walked on their hind legs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreWeThereYet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreWeThereYet">Are We There Yet?</a>:<ul><li> Harriet gives an exasperated one in the <em>Franklin's Magic Christmas</em> special when she gets bored of the especially long car-ride to her and Franklin's grandparents on Faraway Farm. Later, a "We there yet?" is her way of revealing that she sneaked along on Franklin's secret attempt to ride a horse to Woodland.</li><li> In <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em>, Snail sighs and asks this after he and Franklin go on a long journey to find a magic cherry tree supposedly contains blossoms that can bring spring. Fortunately, the answer is yes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgumentOfContradictions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArgumentOfContradictions">Argument of Contradictions</a>:<ul><li> Beaver and Fox have one throughout "Franklin's Halloween" over whether or not there are real ghosts. Later, they get into one about whether or not Mr. Owl's ghost disguise trick (he fooled them because they originally thought he was Bear, only to later to discover that Bear wasn't at the Halloween party) scared her, which is ended when Goose admits that it <em>did</em> scare her and Franklin says that it scared them all, but it was fun.</li><li> In "Franklin and the Adventure on the Planet Zorb" from <em>Franklin and Friends</em>, Franklin, Bear, Fox and Rabbit have one with Beaver and Goose over whether they should all play astronauts (the boys' chosen game) or pixies (the girls' chosen game.) They go back and forth several times until Snail declares a "red alert," saying that they're making his ears hurt. Franklin agrees that yelling at each other won't solve everything and they're forced to actually come up with a constructive solution to their problem.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">Art Evolution</a>: Thumb through the first Franklin book, then go through each season of the TV series, then the movies, and finally the CGI television series.

The return trip is depicted as a cheery canoe ride and a brief walk that is presented in about one minute of screentime, just long enough to play a triumphant instrumental version of one of the film's songs, "Getting There is Half the Fun."

They are able to simply piece the large broken chunks of the globe back together again, but recess ends before they can use tape to bond the pieces together. At first nobody notices the visible cracks on the globe, but just as Franklin and Bear prepare to tell the truth, Goose accidentally bumps into the damaged globe when going to sharpen her pencil, revealing to Mr. Owl and the others that it's broken, leading Goose to think <em>she</em> broke it and start thinking she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz">The Klutz</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat">much to Franklin and Bear's relief</a>... for a while.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>: The subject of "Franklin's Homemade Cookies" - Franklin is unflinchingly critically honest of Bear's craft project that he gives to him and then has to deal with the same thing when it turns out his cookies have way too much ginger in them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">Buffy Speak</a>:<ul><li> In both the book and television versions of <em>Franklin's Bad Day</em>, Franklin declares it to be the "worstest day ever."

Unless, of course, "doesn't have any pets" is just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">code</a> for Henry having died and the characters not wanting to talk about it directly, but <em>Franklin</em> has never been afraid to tackle to tough issues before.</li><li> In "Who's Who in Woodland, Franklin?", Franklin and Bear are entirely unaware that Mr. Groundhog is the town weather forecaster and has many interesting weather gadgets. But Franklin learned all about the weather from Mr. Groundhog, as well as his gadgets, in the original show.</li><li> In <em>Back to School with Franklin</em>, Harriet was upset that she was losing her daily playmate because Beatrice was a year older than her and was starting preschool. In "Franklin's School" on <em>Franklin and Friends</em>, however, it's indicated that both are the same age and neither has ever been to school before, but both will soon be starting school with Mr. Owl.</li><li> Despite Skunk not being a regular character in <em>Franklin and Friends</em>, a skunk character was a seen a few times in earlier episodes. Then, the 2014 book <em>Franklin and the Case of the New Friend</em>, revealed that the kids were under the impression that there were no skunk families in Woodland and surprised when they found a photo of a skunk family.

In the story told in the film, the Green Knight finds a magic cherry tree, whose blossoms he uses to bring spring to a village that has been blanketed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringIsLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringIsLate">far loo long</a> under a deep winter snow.

He showed up in some future books, but not so for the TV series. Instead, they did an entire story in the first season about how Moose moved to town, joined Franklin's class and the two became friends. He was then never seen again, the most likely explanation being that he was just too awkward to draw, given his large size and antlers. There are any of a number of other characters that have simply come and gone with no explanation. <em>Franklin and Friends</em> has been better about this, at least so far, anyway.

It's a cute picture, but of the four <em>Franklin</em> stories featured on the release, only one of them is post <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em>, "Franklin's First Star." It's a story focused on Franklin and his friends and Harriet barely appears in it, if at all.</li><li> The cover artwork of the <em>Franklin and Friends</em> release "Sharing is Caring" shows Franklin presenting a drawing of a heart to Harriet. Again, it's a deliberately cute picture, but there's no scene like this in any of the stories on the DVD and Harriet only appears in one of them. Seems whoever's doing the DVD covers for Kaboom likes the little tike or at least thinks she's quite marketable.</li><li> "Family Day," another of the compilation releases, is even worse by having Harriet prominently on both the front and the back, despite all of the <em>Franklin</em> stories on the DVD being from before the fifth season.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrashIntoHello">Crash-Into Hello</a>: In <em>Polar Explorer</em>, Franklin meets the penguin Pip after Pip crashes into him while sledding.

There's no story about someone getting in trouble because they don't think helmets are cool. There is, however, one entirely focused around Franklin getting a fancy new helmet with a flashing light on top because he's outgrown his old one and some of the other kids find the new helmet goofy. When he hears the kids making fun of that type of helmet, he hides it and tries to borrow his friend Bear's to use for a bike safety rally, only to be told that you should never wear a helmet that hasn't been specifically fitted for you. In the end, another friend helps him to see that it doesn't matter if the other kids think the helmet is dorky and the bike safety officer suggests that the flashing light could be a useful safety feature. He is seen wearing this helmet throughout the rest of the series. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

She tries various ways to make it up to him, but he eventually realizes how he would feel if he lost her when she tries to go search for the fish on her own.</li><li> The episode "Franklin Says Sorry" also deals with this (but more directly, the importance of apologizing for something.) Bear makes a flag for the group's make believe ship, and reluctantly shows Franklin when he notices him sneaking it there. Bear entrusts Franklin with keeping it a secret. Fox bugs Franklin to tell him the secret, promising not to tell, and Franklin does so. But when he and Bear return, we find Fox <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">showing the flag to the others</a>.

On the other hand, we have the Henry (a hamster - <em>two</em> hamsters actually, both named Henry), Goldie (Franklin's pet goldfish) and a baby duckling, and many other birds who are purely zoomorphic.</li><li> In "Franklin Migrates" (also available in book form as "Franklin Celebrates"), Franklin meets Goose's extended family, who all behave much more like regular geese by migrating to the south in the winter. The book version even goes so far as to suggest that Goose doesn't agree with her parents' practice of staying put. As the other geese fly away, Goose whispers "One day I will be with them, Franklin."</li><li> Then there was the story of Franklin wanting a pet dog. (His realization that a pet dog didn't suit him was how he ended up getting Goldie instead.)</li><li> The "Wake Up, Spring" song in <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em> has Rabbit getting pelted by nuts after pestering a squirrel resting a tree while searching for signs of spring. Which is odd, because this series does have fully anthropomorphic squirrels. Non-anthro squirrels were also seen in some installments of the original television show. <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em> also has what appear to be non-anthro deer, seen in the reprise of that song, performed by the characters.</li><li> In <em>Franklin's Magic Christmas</em>, Franklin's grandparents own a non-anthro cat named Whsikers, but also receive a visit from their anthro-doggy neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Collie.

After they all make &#147;friendship bracelets&#148;, Franklin sees the two exchange bracelets and that was the end of his relationship, until Bear appears and says that his bracelet was actually for Franklin. Then, Bear tackles Franklin and begins to tickle him for Franklin's bracelet.

Franklin fears and laments that Bear has left him for a a new "best friend". The show likes to have close pairs like Franklin/Bear, Beaver/Goose, Fox/Rabbit, and then Franklin tells Fox his predicament. Fox thinks it's silly because even though Rabbit is playing with Bear, they are still best friends with Fox and Franklin, respectively.

During a soccer match, Franklin accidentally gets his shell turned around backwards and unable to see properly, ends up scoring on his own goal. Everyone laughs about it, but he personally doesn't find it funny. What really gets his goat, though, is that throughout the day his best friend Bear continues to make light of the incident. He eventually snaps at him in a way that shocks him and all of his friends. When he gets home, he explains what happened to his parents. Mr. Turtle then shares a story of a time when he belched in the middle of a recital of "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" at school. After a brief moment of shocked embarrassment, there was nothing else for it but for him to laugh it off himself. Mrs. Turtle then shares her own story of being out shopping with Harriet that morning. She grabbed an orange from a precariously placed stack and the entire pile toppled onto the floor. Harriet got a good laugh out of it and Mrs. Muskrat, who happened to be there shopping also, quipped that the forgot to put oranges on her shopping list and stopped to help pick them up. Hearing these stories helps Franklin to see that he was too hard on Bear and he ends up inviting him to dinner to apologize. During the dinner, Bear has trouble squirting the mustard for his hot dog and ends up getting it all over his shirt.

It turns out that she's just protecting her eggs, though once Franklin and Snail state that they don't want her eggs, she becomes positively pleasant. The same is also true of Eagle beforehand, which Franklin equates with the monster from the Green Knight story and draws his paper sword as if to fight her. She tells him that she has no interest in fighting him, gives both him and Snail a ride, and later says she has to go because she needs to take care of her eaglets. This also happens with a bird dubbed the Wily Winged Beast in the stage show <em>Franklin and the Adventures of the Noble Knights</em>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvilJustMisunderstood">Not Evil, Just Misunderstood</a> and gets her own song about it titled "Misunderstood."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>:<ul><li> Even popular series of this sort are usually lucky to get even one movie. <em>Franklin</em> got four of them&mdash; <em>Franklin and the Green Knight: The Movie</em> (the only one to include the phrase "The Movie" in the title), <em>Franklin's Magic Christmas</em>, <em>Back to School With Franklin</em> and <em>Franklin in the Turtle Lake Treasure</em>.

Mr. Goose was seen before in the original television program (he's Woodland's pharmacist) and Franklin once visited Gooses's house for a party, but this never came up. It's as good an explanation as any though for why Mr. Goose is so rarely seen.</li><li> Alternatively, this can be seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revision">revision</a> of sorts, as it is heavily implied that the <em>Franklin and Friends</em> series takes place a while after the original <em>Franklin</em> show; with the fact that Goose's parents filed for divorce in between this time frame.</li><li> Season 3's "Franklin and the Copycat" has Mr. Mole teaching Mr. Turtle to play golf for the first time, while Season 5's "Franklin Plays Golf" at the very least heavily implies that Mr. Turtle is an accomplished golfer with his own set of clubs who eagerly anticipates each new golf season. No matter how you slice the timeline, or lack of one, on this series, something about that just doesn't quite tally.</li><li> In one of the stories from <em>Franklin and Friends</em>, Franklin tries to teach Goose to fly, with it eventually being decided that it's okay for her to wait until she's a bit older.

Their refuge is the treefort, but it doesn't last very long at all, as Snail quickly points out the flaws in the idea. Then, when they go back to Franklin's' place to get some supplies, they get found hiding in the closet after hiding there because Bear knocked on the door.

Though their fears are dismissed as silly, they turn out to be justified. When the other kids get tired of being told what to do, they decide to go play in the treehouse, but right before they enter, it gets blown down by a stiff wind. Everyone is immediately repentant to Bear &amp; Franklin and everyone pitches in (with adult help) to build a new treehouse.</li><li> Played a bit more straight in the fire-safety story "Franklin and the Fire," in which Franklin tries to remove anything from the Turtle family household that he thinks could be a potential fire hazard, including candles and a toaster.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat">The Scapegoat</a>: Goose becomes this in "Franklin and the Broken Globe."

But Goose thinks <em>she</em> broke it and accepts the blame, and at first Bear and Franklin are relieved, but Goose goes onto think she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlutz">The Klutz</a> and not want to do anything with her friends anymore, and Bear and Franklin soon start to feel guilty and eventually confess to Mr. Owl that they were the ones that broke the glove in the first place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchmuckBait">Schmuck Bait</a>: Franklin and Rabbit fall for an obvious prank involving chocolate tied to a rope in "Franklin's Funny Business."

In the story, Franklin was the Nutcracker Prince, but had to overcome stage fright to perform the role. The second play was in the third season story "Franklin's Starring Role," a performance of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a></em>. In this story, Franklin doesn't have stage fright anymore, and is upset when he is assigned the role of stage manager, thinking his teacher Mr. Owl doesn't think he's good enough to have a part. In the end, he learns that Mr. Owl gave him the role of stage manager because he felt he was responsible and he wanted to give others a chance to play roles after Franklin had the lead in the last play. The third play was in the film <em>Franklin and the Green Knight</em>, a performance of a fairy tale picture book popular in Woodland: <em>The Quest of the Green Knight</em>. Franklin again takes the lead role this time, as the Green Knight, though the film is also about him thinking that he could truly become the Green Knight and bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringIsLate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringIsLate">Spring</a>, as the Green Knight in the story does.

He's already scared because of an incorrect belief that they're going to see a real live dinosaur there and Miss Carbunkel's oddness doesn't do anything to help. He tries to rope Snail into his plan to leave as well, but Snail is actually the voice of reason who puts the kibosh on the plan, noting that the bus back doesn't come until well after lunchtime and they need to just have courage and "do this."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket">Security Blanket</a>: Franklin has a favorite blanket that he can't sleep without, though by the third film, he decides his sister's need is greater than his own and gives it to her to comfort her when she's upset.

Miss Koala, calling roll, gets through several of the character names and then refers to Franklin as "Turtle" and Beaver laughs. He tells her that she's Franklin, not "Turtle." She apologizes and asks if there are any other surprises. Everyone just sort of shakes their heads. Once the kids started getting siblings, though, they had to start coming up with other names. Franklin's sister was Harriet, but the other character's siblings still fit the theme, such as Beatrice (Bear's sister) and Kit (Beaver's brother.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellingBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellingBee">Spelling Bee</a>: Miss Koala, the replacement teacher in <em>Back to School with Franklin</em>, decides to hold one on the first day.

The problem, of course, being that only <em>one</em> treefort can be built and they need something that satisfies everyone. It's Franklin who comes up with the idea for compromise, they can't all have <em>everything</em> they want in the treefort, but each of them can use their best idea and they'll put it all together.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>: Two gargoyles named "Gar" and "Goyle" respectively in the <em>Franklin and the Adventures of the Noble Knights</em> stage show.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAnimalName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockAnimalName">Stock Animal Name</a>: Franklin's pet goldfish is, unsurprisingly, called Goldie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockNessMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockNessMonster">Stock Ness Monster</a>: Michiochi in <em>Franklin's Pond Phantom</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SureLetsGoWithThat">Sure, Let's Go with That</a>: In "Franklin and the Thunderstorm," Franklin is nervously staring out the window of the library, which he and his friends have taken refuge in, worried that there's going to be a thunderstorm.
