The fire dragon is also subjected to this. Some of the animated crowds are done via CGI too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AboveGoodAndEvil">Above Good and Evil</a>: Upon Rory's introduction, the light novel highlights that Emroy does not care about good or evil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">at least not by any human standards</a>. Despite being the god of <strong>judgement</strong>, Emroy decides your fate based upon only one standard. "Are you willing to live, or more importantly, die by your own core principles?" Consistently, Itami has shown that he will, and as such he, and the JSDF under him, can count on Rory's support. People who have not, like the bandit recruit who pleaded for mercy "because his hands were still clean" and the leftist politician who tried to exploit Rory and the Coda village situation to discredit the JSDF for her own political ambitions were met with Rory's disgust and rage respectively.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">Accidental Marriage</a>: In episode nineteen, Lelei announces that she's married to Youji. She then explains that if they spend three nights together in the same room, it's considered a marriage. Tuka, Arpeggio, and especially Rory don't take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyJealousGirl">this announcement</a> very well, with the latter reaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere-like</a> levels when questioning Youji on why he "married" Lelei and even slept with Tuka (when she thought he was her father briefly), but has yet to do anything naughty with her. Arpeggio meanwhile suffers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>, and slams a bowl of soup down on her sister's head in jealousy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: The female members of Youji's squad, of course. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">Especially Shino</a>.

Some examples, as seen from the character sheet, are Grey, Risa, Senator Kouhara, and Advisor Shirayuri.</li><li> Some characters who look good already in the manga receive a further attractiveness boost. Compare Shino and Hamilton between the manga and anime.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalModesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalModesty">Adaptational Modesty</a>: As the animators had to fit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">TV rating requirements</a>, they understandably toned down the (quite significant) amount of skin seen in the manga and light novels.<ul><li> The citizens of the Empire generally wear Medieval style clothing instead of togas in the anime. Togas do make appearances in the court scenes, such as the Senate discussion in Episode 2, Sugawara's visit to the court in Episode 11, and the garden banquet in Episode 13, so they appear to be more of the formal court dress rather than casual clothing &mdash; exactly like they actually were in Rome itself, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">to think of</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08m0s');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note08m0s" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08m0s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In fact, despite its enormous prestige, on a practical level the Romans <em>hated</em> toga: it was expensive, cumbersome, hot, heavy, prickly, a chore to wear and an even greater chore to maintain, especially the gleaming white <em>"toga candida"</em> and purple-striped <em>"toga praetexta"</em>. Both the Republic and the Empire had to maintain a legislation that <em>required</em> wearing the toga to the Forum and other official functions under the pain of a stiff fine, otherwise the people preferred to wear much lighter and more comfortable tunic+cloak combo, making impossible to distinguish the slaves and the foreigners from the <em>quirites</em>.</span></li><li> Bozes' nightgown is not see-through in the anime.</li><li> During the bathhouse shootout, many of the girls' robes were open exposing their underwear. Their robes were closed in the anime.</li><li> After Rory massacres the men who tried to kidnap the Special Region guests and is covered with blood, Itami makes her strip out of her kimono and then hoses her down to get rid of the blood. In the anime, it cuts directly to Rory back in her street clothes and clean.</li><li> Princess Pi&ntilde;a's formal dress is not as revealing and Delilah's waitress uniform does not expose her cleavage as much in the anime. In one scene where Delilah took a nap naked, she just took her shoes off in the anime.</li><li> Tyuule's rape scene is shown only in silhouette through the gauze of Zorzal's bed canopy, and the camera in general avoids showing her body.</li><li> The prostitutes in Akusho are more covered up in the anime, and their clothes again aren't see-through like in the manga.</li><li> Noriko is not nude in the negotiation scene in the anime adaptation, instead given a still-revealing simple rag.</li><li> In the manga, during the earthquake, several of Zorzal's men were in states of undress, presumably because they just woke up. In the anime, they were in full armor.</li><li> The dark elves' outfit in the anime are less...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperific">Stripperific</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: Despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>, the anime did take out some scenes, like the part where the girls are drinking at the hot springs inn - In the anime only the drunken faces of Shino and Rory are seen. Also, Risa fails to make any mention of Itami's mother during his Japan trip in the anime.<ul><li> In the Anime, the Ginza Incident seemed to last little more than an afternoon before the Tokyo police and the JSDF stopped the rampaging Imperials. However in the Light Novels and manga, it took almost a week for the last remnants of the invasion force to be captured or killed.</li><li> The anime removed some scenes with the Akusho district, such as how the JSDF manage to infiltrate the capital, the big four criminal bosses meeting about the JSDF before Bessara attacks the JSDF base at Akusho, then also the aftermath. Misery simply wraps the whole thing with her meeting with Kurokawa.</li><li> The distillation is most evident with Episode 14, which is the entirety of Volume 5 from the manga compressed into a 20 minute episode.</li><li> Gets worse in episode 18, wherein the anime skips the entire "plague zombie" saga and Itami's reunion with his mother, as well as Risa's introduction to Yao. With the anime ending with Pi&amp;ntildea's coronation as Crown Princess, those parts won't be seen.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: The anime fills in extra scenes between events in the manga.<ul><li> The time after the Ginza Incident is more fleshed out with Itami, including the introduction of Kurata.</li><li> The Battle of Alnus Hill is shown with all three charges done by the Imperial army rather than just the last night battle.</li><li> The anime expands on precisely why Zorzal, the second prince, is actually the crown prince as opposed to the first prince. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In a rare moment of humility, Zorzal admits that Diabo is actually smarter than himself, and mentions that Molto beat and tortured their older brother to death because he was "too smart" and wasn't suave enough to hide it. Oh, and that Zorzal was forced to see it.</span></li><li> A literal example of this trope is the Gate itself. In the novels, the Gate is large enough for one tank to get through.

The novels note that the battle in Ginza took a week to conclude, more than enough time for the US to send troops trained to help clear buildings in the nightmare of urban combat. Even the most conservative Japanese politician would invoke the treaty in order to eliminate invaders and rescue trapped civilians, then send in a joint task force that could make use of the far superior logistical support and surveillance of the US armed forces (in order to maintain their status as a defensive force, the JSDF does not maintain the resources necessary for operating away from the home islands). However, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Since it's "part of Japan", the invading army and its leaders are legally "terrorists" and can be dealt with using domestic forces only, without violating Article Nine of the Japanese Constitution which prohibits offensive military action. This leads to the odd situation where the occupying forces are sent in with obsolete Cold War equipment in case the expedition goes wrong, and keep their inferior firearms and such even after it becomes clear that there is no military match on the other side of the Gate.</li><li> Later volumes reveal that even if the Prime Minister had not used the legal fiction of the land across the Gate being Japanese territory, the US Military was getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">held up in Iraq</a> to the point that they were in no position to help as they simply can't spare enough troops for a joint Japan-US military force to travel through the gate.<ul><li> While several tens of thousands of American military personnel (plus American equipment) are available in bases on Japanese and South Korean soil, one must remember that America's primary local military priorities do not include crossing a magical gate into a fantasy realm. Even if the gate were two battle tanks wide, having the Americans go through alongside the Japanese would create a logistical nightmare because of non-interchangeable equipment (the two forces generally do not have anything in common except small arms ammunition and vehicle fuel). Note that American military advantages would be severely reduced once across the gate (American strategic advantages such as satellites, cruise missiles, and heavy bombers would not be able to pass through the gate).</li><li> This is subverted in a later chapter when it is explained that the JDSF brought giant cargo planes through the Gate by disassembling and re-assembling them at Alnus Base.</li></ul></li><li> Another example, this time caused not by the author politics, but rather by the questionable translation choice, is in Episode 4. In the English translation, Kurokawa and Kuribayashi tries to get Itami's attention by calling "Captain!" However, Itami is a lieutenant so he pays no attention. So after they screamed their lungs out for his attention, Itami simply calls for the unit's actual Captain that the two were seeking him. In Japanese, however, both shouted "Taicho!", which doesn't denote rank and can refer to <em>any</em> unit leader &mdash; meaning that Itami was simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">so absorbed in his web novel</a>, that he didn't get that they were calling specifically <em>him</em>, as a yet another illustration to his dorky nature.</li><li> Even worse, in the same scene Kuribayashi ends up kicking Itami (her CO and a decorated, commissioned officer) in the butt to get his attention, in front of other officers no less. Striking a superior officer is a severe breach of discipline and is grounds for a court martial in almost every modern military in the world<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note37cns');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note37cns" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note37cns');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The other officers don't like Itami very much and probably feel that he deserved to get kicked for ignoring proper protocol, which can be deadly if the base were suddenly attacked</span>.</li><li> During the fight at Hakone Mountain, the Japanese SFG identity one of the three Black Ops Team sneaking into the mountain as Americans when they find a dead black operative. Comments, varying with the source material, are made to the effect that only the US has black soldiers. While considering the circumstances this is a reasonable assumption, other nations with overseas Black Ops capability also have black soldiers &mdash; some are US allies, like the UK and Canada, but even Russia has some blacks in its armed forces.</li><li> It is prominently and explicitly shown that the Japanese have set up their beachhead on Alnus hill as a star fort. While an effective fortification in its heyday of the 1400s-1600s (the design blunted the impact of cannon and the points allowed defenders to hit any attackers in their flanks) and impressive looking, today it is simultaneously obsolete, pointlessly over complicated overkill considering the demonstrated capabilities and technologies beyond the Gate, and inherently prohibits any expansion of the base. There's a reason why modern military bases, even in hostile territory, boil down to layered squares; modern military capabilities can prevent small covert attacks with trenches, fencing, surveillance, and internal security, while large attacks can be detected and interdicted before they get within 100 kilometers of a base (especially in the grassland and rolling hills with scattered forests shown to surround Alnus). The expedition already demonstrated that when they annihilated a force several times larger without ever coming under direct attack when they first came through the Gate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>: The eventual fate of every Apostle. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is hinted that Rory is trying to delay her ascension for as long as possible, since when she does she loses any vestige of human emotion she has left.

In the meantime, they provide supplies and benefit from being Japan's ally. Later, when Princess Pina and several others come back through the Gate, this seems to be forgotten and the US attempts the same covert grab tactic that China and Russia employ in order to get the visitors from the Special Area into US custody, with blackmail used when the Japanese defense is unexpectedly deadly. The two other black ops teams Rory puts a bloody stop to that effort, though the US still maintains covert watch at the Gate in another attempt to grab them. The president throws a fit when that fails too and Shino blabs about the covert attacks on live TV, but considering the team lost, the valuable blackmail lost and how close they came to succeeding compare to China and Russia's efforts it's perhaps understandable that he's less sanguine than they are.

This reminds Pi&ntilde;a that just because you can conquer someone, doesn't necessarily mean that they want to follow you afterwards.</li><li> Earth is this as well- aside from other nations wanting to get into the action of the Special Region and all its resources, the Japan arc shows that not all Japanese are in agreement over the handling of the Region, as shown when they try to rake Itami over the coals for the losses sustained in actions against the Empire and the Flame Dragon.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu">Humans Are Cthulhu</a>:<ul><li> A pre-gunpowder society encounters a 21st Century military.

The Emperor however, sent none of their troops into battle; instead they had tributary nations send their troops to their deaths.

Pina is disgusted by this approach, but Zorzal gives them immediate approval to do whatever they want.

For the most part his leadership overlooks these infractions, or don't heavily punish him for it, such as restricting him to the base for a few weeks.</li><li> Zorzal tries to make use of this in order to quell any sentiments of a peaceful resolution with the Japanese.

Both of these are cut from the anime, making Zorzal wonder why Pi&ntilde;a is so "friendly" with Japan as a result. In exchange, we get to see a bit more into the conversation between Zorzal and Diabo, and we learn that Zorzal has absolutely no compunction against "playing with his toys" in public, as he proceeds to sexually assault Tyuule, despite his injuries, right in front of Diabo.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Precision F-Strike</a>: Lelei, the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">Emotionless Girl</a>, shouts "Die, you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reptilian</span> piece of shit!" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">at the Fire Dragon.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProductPlacement">Product Placement</a>: In episode 9, a bookstore is shown selling light novels and manga by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Alphapolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Alphapolis">Alphapolis</a>, Gate's publisher, which includes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReMonster">Re:Monster</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalSlacker">Professional Slacker</a>: Itami, and even admits as much when questioned by a PSIA agent.

She uses her giant halberd to smack the flail-wielding bandit really far away. Later, Delilah smacks away a bar patron who tried to grope her.

This meant absolutely nothing to the JSDF who had the advantage of superior modern warfare to the Empire's medieval gear, proving hot weapons are superior to cold weapons. Notable examples:<ul><li> The first battles at Alnus Hill between the JSDF and the Unified Kingdoms Army. Though the Unified Kingdom was 100,000 strong, they lost badly to the JSDF's 10,000 due to heavy artillery rounds, stopping them from even getting halfway up the hill.</li><li> In the Italica battle, Itami, Rory, Kuribayashi, and Tomita were able to beat back a large group of marauders flooding the east gate before one of their copters wipe out the rest.</li><li> Zorzal orders his large group of soldiers to kill Itami's small party.

Fortunately for her, the JSDF immediately withdraws its forces with no intention of occupying the city, and gives them rather generous demands, such as cost of living reimbursement for anyone they send to the city, tax exemption on sales and trade for Lelei, and to treat the prisoners humanely.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath">Rasputinian Death</a>:<ul><li> It takes a lot of effort to bring down the Fire Dragon.

See Curb-Stomp Battle above.</li><li> When Japan sends their army to another world, they equip their troops mostly with Cold War-era stockpiles and US Army surplus. This is explained and justified by Itami; the JSDF is the victim of budget cutbacks, and had to assemble their task force very quickly using whatever materiel they had available. Since they were fighting an enemy of unknown strength, they considered the possibility that they might have to retreat back through the Gate, and brought gear they could leave behind with minimal economic impact. Additionally, the lack of GPS and telecommunication satellites in the Special Region makes the older weapons more useful than the newer digital-based systems.</li><li> Pi&ntilde;a is a trained warrior, but had not been in a real battle before. She freezes up when her plan at Italica goes wrong and everybody starts getting slaughtered.</li><li> The JSDF makes a peace treaty with the city of Italica, but since the Special Region doesn't have anything like phones or radios, nobody else knew about it, and they get attacked by the Rose-Order of Knights.</li><li> When visitors from another world (cute, female ones at that) appear on television, they quickly get their own hashtag on Twitter. Doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a> in the anime.</li><li> During the Hakone shootout, Pi&ntilde;a and Bozes manage to pick up a couple of the guns that are dropped in the ensuing chaos as they escaped, and the story seems to be set up for a technological breakthrough for the empire with reverse engineering. Then they pass the obligatory security checkpoint at the Japanese side of the gate, and their weapons are promptly found and confiscated. In a bit of a subversion, Itami and third recon claim that the guns were given to the guests for self-defense, but are still confiscated so the Empire doesn't get their hands on them.</li><li> As mentioned below, Sugawara discovered that if all that amount of gold suddenly entered Earth, it would wreak havoc on their world's economy.

Not helped is the <em>other</em> dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>, which is that Dark Elves trained their whole lives to use medieval weapons, and only learned of the <em>existence</em> of modern weapons that same day. Them not remembering how a weapon they didn't know existed works in the heat of battle is another sad bit of reality.</li><li> A fetish-looking winged girl in expensive, revealing garments walks into the hospital without an entourage. Is she a sorceress? A high-elf descended from the mountains? Does she want to pit her magical abilities against the JSDF's best? No. This is the middle ages, education isn't easy to come by, gender oppression is still widespread, and she has bills to pay. She's a prostitute seeking OBGYN services. Even from the conversation, she doesn't sound to pleased with her circumstances either.</li><li> Because all the most experienced troops in the Empire were killed at the beginning of the conflict, the replacements are nowhere near as good. This is further compounded with the fact that their morale is practically nonexistent due to being forced to fight their own countrymen or else they or their families will be killed. They are unable to defeat a force they outnumber over 3 to 1 that is mostly well trained rookies and their past their prime veteran instructors.</li><li> During the battle against the Empire at the Jade Palace to rescue the Rose Order and diplomatic delegation, we see our first Japanese casualties being taken. In essence, even with all the technology and advancements they've made? The JSDF are still as human as the Empire's soldiers.

Due to the Empire having lost thousands of soldiers fighting against the Japanese, Princess Pi&ntilde;a is trying to convince most of the Senate to seek peace with Japan by giving them goods from Earth or returning relatives captured by JSDF. Since the Dark Elves home is located in another nation outside the Empire's borders, the JSDF cannot cross into Empire's territory as doing some would give the Hawk faction in the Senate an excuse to reignite conflict with the Japanese, leading to more deaths, not to mention entering a yet <em>another</em> nation, if a vassal to the Empire, as Elbe kingdom actually is, would complicate the Government task even further. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, when king Duran, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingIncognito">who happens to stay in the Alnus hospital incognito</a>, as much as <em>requests</em> the JSDF help, explicitly allying Elbe with Japan, they were only happy to oblige.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>:<ul><li> Komakado delivers one to Itami about how he had been expected to end his career as a 2nd Lt. in the JSDF until the attack on Ginza made him a national hero, and that he was viewed by his peers as an "Otaku", "A true salary thief", and "at least he understands the JSDF's anti-war values", and that he was an overall slacker who somehow made it good.

Itami coldly tells Zorzal that he's way in over his head and delusional to think he has any hope of winning despite all the setbacks dealt to him. Frankly, it's getting tiresome and annoying, so Itami warns Zorzal if he ever entertains any thought of trying something against them again, they WILL kill him where he stands.

When the JSDF and the locals converse, Japanese becomes the main language, the JSDF speak in broken Japanese trying to speak the local language.

Pina immediately regrets her role in negotiating their release from Japan, while one of them "thanks" her for it.</li><li> The reason for their hostility also shows their ungratefulness to the mercy shown to them.

The chapter ends before we get a look of her and the next chapter skips to two weeks later.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a>:<ul><li> The Imperial Emperor does this, ordering his allies to round up an army to attack the JSDF with in episode 2. Said allies are very suspicious when no Imperial troops are sent in any of the engagements as they're brutally slaughtered by their much better equipped foes. He then does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetNoCrisisGoToWaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetNoCrisisGoToWaste">Let No Crisis Go to Waste</a> to further quell any more uppity peasants who might try to overthrow him.</li><li> Apparently, it runs in the blood. Princess Pi&ntilde;a attempts to do this with Third Recon Team by stationing them alone on the south gate of Italica to take the brunt of the bandit's attacks. It doesn't work since they attack the east gate. Itami, for his part, believes this is due to a lack of options on Pi&ntilde;a's part as opposed to actual malice.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainForgotToLevelGrind">Villain Forgot to Level Grind</a>: Averted, and subverted. Prince Zorzal realizes on seizing the throne that he needs to use new means to strike back at the JSDF, even using means like dressing his troops as the enemy and utilizing subdued armored ogres. Both look like dangerous threats until the obvious holes in such plans (The Empire's troops lacking firearms; the ogres still being vulnerable to anti-tank weapons) are pointed out in the most humiliating ways possible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousRescue">Villainous Rescue</a>: A minor example when Yao goes to notify her people that she brought help, unbeknownst to her, some of the other people held up Itami and the others. However, both groups quickly turn their attention to the Fire Dragon which shows up again.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness">Virtue Is Weakness</a>: The Empire believes that Japan valuing all of its citizens, even the "peasants", and refusing to sacrifice or abandon any of them is a sentimental weakness they can exploit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They don't expect Japan to call in an airstrike as warning though.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>: The Fire Dragon. In his first encounter with it, Itami and his troops are mostly powerless against it, until Tuka tells them to go for its eyes, which also gave them time to launch a rocket at it. However, it only runs away due to losing an arm in said explosion. And in his second encounter, he has even less firepower initially, though fortunately Lelei and Rory manage to hold its attention for a while.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>: Soldiers from a society that hasn't even discovered gunpowder yet end up fighting a 21st Century army with heavy machine guns and artillery. They're completely wiped out before they even get close enough to see their enemy. The JSDF exploits this onto the Empire to convince them to seek a peace treaty rather than keep fighting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHardlyKnewYe">We Hardly Knew Ye</a>: In the anime, Heidegger, Roger and Chuck, the American CIA agents sent to Hakone, are introduced with name tags in their appearances. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They are killed off the next episode by Rory.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>: A few notable instances:<ul><li> In episode five, Itami and the others arrive at Italica expecting a mundane negotiation process, only to find out it's under attack by the remnants of the Allied nations who survived the slaughter at Alnus Hill.</li><li> In episode seven, Itami is captured by Pi&ntilde;a's soldiers who were coming to Italica as reinforcements, unaware that the JSDF had already finished off the enemy forces and a treaty had been concluded between Italica and JSDF. Pina feared her troops brutal treatment of Itami would give the JSDF a handy excuse to attack the Empire again, something they would not survive if the JSDF was allowed to go all out.</li><li> When Tuka, Lelei, and Rory visit Japan, several other nations send their special operations soldiers in an attempt to kidnap the special area locals for their countries. They all seem surprised to see each other at the hot springs inn, prompting a firefight to break out between all of them. Unfortunately Rory ends up killing them all, partly because she knew their intentions weren't exactly noble, and perhaps partly because they interrupted her attempts to seduce Itami. Pi&ntilde;a and Bozes also secretly discuss talks with the Japanese government in an attempt to negotiate a peace deal between the Empire and Japan.</li><li> In episode fourteen, an earthquake hits the lands of the Empire, something that the capitol is completely unprepared for and inexperienced with. Itami also finds out that Zorzal, the crown prince and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a>, kidnapped some Japanese citizens prior to their first attack. One of the captives, a woman named Noriko, had been used as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> the entire time. Itami and his soldiers kill several of Zorzal's men, and then allows Kuribayashi to deliver a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> on Zorzal in retaliation for said kidnappings and treatment of the captives.</li><li> In episode sixteen, a hit is ordered on Noriko in an attempt at at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a>. Fortunately, it's thwarted, and the JSDF starts attempting to find out who was really behind it. Itami and his group also runs into the Fire Dragon again, and attempts to help Tuka overcome the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveStagesOfGrief">Five Stages of Grief</a> she was suffering from when she refused to believe her father was killed by said dragon.</li><li> During episode eighteen, Emperor Molto seems to be slowly and reluctantly warming up to the idea of seeking a peace treaty with the JSDF. He also proposes a toast to Lelei, who he gives almost all of the credit to for slaying the fire dragon since she was technically an Imperial citizen. As everyone takes a drink, Molto then suddenly collapses, while the camera pans to various characters and their reaction to someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamperingWithFoodAndDrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TamperingWithFoodAndDrink">poisoning the emperor's drink</a>. Zorzal, at first, has a shocked look on his face, but it quickly turns into a smirk when he realizes that he won't have to deal with his father anymore once he takes over.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Why did Hardy open that hole in Alnus?"</span><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Explanation: She opened it to let interesting elements from the other side come in long enough to change up the world. It's implied that she opens gates at a regular basis, each time choosing a different world that catches her fancy. After enough time has passed, she'll shut the gate. Of course this means the JSDF must retreat before "enough time" comes, otherwise they'll never return to Earth.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatADrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatADrag">What a Drag</a>: After Itami was captured by Bozes and her knights, they tied his neck to a horse and forced him to run after it.

Itami usually overrides him, but when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pi&ntilde;a gets arrested, and enslaved</span> and Grey suggests <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StormingTheCastle">Storming the Castle</a> as the only viable way of rescue, he wholeheartedly agrees.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>: Every other-worlder is freaked out when they have to take the underground subway. Most of them think it will take them to Hell. Rory has a slightly more justified reason to be afraid; for the past few hundred years, the God of the underworld <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">has been trying to get her to marry her</a>, and she still thinks she'll show up even though they're on another planet. Given that later on, said stalker shows up <em>the instant</em> she sets foot inside a cave, she had reason to be paranoid.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">With This Herring</a>: Played with a bit. JSDF troops (JSDF itself is a defensive-only organization, what with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Japan renouncing war</a> and all) stationed beyond the Gate use relatively outdated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> equipment, but the distinct advantage of modern warfare and weaponry over the highly fantastic enemy troops is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">clear as water</a>. The second episode of the anime explains that the Defense Ministry is having budget cuts, and is planning to decommission the obsolete weapons, to save costs. And in some <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>, in the event the enemy captured them, or the soldiers had to quickly dump their gear to escape, the loss wouldn't be as bad as if they captured more expensive state-of-the-art equipment and weaponry.<ul><li> The manga throws this right out the window, as it shows modern Type 10 tanks leading the charge through the gate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardDuel">Wizard Duel</a>: Lelei has a formal one with her sister Arpeggio in episode 19. Rory serves as referee, and both combatants are surrounded by a protective force field. The object is to destroy your opponent's force field.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a>: The Lindon Academy in the city of Rondel.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">Worthless Yellow Rocks</a>:<ul><li> Inverted. Dragon scales are extremely valuable to the other-worlders, to the point that one good scale is worth enough to keep a man fed for almost a month. The JSDF, with the corpses of several dragons lying around their base from the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">three times the Empire tried to re-take the Gate</a>, is happy to let the refugees harvest as many as they want, since the soldiers have no use for them. The refugees end up with <em>sacks</em> full.<div class="indent"><strong>Rory:</strong> So I guess...we're filthy rich?</div></li><li> Also averted when Sugawara gives one of the terms for the peace talks, namely, an absurdly huge amount of money more or less equivalent to Japan's annual GDP. He later backs down from the figure he gives, realizing that if that much gold was suddenly dumped into the Earth economy, it would potentially destabilize the market. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseEconomics">Or not</a>, as the amount, while large, isn't <em>really</em> large enough to cause the ill effects, but it's certainly large enough to be worth more consideration.</li><li> Yanagida also put terms in Japan-Elbe Peace Treaty that gives Japan rights to any mining resources besides gold, silver, and gems... giving Japan over any oil, rare earths or other minerals invaluable to modern technology.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: The Oprichnina have no problem arresting a 12 year old girl with the intent to execute her for 'treason'.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>:<ul><li> After the Empire conquered the Warrior Bunnies, they claimed that Queen Tyuule cowardly sold out her people and offered herself to Prince Zorzal as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> just to save her own life. In reality, Tyuule offered herself in exchange for her people being spared, but Zorzal ordered her kingdom razed anyway.</li><li> Molto describes the death of the Flame Dragon as if Leilei was the one who did all the work, as the primary combatants were the JSDF (who they're at war with), Rory the Reaper (a Demigoddess, and thus not good for morale), Tuka (an elf, and not an Imperial Citizen), and Yao (a Dark Elf, again, not an Imperial Citizen). Since Leilei is human (even if she doesn't like the Empire much), she's the one he chooses to honor.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>:<ul><li> When the Allied Kingdoms try and retake the portal, they expect their immense numerical superiority to carry the day, given they're 10-1. After their second attempt, they've lost more than half their men without even seeing the Self-Defense Force.<ul><li> After realizing what they're dealing with, Lord Duran decides for a night raid, expecting the new moon to hide them. JSDF scouts with night equipment spot them with ease, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">he realizes they've been spotted when the flares start raining</a>. He is shot several times and barely escapes with his life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughingMad">Laughing Mad</a> at the horror of war.</li><li> During the night raid Duran and some of his soldiers <em>do</em> manage to get on the other side of the hill, and the soldiers put their shields in front for defense in a tactic similar to the Roman <em>testudo</em>. While such a formation would have been extremely effective against arrows, it's quickly wiped out by <em>light</em> machine guns and what appears to be mortar fire.</li></ul></li><li> When the Emperor starts taking the JSDF seriously, he orders his army to use Scorched Earth tactics to deny the enemy supplies to make their journey harder. However, that old kind of tactic won't work with a modern force that uses helicopters, tanks, Humvees, jets and a well established supply line... or rather, it won't work because of the speed and range that the JSDF forces can bring to the table. Without matching abilities, the JSDF can leapfrog over those positions rather quickly. He also has no real concept of the kind of demented warfare Japan can unleash upon his country, and still thinks war with them is winnable.</li><li> The Emperor, again, seriously misjudges Japan's mindset after seeing Zorzal's entourage get butchered and Zorzal himself get brutalized over Noriko and some other Ginza captives being sold into slavery. He figures that threatening Japan's citizens directly, as opposed to fighting the JSDF, and informing Japan's government, will cause Japan to knuckle under, just like Zorzal very effectively used a similar tactic to literally hunt the Warrior Bunnies to the brink of extinction. What Molto failed to realize, even after Sugawara's statement of fact, is that Japan (and most of the world on the other side of the gate) has <em>thousands</em> of years of experience dealing with, and retaliating against this particular ploy. Molto would be rudely awakened by a pair of F-4EJ Kai Phantoms IIs playing the role of the swords of the gods, and blowing up the Senate building.</li><li> In the National Diet, Senator Kouhara sees Rory's young looks and dark clothes with veil and assumes she's a child in mourning and picks her as easy prey for her criticism of the JSDF. Turns out she picked on a <strong>very old</strong> demigod who proceeds to shut her down hard.</li><li> Zorzal shares his dad's ideas despite getting a red ass beatdown.</li><li> Itami manages to avoid this in the arc that occurs from chapter 49 to chapter 52 of the manga by carefully double-checking his otaku knowledge against Rory's knowledge of the "mythical" creatures his group encounters. Rory is duly impressed.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yaoi Fangirl</a>: Risa has quite a collection of gay-themed manga, explicit enough to shock Tomita when he absentmindedly picks up a random book.

She also has a notably bigger bust, when in the manga, she was flat enough that Pina joked that she wasn't sure if Hamilton was a boy or girl. It's not extreme, but it is increased in size.</li><li> Sherry is redesigned for the anime, and ends up looking almost like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Silica</a> instead. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag">And they got</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RinaHidaka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RinaHidaka">Rina Hidaka</a> to voice Sherry.</li></ul></li><li> In the anime, the Imperial characters don't wear togas like they do in the novels and manga, instead wearing medieval clothing. There, they are more of the formal court dress, rather than the casual wear, so they <em>do</em> appear in the court scenes in Episodes 2 and 11.</li><li> House Formal's demihuman maids also change greatly, especially Persia.</li><li> Grey is bald and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">notably rotund</a> in the manga, but has blonde buzzcut and is more muscular in the anime.
