It wasn't until long after her death that he learned that at the time she was simply too drunk to realize that the guy she was kissing wasn't him.<ul><li> In the last book, the girl actually admits she did know who she was kissing, that it was on purpose, that she WAS supposed to have been in a monogamous-couple relationship with Magnus, and that it was just a stupid moment of flightiness, that it didn't really "mean anything" (if deep kissing over a period of a minute can "mean nothing"), and that Magnus "overreacted." She also implied that Magnus actually saw them making out and maybe even reaching second base, not just kissing lightly. So, this really brings <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralValuesDissonance">Moral Values Dissonance</a> into play. She basically cheated on him as she admitted that they were supposed to have been a monogamous couple, and that he should "just get over [being cuckolded]." Instead, it should have been the "you never asked me out, and we never agreed to be a couple" angle, which would make much more sense that she would still feel open to "playing the field", and put the onus on Magnus for overreacting when it was his fault for being possessive and assuming. But Feist inexplicably chose the former route, making the girl look like a cheating tramp trying to brush off the emotional damage cheating can give, rather than an empowered woman standing up for her right to not be beholden to a particular man just because the man has unilaterally declared her his property. But given how Feist treats his female characters in the latter books, this is not especially surprising.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">Moral Dissonance</a>: Many issues concerning the Moredhel. One particularly jarring scene involves two scouts deliberately leading a troop of Tsurani into a group of migrating Moredhel women and children. After dooming them to be cut to shreds, they talk in surprise about how unexpectedly pretty those Moredhel were for a race that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyEqualsGoodness">supposed to be evil.</a> While this could be a realistic depiction of the sort of enemy dehumanisation typical in prolonged warfare, one of the scouts, Martin, has been raised by Eledhel, whose moral uptightness is placed on a pedestal many times in the series. However, the Moredhel are not called the Brotherhood of the Dark Path for nothing - signs at least point to that Path being what keeps them from re-joining their kin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Ambition Is Evil</a>, much?<ul><li> One controversial issue is the Returning (i.e. when a Moredhel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">leaves behind their former life</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">embraces the ways of the eledhel</a>): <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceBrainwashing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceBrainwashing">Heel&#150;Face Brainwashing</a>? <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2bftw');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note2bftw" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2bftw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Taken at face value in the books, the Returning is held to be miraculous by the Eledhel, and considered the result of foul witchcraft and mind-manipulation by the Moredhel, not to mention a great tragedy. The Returning happens when a Moredhel is ready and chooses to let go of their old war-like ways and abandon the Dark Path. No non-Moredhel character in the books ever voices the opinion that the Returning is anything but a great thing to happen - not even the ones doing the Returning, despite how painful it must be for them. On the other hand, there are several details in the books that make it sound a bit suspicious. First there's the question of how and why a Moredhel with no prior exposure to the ways of the eledhel (and no way to even know what those ways even are, exactly) should <em>naturally</em> decide to abandon the entirety of the world-view they've been raised with and forsake their family and responsibilities and go buddy up with their ancestral enemies. Then there's the process of Returning, which involves the affected Moredhel starting to act odd and distant over a span of years, culminating in a single, sudden and, it seems, inevitable switch to eledhel, at which point they run for Elvandar - in other words, something that doesn't look like the result of natural changes in personality, but instead an affliction of sorts. On that note, there's the fact that the Returning is attributed (by Moredhel and Eledhel alike) to the "Call of Elvandar", i.e. its magic, which, as known from the books, is at least significantly shaped by the Spellweavers (the eledhel mages). There is evidence from <em>Magician</em> that the Spellweavers can discreetly manipulate a person's personality and suppress certain impulses, as they did with Tomas. (Them doing it en-masse would also explain how they can keep Elvandar a peaceful utopia, despite the moredhel and the eledhel being the same people.) Plus, trying to resist the Call is physically painful. And lastly there's the problem that the Call seems to naturally target more goodish/less Dark Path-heavy Moredhel. Since a Moredhel who Returns is removed from the Moredhel population, the Returning is obviously <em>getting in the way</em> of the Moredhel becoming less evil as a people. To support this, in the case of both of the Returned Moredhel we get to know in the books, it's quite likely that the Moredhel people would have been better off if they'd stayed. On the other hand, all pure-blooded elves seems magically drawn to Elvandar, not just the Moredhel, but even the star elves, whose existence was unknown to the Spellweavers, suggesting that this may not actually have been a result of deliberate brainwashing.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing">Mother Makes You King</a>: At the end of Mistress of the Empire, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mara puts her son Justin on the throne by marrying him to the daughter of the late Emperor, making him the next Emperor.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">Multiple-Choice Past</a>: Macros tells a couple of mutually exclusive backstories for himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a>: Feist's universe is made up of an extensive cosmology.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusiveMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutuallyExclusiveMagic">Mutually Exclusive Magic</a>: Magic in Feist's cosmology was originally set between two types of magic; Lesser Path (they get their power from books and artifacts) and Greater Path (they channel magic directly through their bodies).

The idea that they just got divorced offscreen with no indication anything was wrong is the classic "oh crap, I screwed up but I better make up some cock-and-bull story to sell the gullibles about how I really meant it" that George Lucas tries to throw people.</li></ul></li><li> The same book in which the above happened also had a major retcon in regards to the events of the Empire trilogy. In that series, every member of the Minwanabi family was killed or committed suicide due to an oath to the Red God having become impossible to fulfill. Mara of the Acoma broke tradition by taking control of the Minwanabi lands and servants, and due to destroying the Minwanabi her house would rise to the position of Great House. By the end of the series, Mara's son ise emperor, her daughter is heir to the Acoma, and the old Acoma estates have been given to a loyal retainer to start his own house: House Lujan. However, in the darkwar saga, it is instead stated that the Minwanabi became <strong>vassals</strong> to the Acoma, and are somehow still around and a Great House. The Acoma estates are considered imperial property that no one has lived in since Mara's son ascended to the throne. The emperor is considered part of House Acoma (despite the Empire trilogy making a major point of Mara's son no longer being a member of that house due to rising to the throne), with no mention of Kasuma. Since these are all such major retcons that they essentially break the story of the third book in the empire trilogy, Feist later tried to reconcile them through explanations on his blog. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">House Lujan died out quickly after it was established, its lands returning to the imperial family.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Mara restored House Minwanabi, presumably through its old retainers, and gave back their old lands.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What happened to Kasuma and House Acoma is still left unresolved though</a>.</li><li> A more minor example from the same book is the fact that the emperor of Kelewan appoints someone to the position of Warlord, a position that was renamed and reduced in power during the Empire Trilogy.</li><li> Considering how many times we've had to revise our understanding of just <em>one</em> universe in our history, it's reasonable that anyone in a magical metaverse is going to have theories and incomplete understanding at best... it just never happens in fantasy stories for some reason. And Macros? He just loves telling wild tales and seeing who bites.</li><li> Post-<em>Darkwar</em>, the cosmology largely seems to have stabilized; as laid out in <em>Magician's End</em>, it's basically a more detailed version of what we got in that series, rather than a retcon. <em>Magician's End</em> also makes a point that the cosmology is so complicated no human mind can wrap around it in any accuracy, leaving it easily open to say previous understandings were just wrong.</li><li> This gets oh-so-much worse that laid out above. Feist's books are fun and great fantasy reads, but he has even admitted he never goes back and re-reads his own work, and boy does it show! To wit:<ul><li> The title "Seignur" is introduced in Krondor, the Betrayal as some fancy, formal word for "Squire" and then never, ever used again. This title was used in the video game, but since it is so out-of-place and never referenced in any other book, it would have been better to just leave it as Squire James and Squire Locklear (or at least "Baron" or something we've seen and heard in other books).</li><li> Lucas (the innkeeper) mentions to James in Assassins that Talia is all he has left "with her brothers dead in the war", yet in Silverthorn we meet Lucas's sons (AFTER the war) when they leap over the bar to help Arutha and Jimmy catch their first nighthawk (where they plant the ambush in the Rainbow Parrot). They catch the nighthawk who turns out to be a Black Slayer and almost kills Arutha in the palace. But Lucas's sons are alive and well there. Unless they died in "The Great Uprising" of Murmandamus, this makes no sense. But if the latter were true, Lucas wouldn't have said "died in the war" (which everyone would take to mean the "Riftwar"). Also, the likelihood of two young veterans from Krondor being involved in, much less put into harm's way, during Murmandamus's attack (which came through Highcastle and attacked the Sethanon garrison) is minimal.</li><li> William is described at having a passionate affair with a "Jezharra", yet in Tear of the Gods she is introduced as "Jazhara".</li><li> William talks about a very strong broken-hearted romance with Jazhara, culminating in her untimely death. Yet, in Tear of the Gods, while William is described as having a puppy-dog-like infatuation with Jazhara when he was a young teenager in Stardock, William's ACTUAL tragic romance is with Talia. Also, Jazhara is both very much alive and very much at a friendly understanding with William (as in neither seem interesting in re-pursuing a romantic relationship) by the end of the book. Jazhara is described as dying roughly around 2-4 years after Tear of the Gods, so it is possible something blossomed, albeit being very out-of-character for the two, and then she dies off-screen, but this seems unlikely.</li><li> This might have been resolved by the short story "Jimmy and the Crawler" made as a plot-hole filler later, but it still doesn't explain why Talia is never mentioned as William's lost love story.</li><li> The Panthians are stated and even shown to have a hatred for humankind from birth, yet later we meet an entire subclan of Pantathians who harbor no ill will towards humans, and state that only the priesthood had antipathy to humans. But, does this mean that the priesthood are a separate race with separate genes that inflict their newborns with hatred for human kind? That seems unlikely.</li><li> As Caleb and Talon travel to Krondor from Sorcerer's Isle, Caleb explains to Talon that there is peace in the west. He mentions that the daughter of King Ryan is to be wed to the nephew of the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpRESS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpRESS">Emp RESS</a> of Kesh. This is despite the fact that we know Diigai has become emperor after Lakeesha's death, based on the events in Prince of the Blood. We further know from the events in Flight of the Nighthawks that Diigai is still the emperor then, many years after the events in this book. Thus, Kesh cannot have an Empress, because the ruler is Diigai, a man. It's possible that, as in some Imperial rulerships in real life, the wife of the ruling Emperor is called "Empress", but this doesn't really shake out well here, because talking about the "nephew of the Empress of Kesh" implies the Empress is the important anchor point in the relationship. Wouldn't he normally say "the nephew of the emperOR of Kesh" if the emperor was the one in charge? Instead, he identifies the empress, giving the solid impression that Kesh is ruled by a woman, which we know from the timeline is incorrect, as when Lakeesha's reign ended, Diigai, her son-in-law, took power, passing on to Sezioti, his grandson.</li><li> Kaspar is described to have a son in Talon of the Silver Hawk, yet we later see he is childless in King of Foxes. This may have been a simple misconception on Talon's part, as he indicates this was a simple guess based on the boy and Kaspar's likeness. However, Talon is repeatedly shown to not only have a very well-trained eye, but to be a master at human nature. As for this boy, he is never shown again, nor mentioned again. He is never seen at the citadel, or as part of Kaspar's retinue. He simply vanishes, despite Talon having marked him as Duke Kaspar's son, and thus as someone notable in appearance and manner. In later editions of the book, this missing son apparently has been excised in editing.</li><li> Talon is described as having very little affection for Svetlana, the Princess of Salmater, when he is forced to assassinate her on Duke Kaspar's orders. He has misgivings, but he describes her as vicious and without scruples in her own way. He is never described as being infatuated or in love with her. Yet, in Exile's Return, he describes her assassination as haunting his dreams and as carrying a very profound regret. Where did these strong feelings come from, for a man who never seemed to have that many regrets at the time of the action?</li><li> At several points starting with Exile's Return, Pug and company imply that the _Riftwar_ (not the "Great Uprising" that followed it) was part of the plot of the Pantathians to free the Dragon Lords from their imprisonment, yet that makes no sense. The Riftwar was due to politics on the Tsurani homeworld and nothing was mentioned of any Pantathian interference or plots to encourage the invasion until Exile's Return. It also makes no sense how the Pantathians could have influenced Tsurani politics from across time and space, as there was no contact with the Tsurani until the Riftwar. This just reeks of colossal retcon. Later on, they imply that Nalar influenced the Tsurani to invade in order to further his plans of chaos, but this retcon of a retcon still just doesn't fit.</li><li> Kaspar suddenly has a daughter in Flight of the Nighthawks, when he describes himself as having no siblings when comparing his own experiences to the two Keshian princes vying for the throne. He also states that his daughter "Natalia" also was an only child. This is quite a contradiction to the Conclave series, where Natalia is Kaspar's sister. In Realm, she again assumes her rightful place as his sister.</li><li> Again with Kaspar in Wrath of a Mad God: During his sojurn with the sun elves on the Peaks of the Quor, he is described as never having had any but the most cursory contact with any elves (specifically stated to be limited to an envoy at Sorcerer's Isle and even then he only had a fleeting glance). Yet, in Exile's Return, Kaspar himself visited Elvandar with Pug, and he met with both Aglaranna and Tomas! He had the most direct contact with the elves as possible! He met with their leaders, participated in a major battle when Varen attacked Elvandar, and aided in the recovery. This is as shocking a contradiction as him losing a sister and gaining a daughter! It's even more strange as he then proceeds to speak with fairly intimate knowledge on how Aglaranna fairly treats with other Elven nations (such as the sea elves in Novindus) who aren't under her direct reign. He could have learned through Pug, but he speaks as if one who has actually met Aglaranna and has seen how she deals with her fellow elves firsthand (as he actually did in Exile's return, which would make sense except for the contradiction in the proceeding paragraph). This is made even more stark when he tells Jim Dasher to introduce him to Tomas, saying he only knows him by reputation. Reputation? The two of them fought side-by-side in Exile! Kaspar has not only met Tomas before, but they talked, and were very friendly by the end of their time together.</li><li> In Wrath, the Duke of Crydee is described as being "Lester", but a few chapters later, the Duke of Crydee is referred to as "Henry" and then "Harry". Presumably "Harry" is a nickname for "Henry", but "Duke Lester" changing to "Lord Henry"? This was in even the same book!</li><li> Laromendis, the Star Elf is portrayed as being a known member of the Circle of Light, as a suspected member of the Circle of Light, as one of the prominent members, or as an adjunct, all at different points in the story. Which was he? He was originally portrayed as one of the leaders, hence why he wasn't executed along with the rest of the Circle, but then he is portrayed as a minor member or as a peripheral member, and later in Imperiled, as only a SUSPECTED member. Gulomendis is sometimes stated to have also been in the circle, but other times said to not have been.</li><li> In Legion, Sandreena is attacked by the Black Caps, knocked unconscious and then beaten and thrown off a cliff. There is never any indication or sign or thought that she was sexually assaulted. Yet in Besieged, she states that the black caps attacked her, raped her, and left her for dead, which is a major contradiction. This is a woman supersensitive to her anatomy and gender, and all the inequalities it entails in her universe. If she had realized she had been raped in Legion, she would have brought it up and launched into a tirade-monologue about the evils of all men. And if she didn't know she was raped then, how does she know now? And to just casually throw rape around like it's some kind of minor insult or an afterthought, is in itself a pretty insulting and offensive way to write a novel.</li><li> Talon's son is introduced as "Tyrone Hawkins", even though we were previously introduced to him in Realm as "Laughter in His Eyes", or "Laff" for short. Now, with a nickname like that, it would be little wonder he would want to change it, but there is never any indication given that this took place. There is also no indication at all that he underwent his tribe's traditional re-naming ceremony (like how Keililapauna became Talon of the Silver Hawk), nor is there any indication he was raised with Orosini principles at all. His name is just suddenly different with no explanation given. In fact, he tells Hal directly "My father gave me this name" which contradicts Orosini tradition for a name change, where the new name is given by the Gods (or by the person himself).</li><li> Arkan is introduced as Gorath's son despite Gorath telling James that all of his sons were killed during the plot of Betrayal, and that he left no family (aside from Cullich, whom we meet later) behind. It is also never mentioned during Betrayal, when Gorath met with Liallin, that the two are brother and sister-in-law, or that Liallin's sister, Clothild, was Gorath's wife.</li><li> In Imperiled, Jim Dasher describes himself as "never having been in love" before Fredericka, completely forgetting that he was head over heels mad in love with Feist's misogynistic symbol extraordinaire, Michelle back in the Darkwar series. Could be that Jim just didn't WANT to remember, but the way it was phrased doesn't seem like that ever happened, especially considering how important it was to Jim at the time. One would think Jim would have at least remembered it with some measure of exasperation or humiliation.</li></ul></li><li> And of course, the obvious Isle of the Snakes fiasco, where Pug goes and meets T'kaa and interacts with the remaining Pantathians, only to have it switch to Magnus going to the Isle of Snakes later in the same book, and then back again in the last book! Feist has admitted to the editing error.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">Ret-Gone</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">Un-person</a>: The ultimate goal of the harshest sentence for traitors to the Empress of Kesh is to ensure that their soul be forever alone, forgotten even by The Gods. To that end, the traitor's name is erased from the written records and forbidden to any child of noble birth. They are personally Excommunicated by the high priest of the chief god of the Keshian faith and denied entry into their afterlife. After this is done, any time someone must speak of a person who underwent this punishment, they do so indirectly, by referring to the person in question as "One Whose Name Has Been Forgotten" or "One Who Betrayed His Country".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobeAndWizardHat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobeAndWizardHat">Robe and Wizard Hat</a>: Most of Feist's magicians do favor robes, though only Kulgan is said to have a special wizarding hat.
