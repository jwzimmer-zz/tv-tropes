His heroes Old Shatterhand and Winnetou are very famous literary characters in Europe and quintessential examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>. Although May only travelled to America himself after his novels became successful, the novels are famed for their accuracy in geographic terms. All trips and journeys of the main character can be followed in an atlas. Accuracy of many other things is not to be taken for granted.</p><p>The character who is here called "Charlie" or "Old Shatterhand" previously featured in May's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle">Orient Cycle</a></em>, in which he adventured in the Middle East under the name of "Kara Ben Nemsi".</p><p>Several of the novels have film adaptations made in Germany in the sixties. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTreasureOfSilverLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTreasureOfSilverLake">The Treasure of Silver Lake</a></em> was the first film of the series; it proved successful enough and spawned a film series.

Tahua is probably the best example in the Wild West. Ntscho-tschi, Winnetou's sister, also qualifies. And Kah-o-oto and young Ashta are not far behind. Ellen, Ribanna's daughter in an earlier version of "Old Firehand", was trained by Winnetou himself since early childhood.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionMom">Action Mom</a>: Tahua, who could beat a chief in a duel, among many other accomplishments.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a>: People tend to make Old Shatterhand look a lot more like a hunk than he was in the novels. He is always taller in adaptations, and rarely sports a beard, or tattered clothes for that matter.<ul><li> Inverted with Winnetou, who is <em>never</em> as breath-takingly drop-dead gorgeous and imposing as he is in the books.

In the films <em>Old Surehand</em> and <em>Der &Ouml;lprinz</em> he is much younger and merely Old Surehand's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingSidekick">clumsy comical sidekick</a>.<ul><li> Sam Hawkens in the books is one of the best white scouts there are, and Charlie credits him with being his second best teacher after Winnetou (and the first to teach him the ways of the West). His eccentric ways are often simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>.

The same goes for Old Shatterhand (and other secondary characters), but they don't get even a hint of a description, and even in Winnetou's case they are minimalistic and focused on his actions rather than his looks.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>: Intschu-tschuna, chief of the Apaches.

And crying.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a>: Old Wabble; his final fate is so horrific that you cannot help but share Old Shatterhand's feelings on it, and be relieved at his last-moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel&#150;Face Turn</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>: Rattler isn't alone among the surveyors in his propensity to drink, but in his case, his irresponsible drunken behaviour leads to truly tragic consequences for other characters (and ultimately, him).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBeerIsAle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllBeerIsAle">All Beer Is Ale</a>: Averted. Old Shatterhand seems to prefer Pilsner, which is a type of pale lager.

Practically everybody else, in fact.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">An Axe to Grind</a>: Tomahawks are the cultural weapon for apparently <em>all</em> Native American tribes. Also, some of the few times Old Shatterhand is deadly in a fight happens when he uses a tomahawk (during actual battle, not a duel), due to the nature of the weapon not really lending itself much to being used by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncestralWeapon">Ancestral Weapon</a>: The Silver Rifle, which Winnetou picks up after his father's death.

Winnetou is a less clear case, but Charlie associates him with black panthers (explicitly) and with ravens and black horses (implicitly).

A common misconception <em>in-story</em> is that "Old Shatterhand" had acquired his nickname on the basis of great stature and physical strength (while May himself had been a small thin guy). In fact, whenever there is a description of Old Shatterhand in the text, he is described as being "average height, average build", with "hands as slender and as white as a woman's", making his strength come off as even more of a surprise.

He grows into it very quickly, though.<ul><li> On a Meta level, Karl May himself might be considered this. He definitely became as moral as Old Shatterhand by the end of his life.

Their logic was that a spear was an uncommon weapon for a white man. Which, on one hand, at that particular point in history was sort of true. What's more, Old Shatterhand himself wasn't particularly fond of the weapon and gives them points for trying. On the other hand, everyone involved severely underestimated the lengths of Winnetou's patience when it came to teaching Old Shatterhand something that might save his life someday. According to the man himself, "Poor Winnetou went to a lot of pains to teach me how to handle [a spear]." It shows, though by the time they get to the actual duel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterArchetype">Old Shatterhand</a> has already employed enough psychological warfare to make it more of a formality.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">Blasphemous Boast</a>: Some of the bad guys are prone to this.

Old Shatterhand's "Henry carbine" actually packs "only" twenty-five shots into a magazine that's apparently complex enough that few if any enemies who manage to get hold of the gun ever figure it out, but because that's still a lot of shots between reloads and he rarely needs to expend them all before topping it off again a number of his more superstitious adversaries &mdash; especially those who only know him by reputation &mdash; do end up convinced that the weapon is somehow magical and a straight example of the trope, and he in turn takes full advantage of that misconception quite a few times.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraidsBeadsAndBuckskins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraidsBeadsAndBuckskins">Braids, Beads and Buckskins</a>: Played absolutely straight in the movies, with a little more variation in the books (for example, Winnetou never wears any sort of beads, feathers (even though he's a chieftain) or war paint.

Mostly because he actually does buy clean new clothes and the like every so often, uses his <em>nom du guerre</em> only when he means to impress (and his plain old German given name otherwise), isn't above sometimes coming up with a quick fib about his identity for various reasons, and of course for all the fame attached to his name most people still simply <em>don't know what the actual man behind it actually looks like</em>. And what he looks like is actually not very impressive - an unassuming, average-sized, friendly and polite young man, with hands that seem to be "as delicate as a woman's" does not exactly lead a seasoned westman to believe this is Old Shatterhand, who everybody imagines to be at least a 7-feet tall mass of muscles.

The antagonists in the movie adaptations tend to covet them and try to steal them from our noble heroes.

Somewhat justified in that many characters especially in the West are in fact presented as wilderness-savvy scouts and hunters who know quite well how to do just that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpectingSomeoneTaller">Expecting Someone Taller</a>: Most folks who meet Old Shatterhand for the first time.

Old Shatterhand is more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantToTheEnd">Defiant to the End</a> type if he's irritated enough, but if his attackers treat him respectfully, he responds by not insulting them. But the award on this one must go to Winnetou, who not only predicts his own death with painful clarity and makes plans for both his own burial and the fulfillment of his will, but has to face Charlie's tearful denial and despair at the news to boot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">Famed in Story</a>: Winnetou and Old Shatterhand, most prominently, and people also know their horses and guns. They are respected wherever they go.<ul><li> Occasionally subverted, at least temporarily. Not everybody appreciates having those two around, and we're not talking about the bad guys here. Winnetou and Old Shatterhand tend to steal the spotlight in whatever group they're in, and other westmen, either truly experienced or mere wanna-bes, sometimes have problems with listening to their advice, taking orders from them or accepting their merciful views in battle. It goes for both white people and native tribes, in fact some of the most interesting parts of the (unabridged) books are the ways they manage to deal with such situations. Just because they are pretty much always right does not mean they can always prevent others from doing stupid things and getting hurt while trying to make a point.</li><li> Other characters as well: for example, in <em>The Spirit of Llano Estacado</em>, the characters previously featured in <em>The Son of the Bear-Hunter</em> are now famous in the West thanks to the events of that story. Word of mouth is described as powerful around the campfires in the West. And Old Shatterhand is often just as thrilled to meet other famous westmen as they are to meet him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyOfChoice">Family of Choice</a>: Winnetou and Old Shatterhand, choosing each other over literally everyone else, including other relatives and love interests (Charlie), and even God, sort of (Winnetou).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestGunInTheWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestGunInTheWest">Fastest Gun in the West</a>: Usually averted, in that the gun duels make use of rifles, there is a counting procedure and a certain number of shots that can be fired.

Winnetou takes it one step further and adapts the name to "Scharlih", which Old Shatterhand seems to be positively enamored with. The fact that the change comes at a distinctly dark and painful moment for Winnetou (after his father and sister are murdered) as well as the contextual conversation where this happens only serve to deepen the meaningful development of their relationship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>: In Karl May's early serialized stories Winnetou had a distinct darker, more savage side, but at the years passed the author idealized his hero more an more until he finally became a Christ-like figure and the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Noble Savage</a>.

It comes up often in his dreams <em>and</em> his daydreams. His love for fast horses is closely linked to this, as it's the closest he can physically get to flying. His descriptions of night rides through the desert literally read like transcendental religious experiences.<ul><li> It takes a physical form with Young Eagle's early-type airplane in "Winnetou IV". Both Old Shatterhand and Tattelah-Satah want to fly with it.</li><li> Also from "Winnetou IV", Sascha Schneider's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> painting of Winnetou flying/ascending to Heavens is heavily featured as a plot turning point. (It often serves as a front cover for the novel as well.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowerMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowerMotifs">Flower Motifs</a>: The Passiflora (Passion-flower) appears a lot in the Wild West stories, but the most significant instance happens in "Winnetou IV", where Old Shatterhand finds a secluded cave within Tattelah-Satah's "stone castle", overflowing with white and red Passiflora, planted there by Winnetou's own hand decades ago. The flowers form a giant white cross on a red background. The symbol of the cross, of course, was wide-spread well before Chrstianity was even a thing, and Native American tribes used it too, but Winnetou specifically chose it because it reminded him of Old Shatterhand, and he hoped to better understand his brother's faith "as the flowers grow". In Europe, the Passiflora is susually associated with "passion" (as in Christ-level of pain and suffering), "endurance" (again with the suffering, but also <em>surviving</em> it), the Cross, the Holy Grail, but also "strong emotion, desire" and "divine love". All these are strongly related to Winnetou, both as Charlie's dearest friend and as a demigod-like figure to his people.<ul><li> In the Orient cycle, we also find out Old Shatterhand's favourite flower: the violet. Called the "Flower of Modesty", associated with the Virgin Mary, with Athena, Artemis and Persephone, violets are a symbol of faithfulness, a symbol of purity and protection against evil, but also of death (especially brought to the graves of innocents, such as children or those who died young). Their (quite real) curative properties were conflated until they became a cure-all for any diseases of the body or of the soul. (Also, apparently , used as an aphrodisiac and believed to represent the ultimate chemistry between lovers.) And then there is the violet's association with Sappho, the great poet of Lesbos... and "Sappho" just happened to be Charlie's nickname while he was in school.</li><li> Also in the Orient cycle, it's revealed that Halef's favourite flowers are roses, which symbolize love, passion, bravery, but also pride and rank.</li><li> The scabiosa - symbol of unfortunate love - that Martha Voegel wears in her hair during her first concert. She is in love with Old Shatterhand, but their romance is never fulfilled (by his choice).</li><li> The oak (generally associated with Germany) makes an appearance as acorns are planted around the grave of Klekih-Petra (who was German).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowerInHerHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlowerInHerHair">Flower in Her Hair</a>: Martha Vogel chooses to wear a scabiosa (or pin-cushion flower) in her hair during her first concert. It symbolizes an "unfortunate love" (her love for Old Shatterhand). It's not made clear whether she chose that flower on purpose to give him a sign, or if Fate was mocking her before letting her know her love was truly doomed. (In either case, he does notice the flower.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FolkHero">Folk Hero</a>: In real life, Old Shatterhand and Winnetou are this in Germany and most of Europe.<ul><li> In universe, Old Shatterhand and Winnetou are in the first stages of the myth-building in the Wild West.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenZone">Forbidden Zone</a>: If you want to be absolutely sure that Charlie will end up in a certain place, slap this name on it. He will be onto it at the speed of light. After taking all necessary (and sometimes unnecessary) precautions, and drafting several back-up plans, of course. (He is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster">The Trickster</a> of the series for nothing.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a>: In "Treasure of the Silver Lake", Charlie and some companions fall prisoners to the Utahs. They are forced to watch as other prisoners, who were hardened criminals, were brutally tortured with knives and eventually killed with dogs. They avert their eyes, but can't also cover their ears...<ul><li> In "Satan and Iscariot", Charlie tells Emery Bothwell about one of his and Winnetou's earlier adventures, which included them and a group of travellers suffer from thirst while crossing the Llano Estacado. While weakened, they are all captured by the Comanches. While there was no current conflict, the Comanches decide to burn them at the stake anyway. They start by killing the other travellers, while Winnetou and Charlie are forced to watch. Their fury at the sight gives them the needed impulse to not only escape in an extremely bold manner, but also that they come back to take <em>revenge</em> &mdash; one rare exception to their usually "forgiving-your-enemies" policy. For his part, Emery is more creeped out by Charlie's calm and casual retelling of the events, which in themselves were unusually gory.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCorrespondent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCorrespondent">Foreign Correspondent</a>: What Charlie is sent to work as in the beginning of the "Satan and Iscariot" trilogy.

It's the sort of scar that should make him instantly recognizable by anyone who knows the story (lots of people), but since it's in such a hard to spot place (practically under his jaw) and he often sports a beard, you'd have to already suspect who you're talking to in order to even think to check for it. There is apparently also a small one on his arm from the blood-brother ritual with Winnetou, but it only shows up once, in one of the latter stories, and Winnetou <em>still</em> doesn't seem to have one. (Also, the account of the ritual specifically mentions that the blood-letting came from an insignificant, superficial prick of the knife, that by all rights <em>shouldn't</em> leave any sort of scar, especially not one recognizable after so many years). A more classic example appears when Old Shatterhand meets Sans-Ear and has to prove who he is. Sans-Ear knew the story of Charlie's encounter with a particularly angry grizzly bear who had surprised him in his sleep and had wounded him pretty badly before getting killed. Charlie promptly does a half-striptease (he has to go through three layers of nice clothing to get to skin) to provide the evidence: a scar that goes pretty much diagonally across his torso, from shoulder to the opposite hip. (He is also quick to point out that Winnetou was the one responsible for neatly putting back together what appears to have been a pretty bloody mess.) He also takes a bullet to the thigh in "Old Surehand" which presumably ended up in a new scar, but we only see the wound while it's still new.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWithNumbers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWithNumbers">Good with Numbers</a>: Old Shatterhand is a very skilled engineer.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">Graceful Loser</a>: Intschu-tschuna, once the situation is explained to him, holds no grudge towards Old Shatterhand for beating him in their duel.<ul><li> Old Shatterhand himself, though he practically never <em>loses</em> a contest or battle (except on purpose).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigLibraryOfEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatBigLibraryOfEverything">Great Big Library of Everything</a>: Tatellah-Satah has one, though it stays off-page.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreekFire">Greek Fire</a>: It never appears in-story, but apparently Winnetou had invented something like this during his youth (before the start of the series).

Both have loved a woman very deeply, but both have lost them, so they only have one another as family which adds to the closeness. They call each other "my brother" and they always read each other's thoughts.<ul><li> In the books, Winnetou was in love with Ribanna when he was still a teenager, and the circumstances in which he lost her were a lot more tragic. And while Old Shatterhand cared a lot for Nsho-Tchi, respected her and admired her, he wasn't in love with her. And wasn't interested in marriage with <em>anyone</em> at that point, anyway. So by the time they meet, and especially after Winnetou's family dies, they are each other's <em>everything</em>. In fact, Winnetou himself tells Old Shatterhand, shortly after the murder: "You know what I have lost. From now, you be my father and my sister. I beg of you, Scharlih."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a>: Winnetou never gives you the feeling of being shallow.

A lot of time, a given word to stay put is the only thing that holds Old Shatterhand in place, when iron chains fail to do the trick.<ul><li> In a way, this is responsible for Winnetou's death too, since he refuses to lose his self-respect by trying to avoid his foreseen death. And it's the reason why Old Shatterhand doesn't simply knock him out and stash him somewhere safe until the danger passes &mdash; he is well aware that Winnetou would crumble morally under the guilt.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeBringer">Hope Bringer</a>: Old Shatterhand &mdash; explicitly so by "Winnetou IV".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpringsEternal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpringsEternal">Hope Springs Eternal</a>: Old Shatterhand's personal philosophy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseJump">Horse Jump</a>: Hatatitla and Iltschi occasionally do this. In "Holy Night!", Old Shatterhand led an entire tribe of Upsarokas on a rather wild chase through their own camp, where he had been brought as a prisoner together with his companions. During the chase, Old Shatterhand has his hands tied behind his back and his feet tied under Hatatila's belly, making his hair-rising running around and through tents and other obstacles twice as dangerous &mdash; and that's not counting the Natives chasing him. (They pretty much trash the camp, too. Feathers and bits of cloth flying everywhere.) They jump over various objects, bushes, tree trunks, low stone walls, through a couple of small forests, and back to the camp, stopping on <em>exactly the same spot he initially left from</em>, while his 6oo followers skid and pant to a much less graceful abrupt stop around him.<ul><li> In "Old Surehand", a tied-up Apanatschka gets his own Crowning Moment of Awesome when he manages a very dangerous and spectacular horse jump over Old Wabble, who is also on horseback at the time. The point of the skirmish had been to remove Old Wabble from between Apanatschka and his mother. Old Shatterhand, who had been the protagonist of an impressive horse trick himself just a bit earlier, comments that Apanatschka's jump was much more ambitious than his own had been, and he was more than a little worried for his friend, not so much for the jump itself, but for the <em>landing</em> afterwards, which is always the most dangerous part.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsebackHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsebackHeroism">Horseback Heroism</a>: Surprisingly averted, considering how important the heroes' horses are to the story. Old Shatterhand and Winnetou usually <em>plan</em> their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moments thoroughly and thus tend towards more subtlety.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsingAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsingAround">Horsing Around</a>: Played with. Hatatitla and Iltschi are very loyal and docile with their masters. Anyone else, though, is in for a world of pain and humiliation. Most Native-American-bred horses tend to be very difficult to manage even if you <em>are</em> familiar with their particular training routine. On the other hand, a lot of the White hunters have odd-looking, nag-ish horses that no one in their right mind would even try to steal, who prove to be dangerously capable to their owners and <em>so</em> plain dangerous to strangers that <em>Old Shatterhand</em> doesn't even try to get close to, say, Sans-Ear's mare, Tony.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">Humans Are Flawed</a>: No one's perfect, not even Old Shatterhand and Winnetou.

It all starts with "Old Shatterhand", which is of course the nickname given to him by his white companions, and then this nickname got translated into pretty much every Indin dialect of every tribe he has ever encountered (or, after a while, who has ever heard of him). So we have Selki-Lata/Selkhi-Lata (Mescalero Apache), Nonpay-Klama (Shoshones), Pokai-Mu (Utah), Tave-Schala (Yuma), Nina Nonton, Ka-Ut-Skamasti, and so on. Then there are the variations of his given name, Carl, which he adapts into Charley/Charlie/Charles/Carlos, and is usually reserved for friends. (Special mention goes here to Winnetou's "Scharlih", which is the Apache's affectionate way of (mis)pronouncing Charlie.) He also uses aliases whenever he thinks the situation requires it, such as Mr. Jones, M&auml;rz, Mr. Beyer, Meier/Mayer, Mr. German, and in one amusing case of trying to mislead someone, Old Firefoot. Moving to South America, we have Arriquez, Tocaro, El Rastreador, El Sendador. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle">Orient Cycle</a> offers even more names.<dl><dd><ul><li> Adding to all that, in the US-version of Karl May's books from 1898/99, everything German was made American, and the main character is called Jack Hildreth (though he is so far removed from the original he is literally another person).</li><li> And in "Weihnacht!", Carl's old school friend Carpio calls him Sappho, both while they were kids <em>and</em> after Old Shatterhand had become a famous name in the West.

And yes, he received the nickname because he also wrote nice poems.</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Winnetou himself almost never uses aliases, choosing rather to not give <em>any</em> name rather than spin a lie, but when he follows Charlie to Africa (loooong story), he lets Charlie pick a name for him - they go with Ben Asra, Somalian/Indian prince.

When his father tries to give him a few dollars as reward (not knowing who he is), an angry Winnetou intervenes and sets things straight. In fact, Old Shatterhand generally manages to avoid whatever rewards are thrown his way, including marriage arrangements; hilariously, he is a lot more demanding when it comes to his rights as an author.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a>: Old Wabble.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">Kick Them While They Are Down</a>: Done figuratively, but also quite literally, whenever Winnetou and Old Shatterhand happen to fall prisoners to whatever enemy they have at the time.

It underlines his resilience as well as his beauty, both exotic and classic (he's often compared to Ancient Roman statues).</li><li> Gold, whenever it enters the equation, comes with negative, blood-soaked connotations. It only becomes better when wielded by someone indisputably good, like Winnetou. For example, in "Holy Night!" he gifts a couple of people with golden nuggets for Christmas, and it's described as a pure gesture that doesn't seem to have any negative consequences (granted, what happens <em>before</em> that is pretty gruesome, and yes, it's bad because of that same gold).</li><li> Steel and Iron are often mentioned metaphorically, when describing people (Winnetou's incredible body) or animals (usually good horses). They always have positive connotations, related to strength, endurance, health, nerves and will.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>: White man's policy in <em>any</em> setting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyRoar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyRoar">Mighty Roar</a>: When discussing grizzly bears, the lion's roar is mentioned as being the preferable option to hear, as terrifying as it is.

The one constant trait that all "half-breeds" seem to posses is a certain predisposition towards hot-headed action. It's lampshaded by Harry, Old Firehand's son, when arguing with Old Shatterhand about revenge: "If you had Indian blood in your veins, you would understand!" (Despite this, in Karl May's later works, there is a certain tendency to view extensive metisation as a possible solution to achieve lasting peace between nations.)<ul><li> Old Surehand and Apanatschka are sons of a Moqui mother and a white (American) father. They are both highly skilled warriors, very clever and bold, and very well respected by most Westmen. Old Shatterthand and Winnetou are very fond of both of them and they remain close friends for life.</li><li> Old Firehand (German) and Ribanna (Assiniboin) have a son (Harry) and daughter (killed while she was still a baby). Harry is very bright and talented, despite his young age (somewhere around 16-18 years-old). Old Shatterhand is quite taken with him. (Notably, an earlier version of the story featured a girl (Ellen) instead of Harry. In that story, she was just as capable as a warrior &mdash; justified by her being Winnetou's niece, and Old Shatterhand ends up <em>marrying</em> her.)</li><li> Ik Senanda ("Evil Serpent") is the son of a white man and a Comanche woman and the grandson of Tokvi Kava ("The Black Mustang"). He is described as strong and clever, but also cruel and cunning. Though not quite cunning <em>enough</em> for Winnetou and Old Shatterhand. He is also suffering from severe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>, even towards his own grandfather, who seems to genuinely care for him.</li><li> Antonius Paper, also known as Okih-chin-cha, from "Winnetou IV".

And they never <em>stay</em> mounted for long. Horses are used for speedy chases, or for hunting. Realistically, trying to shoot someone while running at full horse-speed it's a bit on the difficult side.

Winnetou uses the unerring <em>Silberb&uuml;chse</em> (silver rifle), so named because it was decorated with silver stud-nails all over.

As Winnetou is killed in <em>Winnetou III</em> and <em>Winnetou IV</em> is very different in tone and subject from the previous three volumes (it relates of how Old Shatterhand, now in his 60s, returns to the Wild West to help erect a monument to his old companion and to oversee what happens to his legacy), the publishers retitled the fourth volume <em>Winnetous Erben</em> ("Winnetou's heirs") in 1914.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>: Old Shatterhand.

We also find out that, despite being a heavy smoker himself, he is not at all fond of the <em>hemp</em> they were smoking, which had an unfortunate side-effect of making him sneeze.

It starts to get ridiculous when he literally puts himself between Old Shatterhand and a murderously angry Tangua - while Old Shatterhand was tied at the stake and couldn't defend himself properly. It's a wonder if any readers remember by that point that those two were still supposed to be enemies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>: See above, only with a small twist on the "friendship" part.

The narratorial description manages to make it clear that he is <em>visibly</em> a badass, but other characters occasionally misjudge his lithe physique and beautiful features as "weak". Naturally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> that soon follows such observations sets things straight pretty damn fast.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromisedLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePromisedLand">The Promised Land</a>: America, in a way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudBeauty">Proud Beauty</a>: Judith Silberstein.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a>: Most of the Native American tribes.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuietOne">The Quiet One</a>: Winnetou.

The Scotsman Lord Castlepool in "Der Schatz Im Silbersee" is obsessed with making wagers and travels through the Wild West in search of adventure, paying his guides 50 Dollars per adventure.

After realizing that Martha had indeed kissed him in his sleep (a year before, but he's kind of slow when it comes to romance), and after Martha flees in panic, a deeply confused and conflicted Old Shatterhand runs after her, despite the huge summer storm that breaks over the city. He doesn't catch up with her, instead he is eventually forced to seek refuge under some huge linden trees when the storm turns out to be more like a second Flood. The continuous lightning making him anxious, he moves from his initial tree under another, while berating himself for being irrational, as there's no way to correctly predict a lightning strike &mdash; only for a big lightning bolt to strike and burn down the very tree he had been hiding under. Had he stayed put, he would have died. It serves as an eye-opener (what does his aching heart count against the will of God?). Suddenly feeling calm, he returns home, and gives up on Martha.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion">Sacrificial Lion</a>: Winnetou.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Say My Name</a>: Winnetou and Old Shatterhand will sometimes call each other's names &mdash; usually in joy, but there are a couple more dramatic instances.

Guess what one of the most common insults thrown in Winnetou and Old Shatterhand's faces is (usually when they do something clever to avoid fighting and bloodshed). Of course, one should take into account the whole Trickster symbolism associated with Old Shatterhand (he's a fox, while Winnetou tends more towards a raven).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">Scenery Porn</a>: Charlie gets rather descriptive when he is impressed by something.

Old Shatterhand himself tends to get comments along the lines of "puny weakling" whenever he undresses for a duel, but since his opponents tend to fall into the 8-feet-tall giants packed with muscles category, that doesn't really offer much real information about his own condition except, well, "smaller than them".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">Shrouded in Myth</a>: Kolma-Puschi, the Native warrior who belongs to no tribe and endlessly wanders the mountains and the plains.

Judging by an off-hand comment, part of them are used for his lemonade. On the symbolic level, though... you can't exactly call him "innocent", though he is definitely going out of his way trying to be good. "Eccentric" might be closer, but not in the classic head-in-the-clouds-can't-remember-the-time sense.

Naturally, some of them also know the languages of neighboring tribes. Most Indians are noted as skilled orators (especially tribes' chiefs or certain "medicine men"). And then there's Winnetou, who is usually such a silent type, but turns out to be the most skilled speaker of <em>all</em> men, red or white or whatever color you may please. Old Shatterhand (who is no slouch in the talking department himself) is always awestruck whenever he gets to hear Winnetou speak for longer than 5 minutes.

This happens in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OrientCycle">Orient Cycle</a>, though Winnetou is mentioned in the beginning.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>: Both Winnetou and Old Shatterhand tend to show their anger on occasion (see whenever they have to deal with Santer), but on the whole, Old Shatterhand is usually the one more cold-blooded when genuinely pissed off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a>: A requisite opening of all duels in the Wild West.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeCover">Tree Cover</a>: Used all the time whenever someone is sneaking around. There are the occasional subversions, in that not all trees are actually wide enough to hide a man's body, and other cover options must be found. Also useful when someone shoots at you. Most significantly, a tree saves Old Shatterhand's life in "Winnetou III", when a surprise encounter in the woods with an unseen foe leaves him a bit defenseless. Luckily, the shooter turns out to be Winnetou, and everyone makes it out unharmed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterArchetype">Trickster Archetype</a>: If you step back and take a <em>really</em> good look at Old Shatterhand, you realise he's this, especially after he grows up a bit. He's always much more clever than the people around him, he's a consummate liar with a frightfully innocent face, is a truly honest man who nevertheless is willing to occasionally use (somewhat) dishonest means to reach his goals (though usually only when lives are on the line), always favors cunningness and yes, trickery instead of brute strength, if it <em>does</em> come down to using brute strength he is always able to somehow defeat much more powerful adversaries, is using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> as often as he can, mostly to obtain information, does not admit to his true identity for various reasons, and sometimes just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheLulz">For the Lulz</a>. He is often accused of having made a deal with the Devil/Evil Spirit because of how things always go his way. Both friends and enemies have called him "as cunning as a fox". (On a meta level, author Karl May must have been well-acquainted to the tales of Reineke the Fox, and was something of a real-life Trickster figure himself.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>: Winnetou and Old Shatterhand, plus whatever friends they gathered around at any given time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryAndFollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TryAndFollow">Try and Follow</a>: Old Shatterhand pulls this off occasionally. With a horse and riding skills like his, it's not exactly difficult.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwilightOfTheOldWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwilightOfTheOldWest">Twilight of the Old West</a>: In "Winnetou's Heirs".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a>: Most Plucky Comic Relief characters have one. Sam Hawkens' constant "If I'm not mistaken, hihi!" became a catchphrase. Old Wabble's "It's clear" comes close.<ul><li> It's mostly overlooked, but... count how many times Old Shatterhand says or thinks "that goes without saying". Or "what happened next can not be properly described".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncleTomfoolery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncleTomfoolery">Uncle Tomfoolery</a>: Bob suffers from this rather badly, especially in <em>The Son of the Bear Hunter</em>. He gets a lot better in <em>The Ghost of Llano Estacado</em>, where his only significant racial markers are his speech and his freed-slave backstory, only to mostly slip back again in <em>Old Surehand</em> (although at least by that point it's treated more realistically as his <em>personal</em> characteristics).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverCopReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverCopReveal">Undercover Cop Reveal</a>: Sort of. In "Winnetou III", Thick Fred Walker is an undercover detective as well as a legitimate Westman, but Charlie sees through his cover very quickly and warns him to be more careful. Then again, Charlie himself was quickly figured out by Old Death in "Winnetou II" as a more-or-less-undercover detective in search of a couple of fugitives &mdash; but he was still rather young and unexperienced back then.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderestimatingBadassery">Underestimating Badassery</a>: The sheer number of times someone underestimates either Winnetou or Old Shatterhand, or better yet, both...</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a>: Winnetou and Old Shatterhand. Even when one of them <em>does</em> physically die, his loyalty continues to act from beyond the grave.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsportsmanlikeGloating">Unsportsmanlike Gloating</a>: Something most bad guys are prone to, while Charlie and Winnetou strongly oppose. At one point in "Treasure of the Silver Lake", Winnetou is on the receiving end of one of these, from a particularly old and nasty enemy Indian chief.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>: It only happens twice in the entire series (not just the main trilogy), but Old Shatterhand can be downright frightening when <em>truly</em> pissed off.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOpeningScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOpeningScene">Villain Opening Scene</a>: In one of the side stories, "Captain Kaiman", which has Winnetou as a secondary character, but no Old Shatterhand.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption">Violence Is the Only Option</a>: Old Wabble tends to act this way, and without a minimal amount of planning too.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirtueIsWeakness">Virtue Is Weakness</a>: What a lot of people making a hard living in the harsh conditions of the Wild West think. And then along comes Old Shatterhand... much to everyone's despair...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionQuest">Vision Quest</a>: In a very abstract and metaphysical way, this is the reason why Charlie <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalksTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalksTheEarth">Walks The Earth</a>. But it's never quite explicitly stated in <em>any</em> of the printed 30-odd volumes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolleyingInsults">Volleying Insults</a>: Ususal prelude to duels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">The Western</a>: Filmed German style!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory">Walking Armory</a>: Many characters carry a wide collection of rifles, handguns and knifes. And whips, lassos, bolas, poisoned arrows, tomahawks and other exotic weapons. And then there's the most dangerous weapon of all, mostly because usually you don't see it coming: Old Shatterhand's <em>fist</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallOfWeapons">Wall of Weapons</a>: Intschu-tschuna has a large collection of Native (possibly ancestral) weapons on the walls of his room in the pueblo that gains Old Shatterhand's admiration. In "Winnetou IV", the "receiving room" in Tattelah-Satah's castle has a collection of weapons, most of them recognizable to Old Shatterhand because they used to belong to old acquaintances of his and Winnetou's.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: "Well, then. If my <em>brother</em> Colma-Puschi has to leave, I'm asking my <em>sister</em> Colma-Puschi to stay a while longer."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPieceOfJunk">What a Piece of Junk</a>: A lot of old weapons get this treatment, as well as a couple of less attractive horses. Naturally, in the hands of their owners, they are all worth their weight in gold.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenItRainsItPours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenItRainsItPours">When It Rains, It Pours</a>: Justified, as this tends to happen in the arid landscapes of the Southern US.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteHairBlackHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteHairBlackHeart">White Hair, Black Heart</a>: Old Wabble, who despite his age and his magnificent long silver hair is cruel, cynical, a shameless liar, a hypocrite, a thief, a racist and a killer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteStallion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteStallion">White Stallion</a>: A <em>big</em> no-no in the Wild West, since it makes the rider too conspicuous. Old Shatterhand has an entire inner monologue on the subject every time it crops up. He also points out the only situation where a white horse is acceptable in battle: if it's winter, and the rider also camouflages himself with a white sheet over his clothes.<ul><li> One of these is leading the mustang herd from which Sam Hawkens wants to catch a new ride for himself. He mistakenly thinks Old Shatterhand has his eyes on the white stallion and makes fun of him for it. (It's doubly funny because the reader has already seen Old Shatterhand opinion on it, and the unfairness of it all is hilarious.) They end up catching Mary the mule, who was the stallion's second-in-command.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholesomeCrossdresser">Wholesome Crossdresser</a>: Tante Droll (Aunt Droll) is famous as a "Westmann" who looks like a woman (fans are still divided between those who see him as just looking a bit feminine and those who see him as an outright transvestite). Old Surehand's mother is an example of a tough lady disguising herself as a man.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWilderness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildWilderness">Wild Wilderness</a>: All over the place, especially once they get into mountainous regions.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: What everyone thinks of Old Shatterhand and Winnetou, no matter how much they might want to personally strangle them.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotAlone">You Are Not Alone</a>: Winnetou manages to do this for Charlie... some 30 years after his death. Lampshaded by other characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourFavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourFavorite">Your Favorite</a>: After a hilarious fight with Old Shatterhand, Mister Henry the gunsmith makes a peace offering by inviting his former greenhorn to dinner:<div class="indent"> "Well, I'll make you a beer soup in the coffee machine. Isn't that your favorite? Now get going!"</div></li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSaidYouWouldLetThemGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouSaidYouWouldLetThemGo">You Said You Would Let Them Go</a>: Tangua tries to avoid keeping his word of releasing the Apache prisoners by doing a very literal interpretation of his agreement with Old Shatterhand. He isn't actively trying to kill them anymore; instead, he would let them die of hunger and thirst. Fortunately, it's not a problem for more than a quarter of a page before the <em>rest</em> of the Apaches come back and attack.</li></ul><hr>
