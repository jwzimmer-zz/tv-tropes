For while Lander offers a full range of courses to nearly all students, it also offers a small number of specialty classes to a very select few. Lander is home to the Hero Certification Program, a curriculum designed to develop student with superhuman capabilities, commonly known as Supers, into official Heroes.</p><p>Five of this year&#146;s freshmen are extra special. They have a secret aside from their abilities, one that they must guard from even their classmates. Because for every one person in the world with abilities they can control, there are three who lack such skill. These lesser super beings, Powereds as they are called, have always been treated as burdens and second class citizens.

He simply doesn't have the finesse to wield something more precise. Surprisingly, Cole agrees in principle and has a bat-like weapon made out of a super-dense material, which only someone as strong as Roy can carry and swing.

Sean keeps expecting Blake to start a fight to settle their differences once and for all. It also doesn't help that Sean is a Subtlety Hero, who are typically distrusted by the other Heroes.

Even when an order appears to be coming from Mary, she typically uses her telepathy to allow Nick to "think" to her what to say. Hershel is actually a pretty good tactician as well, although not nearly on Nick's level, having gotten plenty of practice during his years as a LARPer.

He also assumes that they're about evenly matched up with their opposite powers: Michael's regenerating ice armor can stand up to Vince's fire blasts, while Vince's agility and ability to melt Michael's ice blasts makes him untouchable.

Nick wants Alice to use her new power to press down on the opposing fighters, while pretending it's all Mary's doing (who <em>can</em> do it but would end up hurting them if she did).

While not very popular due to its non-glamorous nature, underhanded methods, and the fact that a substantial percentage of Subtlety students end up pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Face&#150;Heel Turn</a> after graduating, a well-trained Subtlety Hero can make a huge difference on any team of Heroes. Smart team leaders try to keep at least one Subtlety Hero in their roster, since going in blind into a situation is dangerous. An exam in <em>Year 3</em> demonstrates the effectiveness of Subtlety by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">allowing those students to solve a complex riddle that leads them to three code words. Each code word then shuts down a certain number of robotic enemies during the exam. Dean Blaine explains that this represents the Subtlety student dealing with those enemies ahead of time through planning and intelligence-gathering. Will, who discovers all three code words, ends up having to fight only a single robot and earns a near-perfect score</span>. However, for some prospective Heroes, whose abilities are non-combat-oriented, this is the only discipline, in which they have a chance of succeeding. This includes Will (Pendleton's top students thanks to his computer-like brain), Nick (nearly on par with Will but far more sneaky), and, surprisingly, Alice (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">possibly thanks to the fact that she unwittingly shares some genes with Pendleton, her uncle</span>). <em>Year 4</em> also reveals that one of the HCP deans is a former Subtlety Hero, the only one to ever be an HCP dean. During a student-Hero mixer in the same book, Gale (in a cameo from <em>Corpies</em>) approaches Alice and explains that someone with her set of skills would fit right in with her Elemental Fury team. When Alice points out that she's majoring in Subtlety, Gale explains that, after the "giant robot" crisis (see <em>Corpies</em>), she has learned the value of having a Subtlety Hero on hand. A Subtlety Hero, who can hold his or her own in a fight would be a perfect combination.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">He's Back</a>: Averted in <em>Year 4</em> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Captain Starlight</span>.

Some heal by removing all injuries. One's touch grants a temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> (which still leaves the person sore and doesn't remove long-term effects, such as scarring). Camille is actually an absorber, not a healer. She is able to take an injury and store it for later, before giving it back to someone else (this is why she has modified her uniform to allow her to quickly strip off to expose as much skin as possible, as her power requires skin-on-skin contact). They can also usually apply their healing powers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">themselves</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a>: During the second semester of Year 1, the alternative course is for those students, whose abilities are not directly linked to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldFisticuffs">Good Old Fisticuffs</a>. According to Coach Persephone, it's pretty rare for bad guys to engage in hand-to-hand combat anyway, so their training may, in fact, be more beneficial than Coach George's combat training for the other half of the class.

For example, Chad's power is the total control over his body and mind. It isn't much by itself, but total control of the body means that he can ingest massive amounts of minerals and have his body absorb them beyond a normal human's ability to do so, thus building super-strong muscles and super-dense bones. Total control of the mind means he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes">Super Reflexes</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a>.

She's an Absorber. She absorbs injuries and stores them, allowing her to inflict them on others at her leisure. Woe betide anyone who forgets or doesn't realize this, especially if they threaten Vince. She spends the entire first year flying under the radar, "collecting" various injuries in her capacity as a healer. She eventually explains the nature of her power to an opponent, who claims that he will no longer allow her to heal him and replenish her arsenal and will also reveal her secret to everyone else. As they find out later, the guy has kept quiet, unwilling to go into details about how he lost a fight to a girl.</li><li> In the next team match, Nick does his best to keep the others from using their new powers (or, at least, use them in such as way as to be undetectable), thus revealing them before Nick is ready.</li><li> During the intramurals in <em>Year 4</em>, the competitors have to balance out the need to win with the desire to keep an ace up their sleeve.

For example, when entering the actual maze (the star attraction), there are a number of doors that people can go through. When the students split into groups and head off through different doors, they find themselves in different rooms (with no doors), but not with the people they entered with. They guess that the doors are actually portals that randomize the groups to add an unexpected element into the experience. Finding a way out requires navigating through various themed rooms and solving the puzzles there. The staff also uses the portals to avoid having to build an extensive network of secret passages (thus allowing the maze to be larger).</li><li> There's also the Labyrinth challenge during their first year, involving students being dumped at random locations and being forced to largely navigate in the dark (although some rooms are lit).

Mary is, potentially, the strongest in the world, but she still lacks proper focus and training, as demonstrated in Year 2 by a professor (an old lady) with the same power set, who easily trounces Mary and even demonstrates things that Mary can only dream of (such simultaneously controlling dozens of separate objects). Alex is a little strange about his power, which appears to be a weaker version of Mary's. However, there is one thing that he can do that no other telekinetic can't - manipulate energy. This may have something to do with their mindset, as other telekinetics focus on directly manipulating objects, which depends on their mass, and energy has no mass. Alex thinks he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Jedi</a>, so his method involves him calling out to the Force (he explains that, if he tries to focus on direct manipulation, it doesn't work), which somehow allows him to affect energy as well. When a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">power copier</a> tries to use standard telekinetic techniques with Alex's power, it doesn't work.

Later, Alex also learns to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">push away sound waves (yet another feat no normal telekinetic can match), which comes in handy, when he faces off against Will in a match, who uses a sonic device to disorient him</span>. The differences between Alex and Mary are highlighted during a team match in Year 2. Alex is weaker but has some tricks up his sleave and has a lot more finesse. Mary is a lot stronger, but she has to be really careful to avoid dealing lasting damage to someone and can't wield her power with as much precision as Alex. Mary's professor is an elderly woman, who has the same power set but infinitely more experience and training. She demonstrates an ability to manipulate dozens of objects simultaneously, something Mary wasn't even sure was possible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>: It turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Adam</span> is working with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Globe's group</span> and is only in the HCP to get close enough to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kill an unspecified person he holds responsible for the deaths of his family.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl">More Than Mind Control</a>: In <em>Year 4</em>, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Crispin's loyal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberTwo">Number Two</a> Sherman didn't used to be a true believer.

One of the reasons Chad moves into Melbrook is to show that, if Intra's son doesn't hold a grudge towards Globe's son, then their concerns are unfounded</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlapSlapKiss">Slap-Slap-Kiss</a>: During the river trip, Stella gets pissed off at Roy for saying that girls have no business being on a battlefield.

The classic example is a strongman, energy wielder, and advanced mind. An advanced mind can simply lift a strongman off the ground, an energy wielder can blast an advanced mind with impunity from range, while a strongman can simply shrug off blast attacks. Of course, all powers are different, and power advantages can be nullified with clever tactics. Because of this, most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLevel">Power Level</a> rankings tend to get quickly discarded, instead favoring a scale based on the amount of damage a Super can do if left unchecked.

In Year 1, Nick and Hershel play beer pong against a couple of Supers (with powers allowed), one of whom can teleport small objects and uses it to consistently score by teleporting the ball right above the cup. After Hershel changes into Roy, and Roy suggests switching to whiskey, the other kid quickly loses his focus and starts to miss. In the Labyrinth, Nick and Mary manage to defeat another teleporter by predicting his pattern. In Year 1, the Dean also brings a Powered teleporter to talk to the class, whose ability is entirely random as far as location and is only activated by him sneezing. Nick correctly guesses that he has learned to activate the ability on demand by forcing himself to sneeze with a feather (he still ends up anywhere in the world). Mr Transport reflects that, of all the teleporters he knows, no one has the same exact version of the power. He teleports without any special effects. Others teleport with visual, auditory, or other effects, such as a thunderclap, a bright flash, or a sulfuric smell. Gilbert is the class's resident teleporter, although it's stated to be short-range (i.e. only within visual distance).
