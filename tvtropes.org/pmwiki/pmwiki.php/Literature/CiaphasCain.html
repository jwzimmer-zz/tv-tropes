Cain has to lead a small squad into the planet's tunnels, finding something (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Necrons</span>) he is not exactly prepared for...</li><li> <em>The Traitor's Hand</em> takes place some years later, with the 597th deployed against a series of Chaos cults. With rebels and insurgents on every hand, Cain must figure out what the Ruinous Powers are planning, as well as deal with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> who happens to be the one sort of person he can't simply pull rank on: a fellow commissar...</li><li> <em>Death Or Glory</em> is essentially a prequel, detailing Cain's first rise to prominence during the Ork invasion of Perlia. Shot down behind enemy lines, he begins gathering up survivors into a makeshift convoy and traveling towards safety. Though he stumbles upon a number of fortuitous circumstances (such as what looks like a clandestine research lab under a dam), he really has only one goal in mind: saving his own skin...</li><li> <em>Duty Calls</em> picks up with Cain still in the 597th, but carries on from where <em>Death or Glory</em> left off; it forms the middle book of a trilogy. Called to handle a genestealer infestation and associated Tyranid hive fleet, Cain finds himself press-ganged by Amberley into helping her search for the people who ran that clandestine research lab. They have taken from it an artifact which could alter the very fate of the galaxy...</li><li> <em>Cain's Last Stand</em> takes place in the (at the time) "present day" of <em>Warhammer 40K</em> (meaning the closing of the 41st Millenium, as this was written before the Dark Millenium story event moved events forward into the 42nd Millenium)), after Cain has already retired to Perlia and is teaching at a military academy. Of course, one of the events of <em>WH40K</em>'s present day was the 13th Black Crusade, which catches the tiny planet up in its grasp. Abaddon knows about that universe-altering artifact, which has been returned to Perlia, and if Cain can't stop them from getting it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies</a>.</li><li> <em>The Emperor's Finest</em> details Cain's experiences serving with a chapter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a> (the Reclaimers) while clearing out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerelictGraveyard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DerelictGraveyard">Space Hulk</a>.

In it, Cain first joins the Valhallan 12th Field Artillery, a nice, safe assignment where he can hide away from anything more offensive than Jurgen's psoriasis. They successfully defeat an Ork infestation, but things go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldYourHippogriffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldYourHippogriffs">ploin-shaped</a> when there turns out to be a Tyranid splinter fleet right behind them...</li><li> "Echoes of the Tomb" concerns an event Cain alludes to often: his first experience in a Necron tomb. He's a field adjutant helping agents of the Mechanicus investigate ancient ruins. Guess how it turns out.</li><li> "The Beguiling" takes place on the planet of Slawkenberg, where Cain runs into a priestess in service of the god Slaanesh. This priestess, Emeli, almost succeeds in seducing him, but Jurgen is able to intercede, and the story ends with the two of them fleeing and calling an artillery strike on their location.</li><li> "Sector Thirteen" involves Cain investigating a brothel where several of his men got into trouble. What he discovers is that it's actually the center of a genestealer infestation. He and Jurgen now have two priorities: wipe out the genestealer cult<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fdul');"><sup>*&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0fdul" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fdul');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Because why steal genes when people will actually pay you to take them?

He and Jurgen must find a way to stop the enemy from using it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideAttack">Suicide Attacker</a> on the Imperial fleet &mdash; while somehow avoiding death themselves.</li><li> "A Mug of Recaff": Trooper Jurgen has watched the heroic Commissar Cain defeat a heretical uprising and wants only to get him a nice mug of recaff. But the heretics aren't quite finished just yet...</li><li> "The Smallest Detail": Jurgen is on a scrounging mission when he accidentally uncovers a black market racketeering operation.</li><li> "Old Soldiers Never Die": A limited release novella (Which has since been republished as an eBook).

The short stories are in equally random order, with two taking place before book four (Including Cain's first act of alleged heroism), one taking place somewhere between books four and seven, one taking place immediately before book seven, and one taking place roughly a decade before book six, and several that have so few reference points that one cannot reliably tell what decade they took place in.

Amberley states that the hulk in question is only 4 or 5 kilometers across in any direction, which she describes as "quite big enough", being so big that an entire fleet anticipates taking months to destroy it. The problem is that in this setting an escort ship is from .8 to 1.5 kilometers long, and a standard cruiser is more than 5 kilometers in length (though this varies by game edition and writer). The hulk is referred to as containing <em>battleships</em>, any one of which would be twice the size as that given for the entire object. The distances and travel times when he explores it indicate an object at least ten times the given size, so this may just be a typo.</li><li> In <em>The Greater Good</em>, Cain gives a number of details about the ship he was traveling on, each of which implies that Cain was on a totally different class of warship.

Through most of the series, he appears totally selfish, but if something needs to be done, then it needs to be done. A specific example is when he jumps to save Amberley in Pererimunda and later reasons that he only did it because the pilot wouldn't have left without her, but one can see that he jumped first and rationalized later. This not only happens with Amberley, but also on other occasions, such as the time he sets the explosives in Nusquam Fundumentibus. He's pretty much sacrificing his own life to take out the tyranid infestation, but he survives thanks to some fast reasoning and Jurgen's proper use of a snowmobile to escape through tunnels previously dug by their enemies.</li><li> As noted above, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

Neither side wants it to break out (yet), leading to a lot of this. Early on, a Kroot mercenary saves Cain from being beaten to death by Tau sympathisers.

It is implied that he couldn't have defended himself from an actual investigation and is lucky that his memory has never been scanned before. But then again, Amberley is the first human being in his life whom he cannot fool no matter how he tried, and she's an Inquisitor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtMartialed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CourtMartialed">Court-Martialed</a>:<ul><li> In <em>For the Emperor</em> Cain presides over the trials of six Guardsmen from the Valhallan 296th and 301st who had been involved in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarBrawl">Bar Brawl</a> that resulted in the deaths of several Guardsmen and Imperial Navy personnel.

He then deals with the root of the problem by re-founding the two amalgamated half-strength regiments as one unit, the Valhallan 597th.</li><li> <em>The Traitor's Hand</em> wraps up with Cain facing a Commissariat tribunal, basically a court-martial by a different name.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoversAlwaysLie">Covers Always Lie</a>: Boy, do they; the cover artist deliberately presents Cain in the overblown style of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemptibleCover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContemptibleCover">propaganda posters</a> the character so often ends up on. Thus, the laspistol-wielding, cover-seeking Cain is depicted boldly leading his men, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual-wielding</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">bolt pistols</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtopAMountainOfCorpses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtopAMountainOfCorpses">while he stands on a pile of enemy dead</a>. Also, none of the covers include the red sash Commissars wear as part of their uniform, and which is a minor plot point in <em>Cain's Last Stand</em>. Cain is also depicted as being hugely muscled, although given his daily chainsword practice regimen and feats with the weapon in-story that's not much of a stretch.<ul><li> Hypotheses aside, one of the few things we do know for sure about Cain's physical appearance is his imposing height&mdash;Amberley in one book clearly states that Cain was just under two meters tall and invariably among the tallest in any group of people.</li><li> <em>The Greater Good</em> is a particularly strong example of this trope. The name and cover art imply that the Tau feature heavily. However, the conflict with the Tau is resolved amicably in the first few chapters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">due to the oncoming Tyranid threat</a>. Then the Tau and the Imperium retreat their forces to fortify their respective worlds, and the Tau remain in the background for the rest of the novel.

So while there is the risk of dying horribly at the hands of an invader, it's unlikely.<ul><li> Which makes sense when you realized that the events form the codexes (the main source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark">Grim Dark</a>) are only the major ones and are often centuries apart.</li><li> It's also explicitly justified several times. Most of the places Cain visits are such backwaters that the Imperial government in the sector mostly just ignores them, allowing the locals to carry on. The world in the first book, for instance, had been openly trading with the Tau for generations before anyone noticed. The one major world we see, the forge world in <em>The Greater Good</em>, is the setting's usual hellish hive full of slave labor and casual dismissal of human lives.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> Jurgen always seems to have whatever is needed in those pouches of his.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingHandshake">Crushing Handshake</a>: Cain's augmetic fingers have given him the upper hand (ha ha) at least once in regards to this trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Cult</a>: There's the usual mess of Chaos cultists. Also, Vail reports a cult that worships Cain as the embodied will of the Emperor and quotes the <em>Book of Cain</em>.

In particular, Cain occasionally sees Jurgen looking at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PornStash">porno slate</a>, and according to Amberley, the entire "Cain Archive" was him putting all his adventures onto a single dataslate.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDodging">Deadly Dodging</a>: Cain making combat servitors fire at each other in <em>Cain's Last Stand</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>:<ul><li> Cain, in his comments on other characters.</li><li> Amberley frequently does this in her footnotes and in her comments about some of the non-Cain texts she inserts pages from.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedFallGuyGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedFallGuyGambit">Deceased Fall-Guy Gambit</a>: Cain defuses an argument between the Ordo Xenos and the Adeptus Mechanicus over which side caused the security leak that allowed Chaos agents to learn of the Shadowlight by blaming it on the long-dead rogue Inquisitor Killian. While he claims this was just so he could stop the argument and get people working on solving the problem, the logic he uses in naming his scapegoat is fairly plausible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecliningPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecliningPromotion">Declining Promotion</a>: Ciaphas Cain is a downplayed example. It's mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootnoteFever">a footnote</a> in <em>The Greater Good</em> that he would more than qualify as a "Lord Commissar" (which is technically a title connoting respect, since the Commissariat is made up of equals) but refuses to be called such. Downplayed because he still gets the respect and influence either way; he just does it as part of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumbleHero">Humble Hero</a> persona.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>: The xenophobia and authoritarianism of the Imperium are on full display, though Sandy Mitchell tends to use it for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> instead of plain grimdark.<ul><li> Now and again, especially when Cain is up against the Tau. Apparently, egalitarianism and open-mindedness freak him out, as you would expect from an Imperial citizen.<ul><li> From the same book, he also seems approving when the Arbites show up to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">beat the crap out of</a> a handful of troublesome but otherwise peaceful pro-Tau humans.</li><li> While subtle, there are a few casual lines thrown in that shows Cain has the typical xenophobic view of the Tau expected from most Imperials. Relatively speaking, he is still very tolerant of them, which can largely be attributed to professional respect and the overall lack of instances where the Tau have actively tried to kill him. Granted, as a well connected Commissar, he might also be privy to the knowledge that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Greater Good is not nice</a>, which could also influence his views of them.</li></ul></li><li> Another example in <em>Cain's Last Stand</em>: glancing around the Schola grounds, Cain notes a black-painted truck bearing a load of prisoners for interrogation, execution and <em>live-fire exercises</em>, decides all is well and gets back to work. There's also the line about looking forward to a brisk round of target practice against unarmed demonstrators, but that one was probably a joke.</li><li> He mentions organizing firing squads very casually as part of his duties in one of the short stories.</li><li> Cain also appears to believe wholeheartedly in machine spirits and the rituals of the Mechanicus, although he doesn't care much for individual techpriests most of the time. (Given the two Necron tombs they hacked off while he was around <em>that we know of</em>, it's hard to blame him.) Finding a stolen Imperial-made gun mounted on an orkish buggy, he wonders if it will still work now that its spirit "has been corrupted by being forced into servitude". When it does, he reckons it's because it remains loyal to the Emperor. In the same book he makes a big deal about the courage and self-sacrifice of an escape pod's auto-pilot computer.<ul><li> He's quite put off by the secular way the Tau and their loyalists use their machinery, and wonders why the machine-spirits of the Tau don't simply stop working "out of sheer pique."</li><li> In <em>Cain's Last Stand</em>, he sees that the Chaos forces are using Imperial wargear with Chaos runes daubed over the aquilae. He immediately decides that it will be too dangerous to ever put those weapons back into Imperial hands because they've effectively converted to Chaos, and orders them destroyed.</li></ul></li><li> Amberley Vail usually comes across as a fairly reasonable, likeable person. And then she mentions, in <em>Caves of Ice</em>, how she can never hold back a smile when looking at the amusing expressions on the faces of heretics being burned alive in a book from her childhood. She also seems quite pleased (enough to unsettle Cain) in <em>For The Emperor</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Tau seem unaware that their wounded troopers they've just rescued are probably infected by Genestealers, and shows no inclination to warn them</span>.</li><li> In <em>The Greater Good</em>, when the Mechanicus finally comes clean about their Genestealer breeding/research program, one character at the conference points out that all the original implantees were male. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Female prisoners scheduled for conversion to servitors were turned over to the implanted men so more hybrids could be produced, it's implied via rape.</span> Though uncomfortable at the measures taken to study the Genestealers none of the Imperials at the table have any real problem with this <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although a visiting Tau diplomat is clearly appalled</span>.</li><li> Then there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">nursery rhyme, "The tracks on the Land Raider crush the heretics, crush the heretics, crush the heretics..."</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonOfHumanOrigin">Demon of Human Origin</a>: In the short story "The Beguiling", Cain wipes out a Slaaneshi cult with an artillery strike after killing its leader, Emeli, when she tried to seduce him into being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>.

Another example from Perlia involves the new governor heroically defending her hunting cabin from an attack, ignoring the squad of stormtroopers that were assigned to guard her and did all the fighting. And of course, Jurgen is rarely mentioned in any of the official histories of Cain's exploits, and then only in passing; outside of the Cain Archive there are no records detailing the significance of Jurgen's contributions (Amberley notes that, with the best will in the world, Jurgen isn't the sort of person you want to include in a heroic legend).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a>: The fresh-out-of-the-schola Commissar Forres seems more concerned with driving troops to show their valor and be willing to sacrifice themselves for the Emperor than actual efficient strategy.

Then Cain defeats the daemon (Beije getting attacked in the process), earning the admiration and respect of the Emperor-botherers Beije had brought with him, undermining his authority further. Then, once Cain is put on trial, the jury not only clears Cain of all charges, but starts looking into charges of incompetence for Beije. And when they're out of the courtroom, Cain reminds Beije that they still have a duel to fight (Beije having referred to Kasteen as a "petticoat colonel"), so Beije is forced to hastily apologize to her.

Cain senses that Drumon is just humoring him after easily deflecting a few of his strikes, so Cain starts downplaying his own abilities, and intentionally fighting poorly. He then steps up his game suddenly, bypassing Drumon's defenses and taking a chip out of his armor with the teeth of his chainsword.

The man ends up interfering in operations several times as a result, nearly dooming the world they're defending in the process, and ends up bringing Cain before a tribunal on formal charges. Said tribunal calls said commissar an idiot and Cain himself has to call in favors to save the man from the fallout.</li><li> It's also often mentioned (and shown) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Sentinel</a> pilots have a pretty <em>laissez faire</em> approach to discipline and orders, disobeying the letter of their superiors' messages if they think they have a better idea and speaking rather more informally than is considered proper on official channels.

Of course, it's his job to shoot anyone rude enough to point this out.<ul><li> Also, he's told that the Imperium are desperately keen to avoid having to defend Gravalax from outright invasion by the tau, as it would be a drawn-out war of attrition for a largely insignificant backwater, and a drain on resources needed to fight the tyranids and necrons, in contrast to the rhetoric that the Emperor's mighty forces will defend his territory anywhere in the galaxy.</li><li> The broader background behind <em>The Greater Good</em> is that the Imperium and the Tau have realized they need to work together to defeat the Tyranid hive fleets, but at the same time each is trying to arrange things so that the other power shoulders the brunt of the effort so that they themselves can more easily sweep up whatever's left in the aftermath.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignmentBackfire">Reassignment Backfire</a>:<ul><li> Inverted repeatedly throughout the books, as Cain tries to get <em>himself</em> assigned to a nice, quiet job where he doesn't have to be shot at all the time, but always winds up in the worst possible situations&mdash;which gets him a reputation for being a thrill-seeker, causing him to end up in even <em>more</em> of these!

The Valhallan 597th are around 1000 troopers total, which is not so bad except that if that is the standard, would mean that Cain has defended planets of billions with a force around 5,000 people at the highest. During the events of the fourth novel, for example, he mentions that a few regiments were liberating the entire star system, so perhaps 10,000 soldiers. For comparison, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Grande Armee</a> was around <strong>800 000</strong> soldiers. In later books, the 597th has about 4,000 soldiers, so it's not so bad, but it's still bad. The American military in World War 2 had ten thousand-man regiments, and that was when it had only a thirtieth of the planet's population of 2.5 billion.

While he admits (privately of course) his primary motivation is to save his own skin, Cain does correctly point out that the Necrons in the tomb likely outnumber the Imperials hundreds to one, and if they do wake up, the Imperials will find themselves caught between the Necrons and the Orks already invading the planet, so the best thing to do in the circumstances is get off planet, alert the Inquisition to what they've found and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheOnlyWayToBeSure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheOnlyWayToBeSure">call in an Imperial Navy flotilla to obliterate the tomb from orbit</a>.

Thing is, Tyranids can't enter the Warp <em>at all</em> (and thank the Emperor for that, otherwise they'd have already eaten the galaxy instead of moving at sub-light speed. However, an entry in the Tyranid Codex <em>does</em> speculate that some Tyranid fleets have entered the warp through things like the Eye of Terror or the Storm of the Emperor's Wrath, which would explain the appearance of Tyranids during the Great Crusade (10k years before the attack of Hive Fleet Behemoth). Still, they don't have conventional warp travel).<ul><li> Though Tyranids do have a bio-ship (the <a class="urllink" href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Narvhal#.U7S2cXxOVdg">Narvhal<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>) that can create a kind of corridor of folded gravity, allowing Hive Fleets to move at FTL speed (though it's still much slower than Warp travel).

The series purports to be a set of memoirs, written by the titular Ciaphas Cain about a century after they happened. Ciaphas himself is very much an egomaniac and focuses almost exclusively on his own actions, but is also either an <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

The first is the memoirs of Jenit Sulla, who was one of Cain's subordinates during the events he describes. However, Jenit has entirely bought into the heroic myth surrounding Cain (which was one of the things Cain set out to dispel), writes in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse">prose so purple it's nigh unreadable</a> and her narration makes it sound like Cain was a mentor-figure to her (Cain's narration makes it clear he considers her nothing more than another snot-nosed butterbar and finds her eager "Emperor-and-Imperium"-idealism extremely annoying).</li><li> The second is a history of the sector in which Cain operated during the events in <em>For the Emperor!</em>, which gets a lot of the facts right and provides a very good overview of the area and events surrounding the plot, but the author is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> who blames everything from toenail fungus to Exterminatus on a (quite likely non-existent) conspiracy of rogue traders.</li><li> The third is Cain's official biography, which the man himself treats with an attitude varying from "confusion" to "amusement" to "would rather wipe my arse with a rusty poker than that rag", depending on which side of the bed he woke up on.</li><li> Finally, the editor, Inquisitor Amberley Vail, was involved in the events and a frequent collaborator (as well as sometime lover) of Cain's, and, while she is generally impartial, she is not above a little judicious editing and inserting a few footnotes implying Cain's memory of certain events is flawed to make herself look better.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">Unresolved Sexual Tension</a>: Subverted. While it's never said outright, statements peppered throughout the books, both in the text and in Vail's footnotes, all but confirm that the sexual tension between Cain and Vail is very much resolved. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is outright confirmed in the short story <em>The Little Things</em>, in which Cain arrives at Vail's hotel suite for a romantic rendezvous, only for unwelcome guests (read, incompetent hitmen) to make an appearance.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedFalseFaith">Unwanted False Faith</a>: Cain never found out, but one of the Tallarn witnesses to a battle where he beat down a Greater Daemon wrote a book about the experience and started a minor branch of the Imperial faith that worships him as a physical manifestation of the Emperor's will.

Cain hated it for a number of reasons, not least for totally ignoring Jurgen's involvement (as is always the case when people write about his adventures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact">Villains Act, Heroes React</a>: Cain is generally sent on missions to repel invasions or suppress rebellions, as opposed to conquering new worlds.

According to one of Amberley's footnotes in <em>Cain's Last Stand</em>, the Adeptas Sororitas are <em>not</em> actually required to be celibate, but most Sisters don't have many opportunities to take advantage so this trope is a common myth about the service. The footnote in question comments on Cain discovering that Sister Julien, one of his fellow instructors at the schola progenium, is in a relationship with the bursar.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWayOutOfACaveIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWayOutOfACaveIn">A Way Out of a Cave-In</a>: In <em>Caves of Ice</em>, an ambull is found wandering around the titular caves under a mining facility besieged by orks.
