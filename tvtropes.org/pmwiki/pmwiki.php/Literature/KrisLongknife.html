When Kris encounters their colony on Xanadu there's apparently been a religious dispute: the good aliens are now referred to as angels. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Abdicators try to frame her for their assassination of Henry Peterwald and start an apocalyptic war so that spacers stop visiting them and the evil aliens won't find them.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">Armchair Military</a>: The first book comes at the end of an eighty-year peace and most of the senior officers in the series have never seen major combat.

However, plot points in a couple of the later books are made of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">technobabble</a> beam that can knock chunks off a neutron star, which are first captured and used as part of the warhead of Hellburner torpedoes, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">then used as kinetic bullets by Kris in the climactic battle of <em>Unrelenting</em></span>. In reality this would not work: the neutron-degenerate matter that makes up neutron stars (popularly known as "neutronium") only stays that way under the intense gravity of a neutron star.

Two or three books in it starts to verge on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: Kris actually starts to get rather blase about constantly being shot at or bombed, and in <em>Undaunted</em> she finds herself annoyed that she <em>wasn't</em> the target of the latest round.</li><li> Vicky hasn't suffered quite as many, yet, though she's rapidly catching up after her stepmother puts out a hit on her.

All of Kris's surviving great-grandparents are military veterans of wars with the Iteeche and various human factions and have survived almost as many assassination attempts as she herself has. Her father and brother, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy">Non-Action Guys</a>, are very effective politicians who still display <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel">Nerves of Steel</a> when the balloon goes up. About the only member who doesn't qualify is her paternal grandfather Al Longknife, a hyper-rich and <em>extremely</em> paranoid business executive who rarely leaves his heavily fortified skyscraper (he seems to have turned his badassery gene into finding ways to further enrich himself).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a>: Several different people conclude that the absurdly oversexualized female Greenfeld court fashions encouraged by the Empress are likely meant to entice her husband to sleep around and cheat on her so he ends up dead at the hands of an cuckolded husband or lover.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleCouple">Battle Couple</a>:<ul><li> Tom and Penny, who are both Navy officers and lovers, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he's killed in action in <em>Defiant</em> three days after their wedding</span>.</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kris and Jack starting in <em>Furious</em> after their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> at the end of the previous book.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleInTheRain">Battle in the Rain</a>:<ul><li> The Battle of Black Mountain in <em>To Do Or Die</em> takes place in the middle of a torrential downpour at night. It's deliberate, so as to eliminate the defenders tech advantages (the position was EMPed beforehand).

Unfortunately, the first few ships off the line have some problems: several Earth ships randomly explode under heavy fire, which Kris's people trace to micron-size irregularities in the length of the crystals causing the heat to spread unevenly (this is solved by improving quality control). In "Kris Longknife's Bad Day", some genius at Wardhaven Main Navy suggests adding a double layer, which Kris suspects will just make it harder to cool off the armor.</li><li> In <em>Kris Longknife's Relief</em>, Sandy Santiago encounters alien ships that have had additional cooling fins added so they can better perform high-<em>g</em> burns and extended laser barrages.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a>: Jack is transferred to the Wardhaven Marines to allow him to protect Kris when deployed, and she ends up commanding several companies of them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceNavy">Space Navy</a>: What Kris joins, much to the dismay of her parents: her mother considers it unladylike and her father wanted to use her as a campaigner, having groomed her older brother Honovi to be a politician like himself.

In <em>Redoubtable</em>, Kris discovers a ship's exhaust trail leading to an unexplored jump point. After a buoy sent through the jump doesn't come back, <em>Wasp</em>'s scientists invent a sort of telescope to look through a jump point, and realize that the star on the other side has become a nova.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>:<ul><li> Emperor Henry I is so wrapped around the little finger of his new wife he's apparently oblivious to the fact that she's trying to kill his daughter (which everyone else in the Empire knows), that she and her family are rotting his empire into destruction (which people in the Empire are finding out), and that she's probably setting him up to be killed by a jealous husband or lover (which a great many observers have concluded is happening).</li><li> Kris happens upon a Nuclear Age species in <em>Tenacious</em>, the Sasquans, and Solzen, the president-for-life of the nastiest of the three major national blocs, fires nuclear missiles at her squadron of frigates when they come into orbit.
