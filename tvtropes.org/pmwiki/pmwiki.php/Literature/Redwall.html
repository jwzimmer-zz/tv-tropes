Yet they also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes">retain some of their animal natures</a>, which usually manifest as specific skills: such as moles being expert workmen, especially at digging, and otters being skilled swimmers and shrimp fishermen.</p><p>The series centers on Redwall Abbey, a commune devoted to peace, though many who live there are quite capable of defending themselves if attacked. The books take place across a vast time period that may span centuries (it's difficult to tell since the characters measure time in ill-defined "seasons"). Most are complete stand-alone stories, so they can mostly be read in any order. In fact, for a while, Jacques wrote the stories wildly out of chronological order, though in his final years, he set each book further ahead in time than the last one. Only four books (<em>Redwall</em> and <em>Mattimeo</em>, <em>Mariel of Redwall</em> and <em>The Bellmaker</em>) act as direct sequels featuring most of the same characters. Most others do share a few characters, albeit many seasons apart.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Typical stories consist of some villainous horde laying siege to the abbey, while/or some of its inhabitants have to venture somewhere else. Either way, several exciting medieval-style battles ensue until the book's villains are defeated. Despite the lack of an ongoing story, continuity lovers will find much to admire in the consistency of the world surrounding Redwall; each book's inside cover features a map of the territory the story covers, and they all fit together very well (although things may change slightly over the years). Other societies, like the badger lords and hare soldiers of the mountain fortress Salamandastron, or the wandering Guosim shrews, pop up frequently and have a real sense of history to them. As well, some of the most exciting times for fans came with the publications of the books <em>Martin the Warrior</em> and <em>Lord Brocktree</em>, as the eponymous characters are mentioned numerous times in other books as legendary warriors from the past, meaning that with the titles alone Jacques was announcing that we would finally be seeing the real story behind those legends.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><span class="asscaps">The books, by order of publication, are:</span></p><ol><li> <em>Redwall</em> (1986)</li><li> <em>Mossflower</em> (1988)</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mattimeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mattimeo">Mattimeo</a></em> (1989)</li><li> <em>Mariel of Redwall</em> (1991)</li><li> <em>Salamandastron</em> (1992)</li><li> <em>Martin the Warrior</em> (1993)</li><li> <em>The Bellmaker</em> (1994)</li><li> <em>Outcast of Redwall</em> (1995)</li><li> <em>The Pearls of Lutra</em> (1996)</li><li> <em>The Long Patrol</em> (1997)</li><li> <em>Marlfox</em> (1998)</li><li> <em>The Legend of Luke</em> (1999)</li><li> <em>Lord Brocktree</em> (2000)</li><li> <em>The Taggerung</em> (2001)</li><li> <em>Triss</em> (2002)</li><li> <em>Loamhedge</em> (2003)</li><li> <em>Rakkety Tam</em> (2004)</li><li> <em>High Rhulain</em> (2005)</li><li> <em>Eulalia!</em> (2007)</li><li> <em>Doomwyte</em> (2008)</li><li> <em>The Sable Quean</em> (2010)</li><li> <em>The Rogue Crew</em> (2011)</li></ol><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Jacques died of a heart attack</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-12380763">on 5 February 2011,<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> leaving his 22nd novel, <em>The Rogue Crew</em>, finished but unpublished; the book was later released on May 3rd, 2011.</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> was made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nelvana">Nelvana</a> and featured three seasons - the first based on the original book, the second on <em>Mattimeo</em> and the third on <em>Martin the Warrior</em>.

He also kills a Sister when she tries to stop him, though he's killed later on and the sword is stolen by an actual vermin, who manages to get to the end of the book before dying.<ul><li> Voles in general are perhaps the closest thing the series has to a "neutral" species&mdash;they aren't evil the way vermin are, but there are multiple times where they are depicted as selfish opportunists who cannot be trusted and are willing to screw over fellow woodlanders. Druwp from Martin the Warrior is another example.

None of them face any real consequences for their actions, however.</li><li> In short, by the end of almost two dozens of books, there are exactly three woodlander species that never had one of their members portrayed downright negatively: mice, otters and badgers.

Despite the titular Redwall being an abbey, having an abbot/abbess and various characters referred to as Brother/Sister, there is no real religion to speak of (no one is referred to as a monk/nun, prayer is a generic grace at mealtimes). The only form of supernatural is the spirit of Martin the Warrior, who appears once a book to aid the protagonists, and Dark Forest, which some characters see when near death, and the ghosts of their ancestors. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Even the first book</a>, which featured a church of Saint Ninian, had no one to pray to (although the villain does have a nightmare of the Devil, who got referenced as well). There are often references to the afterlife though, such as "Dark Forest" (a neutral land of eternal slumber) and "Hellgates". Curiously, bad guys are referred to as going to either when they die. Sunflash even briefly witnesses the Dark Forest in <em>Outcast of Redwall</em>, though he is barred from entering until his quest is complete. In <em>The Taggerung</em> Vulpuz is mentioned, who's said to be the lord of Hellgates and the foxes' supposed creator (his name is close to Latin "vulpus" for "fox"). He seems to be a deity, though there's no sign of foxes or anyone having an organized religion based on him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes">Animal Stereotypes</a>:<ul><li> Weirdly, it's averted with the owls; they're almost invariably goodnatured but absent-minded, and almost never "wise", as folklore would have it.

To be fair both are <em>sort of</em> true. There <em>was</em> a battle between Swartt's force and the Abbey dwellers (that lasted a few pages and was never anywhere near the Abbey) and Veil did have a moment of conflict when Bryony showed up at the cave Swartt was hiding in (and it's left unclear what he decided, if anything). Covers also repeatedly show Swartt with his sixclaw on the wrong side.</li><li> By far most blatant ones were made by a German cover artist. The <a class="urllink" href="http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20060105021050/redwall/images/2/27/GermanRedwall.jpg">Redwall<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small> one, for instance shows all animals nude.

It shows nude Martin and his cronies <em>riding</em> the Salamandastron hares like on horses (apart from the fact that there are only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">two</a> hares present). And... wait a minute... who is that third mouse?! What do you mean, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotWeasel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotWeasel">supposed to be a shrew</a>?! And why are the other two mice <em>blue?</em> Artist, are you blind? Or illiterate? Or high? Or everything at the same time? Anyway, it apparently took the publishers three of such covers, before they finally fired that cover artist.

Redwall itself is a Catholic-like abbey with monks and nuns, and aside from this however there's no explicit religion, with only a vague "Dark Forest" as the afterlife. The Devil is mentioned in the first book, but religious references are made progressively less frequent.

In real world Medieval England (similar to the world of the books) this would have been perfectly acceptable. Cider, beer and wine were drunk by young children, girls as young as 13 were often married to older men and army drummer boys or navy powder monkeys might be as young as 10.

The omission is pretty odd considering that Redwall is an abbey, with monks and an abbot. They only say a generic grace at meals, with no mention of prayers. In the other books however it gets downplayed even more, with only the "Lord of Dark Forest" (the afterlife) also has been occasionally mentioned. However he also appears to be more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Grim Reaper</a> figure than Satan. In <em>The Taggerung</em> Vulpuz, a being with similarity to the Devil, is also mentioned. There is also the fact that in the original "Redwall" book, the giant adder is named Asmodeus, which one in-universe character identifies as "the name of the devil himself".

Also, one of the characters was a beaver. In later books, author Brian Jacques made it clear that only animals existed in the Redwall universe, and only animals native to the British Isles, so there were no future appearances of any more beavers (though beavers WERE native to Britain at one time, but they were killed off due to overhunting). And when animals that aren't native to Britain do appear, like the golden hamster in one book, they speak with foreign accents to indicate that they aren't from Mossflower.</li><li> The animal characters also gradually became more human-like, especially badger characters. In the first book, specific note is always made when Constance rears up on her back feet; in later books, even badgers are assumed to be bipedal.</li><li> The order of Redwall itself started out as reminiscent of a Catholic monastic order: the members wore habits, they lived somewhat sequestered inside their Abbey, and remained celibate for the entirety of their lives. Cornflower got yelled at for flirting with Matthias, who was then a novice of the order and therefore off-limits; when they got married, Matthias was mentioned to have left the order and lived apart from the monks. In later books, all that's left of this rule is that there is an Abbey. Even Abbesses and Abbots can be married, and not even the habit is required anymore, morphing it into some sort of peaceful commune that's little different from other communities in the forest.</li><li> The first book <em>Redwall</em> had more religious/mystical references, including mentions of heaven and hell and a snake named Asmodeus, after a demon in the Catholic/Orthodox Bible. Again, these are toned down in establishing Redwall as its own universe. In the first book, it is also ambivalent whether Sela the fox actually had unique powers. Later in the series, any claims of supernatural powers are usually explicitly presented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">"Scooby-Doo" Hoax</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicDreamsForEveryone">Psychic Dreams for Everyone</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers">seers</a> remained, however).</li><li> In an early scene in the first book, claims that Cluny's horde is all evil is met with cries of "That's right, give a rat a bad name!" implying that there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">rats</a> living in Redwall.
