However, this takes place several weeks after the attack on Calth, which Kor Phaeron fled from before the mass counter-attack could begin. <em>Macragge's Honour</em> shows that Kor Phaeron was stranded on Sicarus within the Eye of Terror (far, far away from any Ultramarine counterattack) after his ship was destroyed by the eponymous battleship shortly after fleeing Calth.

Moreover, it is revealed that that the warp has an everchanging network of currents subjected to tides, storms and so on like a very complicated ocean, with also layers of currents that become more dangerous the further into the warp they go but also are faster to navigate through.

They also maintain friendly relations with the Eldar, who taught them about Chaos. One Interex character, when questioned about this, proclaims that they had no right to annihilate another species just because it was different. Furthermore, they are well aware of the dangers of Chaos and regard it rationally and openly as a threat that must be opposed by all sentient beings.

The reason why the Space Wolves fight the Thousand Sons was because Horus (already worshiping Chaos, but still "loyal" to the Emperor) tells Russ that the orders changed from apprehend to kill.</span></li><li> The Emperor's plan for dealing with Chaos is to lie to and woefully underinform all of his sons, and his entire population, about what Chaos <em>is</em> (telling Horus, for example, that chaos "demons" are just random collections of emotions that have no real intelligence or guiding force), apparently forgetting that one of the major powers of Chaos is to literally plays chess with mortals. Didn't he think even <em>once</em> that the Chaos Gods would try to tempt the Primarchs?

Custodians and Sisters of Silence still have to constantly fight the daemons that get through.

A lot of the traitor Legions (and more than a few loyalists) raise concerns about what would happen when the Great Crusade is over or when they are no longer needed. This then sublimates into a resentment towards the people who are inhabiting the world that they helped to create. However, it's unknown what the Emperor intended to do with the Astartes after they were no longer needed.<ul><li> Directly averted by Legions like the Ultramarines.

It allows the depiction of all the aspects of war, from epic battles between Space Marines, their support staff, and civilian refugees having to flee said epic battles. This allows for some dark irony too as for instance in <em>The Lost and Damned</em> a battle is shown from the point of view of a conscript, where he and his company fight tooth and nail to repel a horde of mutants and almost dies in the process.
