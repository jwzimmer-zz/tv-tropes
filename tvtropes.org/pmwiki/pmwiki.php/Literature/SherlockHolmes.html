Straker has been killed by a blow to the skull, assumed to have been administered by prime suspect Fitzroy Simpson with his "Penang lawyer", a clublike walking stick. However, Holmes is able to demonstrate that Straker had been attempting to lame Silver Blaze in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixingTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixingTheGame">fix a horse race</a> when the horse kicked him in the head.</li><li> In "The Adventure of the Lion's Mane", Fitzroy died with his back covered with dark red lines as though he had been terribly flogged.

He has a knowledge of crime that would put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> to shame, and yet is unaware that the earth revolves around the sun, believes that the human memory can only hold a certain amount of information until it's full (though it seems that he later rejects this belief), suffers from "periods of lethargy", and is a casual cocaine user.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAssassin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalAssassin">Animal Assassin</a>: In "The Adventure of the Speckled Band", the villain murdered his victim by letting a venomous snake into her bedroom while she slept.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>:<ul><li> Lestrade is often described as having bulldog or weasel-like features, usually depending on whether he thinks he's beaten Holmes to the punch.</li><li> Holmes himself is often compared to a hunting hound when he's hard on the trail of a criminal.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia">Arcadia</a>: Deconstructed in "The Copper Beeches". On a trip into the countryside, Watson comments on the beauty of the country farmhouses, to which Holmes responds by pointing out that isolation enables criminals and abusers to get away with it much more easily than they could in the crowded city.<div class="indent">"...But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law.

The rest of the stories provide plenty more examples. This shows up in "The Boscombe Valley Mystery", "The Cardboard Box", "The Crooked Man", "The Resident Patient", "The Abbey Grange" and "The Devil's Foot".

Charles McCarthy was actually the victim of an Australian stagecoach robbery, and then decades later the victim of murder, both by the same man. In the intervening time, however, he'd been blackmailing his eventual murderer to such a degree and with such cruelty that this trope easily applies.</li><li> Subverted/Exaggerated in "The Norwood Builder".

While not quite as bad as the others listed here, he is clearly something of a selfish dick, and it's eventually revealed that Irene Adler has kept the compromising photograph not for blackmail purposes but merely to protect herself from the King's wrath should it become necessary.

Subverted in that, while Mycroft is physically lazy, he's actually an extremely hard-working civil servant whose encyclopedic knowledge frequently decides British national policy. Mycroft could easily have been a detective himself, but as he explains in "The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans" he loathes the idea of doing the legwork needed to actually gather the facts he'd need to make his deductions.<ul><li> Some qualification: Mycroft is better at observation and reasoning, but <em>stinks</em> as a detective. His manner of handling the Greek Interpreter case tips off the bad guys big time, who then come back and try to torture the client to death. The point of the story seemed to be that figuring out someone's profession by their left pinky is a cute trick, but it does <em>not</em> a detective make.</li><li> This might also tie in Sherlock's refusal to learn anything he deems unimportant to his work, like the Earth turning around the Sun or cultural history not related to crime. Meanwhile Mycroft needs to exactly know these little things for his line of work.</li><li> Sherlock himself may sometimes qualify as this, although his "periods of lethargy" as described by Watson often come closer to full-on manic depression than simple laziness.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">Bunny-Ears Lawyer</a>: Holmes is a fairly messed up genius and in early stories was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> in an odd way - knowing minute details about criminal history and the topics of his monographs but barely knowing how to read a map and uninformed about a variety of other topics. He actually has a logical (even if said logic does hail from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">moon</a>) explanation for this - he considers the mind to be like an attic, possessed of a limited amount of space and therefore useless if you throw just any old shit in there. So interesting-but-functionally-useless facts like "the Earth revolves around the sun" have no place in the mind of a consulting detective, but some of the more eclectic applications of chemistry with little practical day-to-day use may well occupy the forefront of his mind for weeks at a time if he thinks it'll solve a case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusCrash">Bus Crash</a>: Mary Watson's death is only hinted at, by Watson's oblique reference in "The Empty House" to "my own sad bereavement", and Holmes' advice that "Work is the best antidote to sorrow, my dear Watson," although it's fairly clear that she must be in some way absent given that Watson moves back in with Holmes in the next story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusmansHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BusmansHoliday">Busman's Holiday</a>: In both "The Adventure of the Reigate Squire" and "The Adventure of the Devil's Foot," Holmes takes a country holiday with express orders to relax, then ends up solving crimes anyway.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAgriculture">Call to Agriculture</a>: Holmes retires to keep bees on the Sussex Downs.

Only on one occasion, when dealing with one really nasty scoundrel, does he take out a riding crop and threaten to give him a good 'thrashing 'around the ears. On the other hand, Watson, who only breaks society's rules in extreme scenarios (which, living with Holmes, has made them not that rare) will just grab a chair or a fire poker and threaten, with complete intent to use it on his opponent.<ul><li> Milverton would also qualify, as he carries a gun around to every negotiation to avoid any physical confrontation.</li><li> Moriarty is the king of unfairness. He doesn't do anything himself, instead dispatching an army of professional killers to pick off his victims in the most sudden, unexpected, and brutal ways. Typically they don't even see it coming. Until, of course, in the final scenes of "The Final Problem" when he's lost everything.

The murder itself, however, was a pure coincidence that had nothing to do with the stolen papers</span>.</li><li> Another incident that turned out to be not contrived at all occurs in "Silver Blaze". The stable boy failed to guard the stolen horse because his dinner had been drugged. But the drug used wasn't tasteless. Rather a far coincidence that a man from out of town planning to drug a meal would show up on a night where the target's meal would be something heavily spiced and thus capable of masking the drugs, isn't it? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the person who drugged the food was a member of the household, and chose the dinner menu that night for that very reason.</span></li><li> "Blue Carbuncle" is set in motion by a series of genuine coincidences.

Why? Because Holmes reasons that there is only so much you can hold in your head, and he needs only what is required for his profession. This was later ignored by Doyle. Despite apparently having nil knowledge of literature, Holmes is able to quote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohannWolfgangVonGoethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> in the original and is familiar with Thomas Carlyle.

Holmes notes that Ryder is already a nervous wreck after everything he's been through, and that he's too scared to ever commit a crime again. Putting Ryder in jail would only make him a jailbird for life, but letting him go after very nearly being ruined will keep him from ever doing wrong again.

However, in "The Valley of Fear", which was written after "The Final Problem" but takes place before it, Holmes already informs him about Moriarty and his terrible deeds, so Watson should've known about him in "The Final Problem". Of course, since "The Final Problem" is an account by Watson and he knows it will be the reader's first encounter with Moriarty, so there's no reason he couldn't insert a "fictitious" section introducing Moriarty for our benefit.</li><li> In "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty", Watson refers to another case he hasn't yet written about, "The Adventure of the Second Stain". He mentions some interesting facts about the case, specifically that the case "implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to make it public", and that it involved "Monsieur Dubuque of the Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side-issue". "The Adventure of the Second Stain" was finally published 11 years later, but it turns out that only one "first family" was implicated in the case, and there's no mention of Dubuque or Waldbaum in the story, nor does it seem very likely that anyone in Paris or Dantzig was ever involved in investigating the case.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan">Sharp-Dressed Man</a>: Holmes liked to dress well and, as noted above, in the books would <em>never</em> wear countrywear in the city.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockCanRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockCanRead">Sherlock Can Read</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> - In "The Adventure of the Yellow Face", Sherlock Holmes stuns the client of the day by giving his name before he'd introduced himself.<div class="indent"><strong>Holmes</strong>: My dear Mr. Grant Munro&#151;</div><div class="indent"><strong>Munro</strong>: What!
