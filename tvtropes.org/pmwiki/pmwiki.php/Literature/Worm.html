Cape politics, factions, rivalries, information warfare, and the individual problems of the people beneath the costumes put even the heroes in something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">gray area</a>. Taylor's actions in the midst of this leave her in a situation where she's forced to make some hard choices, facing the reality of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.</p><p>Bullying has also been featured as a major element in the plot and character development of the main character. Over the first few plot arcs, though, the story shifts away from the hellish landscape that is contemporary high school towards the more uplifting setting of a bombed out city at the mercy of a roving band of psychopaths.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Worm launched in June 2011 and updated regularly on Tuesdays and Saturdays (and some Thursdays) until the final chapter was posted in November 2013.

They span from meta-analysis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">wild mass guessing</a> from spot on to crackpot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkComedy">Dark Comedy</a>, to short stories in their own right.

Many of them have quite a few mental issues and have very dangerous powers. Mass killings, attacks against civilians, killing heroes, and large amounts of destruction are treated as shockingly common things. In other parts of the world, things are even worse with some places being true hellholes run by parahuman warlords. Trickster states that buildings in the Wormverse are built to be much tougher than normal because everyone is expecting an attack of some kind.</li><li> There is a vast, and powerful conspiracy of people that can give people powers and are committing large crimes against humanity on a regular basis. They claim they are doing it to save the world and have been doing it virtually unopposed/in secret for almost thirty years. They have had a hand in creating some of the worst monsters in the series, have potentially tens of thousands of victims they have killed, kidnapped, brainwashed, and worse. Despite it all, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their efforts might have been for nothing.</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The head of the main government hero organization is under the aforementioned conspiracy's control and have carefully controlled its leadership with the top three heroes in on the conspiracy. The last three PRT directors in Brockton Bay were a racist, secretly a murderous super villain, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> warmonger who was willing to cross any line, respectively. The other directors seen have not been much better. The organization itself has displayed numerous examples of needless stupidity, short sightedness, and questionable morals in its decisions. A few of the "heroes" aren't much better than many of the villains they fight.</span></li><li> The fringe elements that in our world are effectively powerless are much more dangerous in the wormverse if they can recruit parahumans. Cults, hate groups, even random drug dealers are much more powerful and influential.</li><li> The Birdcage has been called a monstrous, unfair, and terrible place by its creator, other PRT Directors, and many readers. You are not given a chance of parole and are at the mercy of the inmates. Many prisoners do not deserve to be there but are sent there because it is the only place that can hold parahumans.</li><li> As Taylor explains when she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">infiltrates Nilbog's territory,</span> the people in the Wormverse have to always wonder if this is the day someone terrible gets a terrible power and a lot of people get killed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nilbog</span> is so dangerous that he got away with killing thousands of people because the government is afraid of provoking him into expanding from his small town, the Nine have been in operation for at least a decade and have killed thousands, including children, without ever being stopped, and then there are the many other S class threats in the world which are exceptionally horrifying and powerful.</li><li> The Endbringers are slowly, systematically, and inevitably destroying the world piece by piece. They have killed tens of millions of people, and caused an unbelievable amount of destruction, pain, and suffering. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">All without putting any serious effort with their attacks.</a> When the world begins to celebrate when one of them is finally killed, many people fall into despair as three more show up. And it's heavily implied they were accidentally created by one of the world's most powerful heroes as a byproduct of his power.</span></li><li> It's all but stated that the Endbringers specifically target anyone who could make the world a better place in any meaningful way. Sphere, who was about to solve world hunger and the world's energy problems was corrupted into the serial killing Mannequin, Dragon's father was killed before he could <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">make more AI like her or ease her restrictions</span>, and Panacea was silenced before she could get the word out about the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">passengers and what Scion would ultimately do.</span></li><li> Not only is Brockton Bay, a Rust Belt city, in an economic death spiral, the rest of the world is far poorer economically than our own. Three to four major cities are heavily damaged every year, to the point that even the United States considers it acceptable to abandon a large chunk of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Los Angeles</span> rather than rebuild. The People's Republic of China was replaced by a xenophobic isolationist state, meaning hundreds of millions of its citizens were never raised out of poverty. Western Europe suffered from the Swiss population becoming Manchurian Agents for the Simurgh, and France in particular had a major nuclear plant disaster at Lyon. Australia has even sealed off the ruins of Canberra with a giant dome.</li><li> Many survivors of the Simurgh's attacks, civilians and trusted heroes alike, will either spend the rest of their lives quarantined from society and treated as pariahs, or they'll be executed. All out of fear that they may have been selected to make things worse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Not that it matters, since the quarantine procedures have been incorporated into her plans as well.</span></li><li> The "passengers" granting parahuman abilities <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">seem to be intelligent and actively promote conflict as a worldwide "proving ground" for passenger shards.</span></li><li> All that up above and it actually gets worse. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Scion, the only being who could fight off the Endbringers is actually the source of half of the world's parahumans and his goal all along was the destruction of the world. He decides to try and kill humanity off early thanks to Jack and starts blowing things up left and right.
