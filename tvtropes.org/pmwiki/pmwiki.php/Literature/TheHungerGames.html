Lose, and you die, likely in a painful and violent way. Certainly in a public way. The games are mandatory viewing for everyone in the country, including your family and anyone who may care about you, and there's always a full recap of each death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMurder">Accidental Murder</a>: Peeta accidentally kills <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Foxface with poison.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>: In <em>The Hunger Games</em>: Effie after Katniss described the Gamemakers' reaction to her firing at the apple in their roast pig's mouth. While everyone else (Katniss, Haymitch, Peeta, Cinna, and Portia) is laughing outright, Effie is suppressing a smile. After that she agrees that the Gamemakers did deserve that.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamSmithHatesYourGuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdamSmithHatesYourGuts">Adam Smith Hates Your Guts</a>: In-universe example.

This has caused Katniss to swear off the idea of getting married and having kids because she knows they'd have to face the Reaping. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She changes her mind, however. <em>Fifteen years</em> after the rebellion that brought an end to the Hunger Games.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: On one hand, you've got normal names like Annie and Johanna, but then on the other you've got more unusual names like Katniss, Peeta, Twill, Plutarch, and Beetee.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateNickname">Affectionate Nickname</a>:<ul><li> Gale calls Katniss "Catnip", though this is really due to her being so shy when they first met that she mumbled her name and he misheard her.</li><li> Occasionally used is 'little duck' from Katniss to Prim, due to the latter's habit of having her shirt tails untucked.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionHealingDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterActionHealingDrama">After-Action Healing Drama</a>: When Katniss finds Peeta in the arena, he has been slashed badly by Cato, and she has to treat him. And get medicine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: Some combination of wars and natural disasters destroyed the entire population of the world except for Panem (North America). There are implications that Panem represents the entire human species. District 12, the smallest District (possibly excluding 13), has a population of between 8,000 and 10,000. It also explains why, for all his machinations, Snow doesn't want to risk nuclear war.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirstripOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirstripOne">Airstrip One</a>: The Districts are numbered, and segregated by industry.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a>:<ul><li> Not even an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> like Cato deserves to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a> by Mutts for over <em>twenty hours</em></span>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note01q3p');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note01q3p" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note01q3p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Some sort of body armor that Cato most likely got from the feast earlier kept him from being instantly killed.</span></li><li> The way <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Glimmer</span> bites it is pretty nasty, especially her cries for help.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation">Amazing Technicolor Population</a>: The people in the Capitol have some strange fashion ideas, among them body dyes. At least one person mentioned has dyed her whole body pea green.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a>: Collins has stated that we're so far in the future that racial mixing has blurred any categories that might exist today. She refuses to elaborate on what modern races the characters would be categorized as. Katniss herself has olive skin and straight black hair, in contrast to her blonde-haired and blue-eyed mother and sister. Rue and Thresh have "dark skin." In <em>The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, the District 11 tribute, Reaper, is described as having dark brown skin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">And Man Grew Proud</a>: Zig-zagged. Technology in the Capitol, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>, far exceeds what we're capable of now, but the lower Districts are like third world countries. Some Capitolites are well-educated enough to know about the history of the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeforeTheDarkTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeforeTheDarkTimes">Before the Dark Times</a>, but Katniss only has a very vague idea of the Dark Days and the world before Panem.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalMotifs">Animal Motifs</a>: Katniss repeatedly compares President Snow to a snake, showing her distrust of him, and Rue to birds, highlighting her fondness for Rue and Rue's sweet and free-spirited nature. In-universe, Katniss is associated with a specific kind of bird called a mockingjay, which is an emblem of freedom and of the Capital's fallibility. Tigris looks and acts like a tigress so much that Katniss wonders if she picked the name herself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingArrows">Annoying Arrows</a>: An unusual example where the trope applies the protagonist's own attacks. The arrows Katniss shoots only do much damage if she hits a vital area.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">Anyone Can Die</a>: <em>The Hunger Games</em> is actually an interesting example. Many of the characters are <em>guaranteed</em> to die, due to the format of the Games; however, as with most other works, main characters are very rarely if ever killed (depending on who you'd be willing to count as a main character), and only in major events. Katniss, as the first person narrator, inevitably survives the entire series. Everyone else, however, is fair game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">especially in <em>Mockingjay</em>, where the country goes into a full-scale rebellion with heavy losses on both sides. And that does mean <em>everyone</em>.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">Apocalypse How</a>: At least continental, probably global. In the first book, Katniss describes a massive natural disaster: "the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land." Wars erupted as factions tried to claim the limited remaining resources, and this appears to have led to the collapse of the North American nations that we currently know. Some time after that, about 75 years before the present, a massive rebellion resulted in further destruction; District 13 was seen as a particular threat since they controlled the nuclear power and potentially weapons, so the Capitol bombed them into oblivion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcNumber">Arc Number</a>: Twelve. 12 districts, 12 pairs of tributes (who become eligible at age 12), training scores of up to 12, 12 arrows in the quiver in the arena, 12 houses in the Victor's Village, 24 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wedding</span> dresses designed for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Katniss</span>, then voted down to 6, lightning strikes at midnight and noon in a certain section of the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quarter Quell arena</span>, which later becomes important to the plot, and a 12 x 12 apartment in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">District 13</span>.

The Games themselves took place in the ruins of an arena within the Capitol, not in a specially constructed wilderness. The mentoring system was not introduced until the Tenth Games, but the earliest mentors were students at the Capitol's Academy, not past victors, possibly because at least three districts would have had yet to produce victors at that point.

The country's name is an adoption of Rome's "Bread and Circuses" motto. The Capitol is an incredibly authoritarian superpower that brutally reigns over conquered territories to feed the decadent desires of its own citizens. The gladiatorial parallels with the Hunger Games are obvious, of course. Parties at the Capitol feature guests who induce vomiting so that they can consume more food, which is popularly thought to have been common at Roman banquets. The Capitol residents almost all have Roman first names. As a bit of extra bonus, the lottery slips that entitle the residents of the districts to free food (at the cost of increasing their chances of being reaped) are called <em>Tesserae</em>. In Ancient Rome, the Tesserae Frumentariae are tokens handed out to citizens of Rome which can be exchanged for free grain.

In the end, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Katniss and Peeta are both covered in skin grafts and burns that the District 13 doctors gave only basic treatment for</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPsych">Hollywood Psych</a>:<ul><li> Though Haymitch is an alcoholic, in the first book he very conveniently decides to stay sober only when he needs to be on the condition that Peeta and Katniss not interfere with his drinking when he feels like it. Real alcoholism isn't quite that convenient. Bit better in later books when we see him at least having difficulty sobering up.<ul><li> Many real-life alcoholics do go through periods of sobriety in-between benders so Haymitch's sobriety in itself is not such a stretch. The fact that it happens from one day to the next, on the other hand...</li></ul></li><li> <em>Catching Fire</em> describes Annie as hysterical when she's reaped for the 75th games, without going into any sort of detail. This is enough to have Katniss think she's completely insane, though Katniss has never really understood overly emotional people. Later in <em>Mockingjay</em>, we meet Annie and Katniss seems to think she's just a little quirky, though she occasionally covers her ears with her hands for no apparent reason. In real life, a person covering their ears that way would imply that they are hearing things that aren't there. Being that this isn't a one off (she does it "occasionally") it's a pretty big alarm bell for a psychotic disorder not otherwise specified. So apparently Katniss was right the first time, though at the point in <em>Mockingjay</em> when Katniss actually meets Annie, she herself has become even more psychologically damaged, either allowing her to relate better to Annie's "quirks", or deciding that she has no right to judge. This change in opinion also happens after her friendship with Finnick develops, whereas before she'd never met him. Her defense of and possible friendship towards Annie might be a result of that, seeing her more the way Finnick sees her rather than how the majority might.</li><li> Hijacking. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The way Tracker Jacker venom works in the first book is somewhat questionable</span>, but in <em>Mockingjay</em> it really doesn't make sense as a conditioning tool. For one, the brain really doesn't work that way. Conditioning is an unconscious mechanism that can't be manipulated into a deliberate response the way the book describes. This is why the CIA stopped trying to do this in the first place. For another, the part of the brain that controls fear is so separate from your memory that it's unlikely that a drug designed to affect the fear part of your brain would have any affect on memory whatsoever.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotWings">Hot Wings</a>: One of the outfits Cinna designs for Katniss burns away its outer layer when she twirls, leaving a smoking mockingjay costume, a symbol of rebellion.

All we hear about the district itself is that they grow grain &mdash; nothing about its sympathies or role in uprisings against the Capitol. Their generic status continues in the prequel, where both of their tributes die early in the Tenth Hunger Games.

In the book, the Muttations have the same hair color and eyes as the tributes they were created from. In the movie, the correspondence is much subtler. They all look like brown dog-wolves, but their CGI facial expressions are based on the actors who played the tributes.<ul><li> Although she later reflects that the Muttations probably didn't actually contain any parts of the dead tributes - they were just made to look like them for the additional psychological terror.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSacrifice">Human Sacrifice</a>: Tributes are sacrificed by the Capitol to remember the betrayal of District 13.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle">Hungry Jungle</a>: a staple for the arenas at the Hunger Games.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion">Icon of Rebellion</a>: The mockingjay pin, and later Katniss herself in her guise as The Mockingjay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>: Katniss and Peeta toss this back and forth in the first book: Katniss seems to be very bad at reading people.

Katniss is a determined fighter and an excellent archer. Her strategy is to put on a brave face so as to not appear weak.

His last name, Mellark, is a Greek word meaning "cake," which Peeta is adept at frosting.</li><li> Haymitch sounds like the Yiddish word "haymish", meaning "folksy" or "home-like". Katniss considers him "from home", as he's from not just her District, but her social strata.</li><li> Effie "Trinket" seems to be trivial and shallow (but Effie is short for Euphemia - well-spoken- belying her skill as a speaker).</li><li> Cinna was the name of various Roman figures relevant to his character, namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a doomed opponent of Sulla the dictator, one of Julius Caesar's assassins, a poet mistaken for the same and beaten to death by an angry mob, and a conspirator against Augustus Caesar.</span></li><li> One of the meanings of "Rue" is "regret." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her death haunts Katniss, who failed to protect her</span> and those in power probably rue the day she was chosen for the arena.</li><li> Avox means, in an awkward and incorrect mixture of Greek and Latin, 'without a voice.'</li><li> "Coriolanus," as in "Coriolanus Snow" refers to a hated Roman who betrayed both sides and died loathed and friendless.</li><li> Tigris had plastic surgery to look like a human-tiger hybrid.

Like their counterparts in the Shakespeare play, Titus was known for cannibalism, and Lavinia had her tongue cut out. Peeta's comments about 'fingers and toes' are unfortunate implications, given what other things happened to Lavinia in the play.</li><li> Panem is a reference to the Latin phrase "panem et circenses", meaning "bread and circuses", or idiomatically, sustenance and entertainment &mdash; the two things you need to give a population to keep them happy.</li><li> District 1, luxury goods, gives us Marvel, Glimmer, Gloss, and Cashmere.</li><li> District 3, electronics, has Wiress.

Chaff is a double example. Not only does it mean "the husks of grains and grasses that are separated during threshing," but it also means, "worthless matter." Chaff never becomes important to the plot. Seeder is obvious.</li><li> District 12, coal mining, has Peeta (Peter, meaning "stone") and of course Katniss' nickname; "The Girl Who Was On Fire."</li><li> The Capitol uses Roman names, in reference to their technological superiority as well as their decadent culture.</li><li> District 2 is noted for having the closest relationship to the Capitol, and their male tributes also have Roman names: Cato and Brutus. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This makes sense considering that District 2 provides most of the Peacekeepers.

"Clove" is past tense for "to cleave," meaning "to split or sever."</li><li> In Katniss' case it's a nickname, but the drama largely boils down to "The Girl On <strong>Fire</strong>" against President <strong>Snow</strong>.</li><li> Volumnia Gaul.

There's a dark aside in Book 1 where Katniss mentions how one year the only weapons provided were horribly awkward maces.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine">Weather-Control Machine</a>: The gamemakers can control the environment inside the arena, from weather to whether it's night or day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture">We Will Use Manual Labor in the Future</a>: The ruling class of Panem relies on keeping the vast majority of its population as essentially slave labor despite possessing technology on a level which makes localized weather control possible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>:<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"It's Primrose Everdeen."</span></li><li> "the male and female tributes will be reaped from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> their existing pool of victors."</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Katniss, there is no District 12."</span></li><li> "President Snow used to...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sell me...my body, that is."</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"My lips are just forming his name when his fingers lock around my throat."</span></li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> "And then the second round of parachutes goes off."</span></li><li> As a rule, chapters tend to end with lines that are wham on at least a small degree.</li><li> In-universe, Peeta is the acknowledged master of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>, particularly when onstage with Caesar Flickerman. In the first book he sets up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> thing, and in the second he manages an even bigger one: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He claims he and Katniss are having a baby. Double so since just before, he claims they're already married, making sure the reader is blindsided by the baby thing.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatExactlyIsHisJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatExactlyIsHisJob">What, Exactly, Is His Job?</a>: Katniss asks this question regarding the entire population of the Capitol.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: The trilogy leaves quite a few questions unanswered:<ul><li> We never learn <em>why</em> Cinna requested District 12 (as he says he did in book 1) and we never find out if Portia did the same. We also have no clue why Cinna doesn't have a Capitol accent or the Capitol sense of style, despite that not making much sense if he's a fashion designer who's lived in the Capitol for his entire life.<ul><li> Cinna mentioned he thought that the coal miner outfits were weak, tired, and unflattering. It's possible he just wanted to do a better job.</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Catching Fire</em>, Johanna says <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone she loves is dead.</span> It feels like it's going to be important for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, but.... Elaboration? Explanation? Don't count on it. There's a popular guess in fanon, though: most likely Johanna's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">family was murdered by the Capitol, likely for refusing to be used by the Capitol after she won like Finnick was.</span> Based on her personality and what Finnick says about his family being threatened, this seems the logical explanation.</li><li> In <em>Mockingjay</em>, Katniss gets a bow with "special properties." She never once mentions them again, uses them, or even explains what those properties are, besides the fact that it can vibrate to say hello. This could be the reason it's able to shoot down planes, though.</li><li> What happened to Old Cray? He somehow disappeared when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thread took over.</span> It's not pointed out what exactly happened to him.</li><li> Why were Lavinia and her companion fleeing the Capitol to District 12? It's likely they may have been <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">trying to get to District 13</span> for some reason, but how did a couple of Capitol kids come to be running away when most adults never develop the courage, or even the inclination in most cases?</li><li> Bonnie and Twill were also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">trying to get to District 13</span> in <em>Catching Fire</em>, and wound up being fairly close to where Lavinia was when she was captured. The last Katniss sees of them, they're successfully hiding out and planning their next move, but when Katniss and co. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reach District 13 in the final book</span>, Bonnie and Twill are nowhere to be seen. Katniss briefly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Waves</a> their absence, commenting that it must be incredibly rare for those who flee to actually <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">reach District 13</span>... then they're never mentioned again.</li><li> Commander Lyme is introduced in <em>Mockingjay</em> as a former victor and leader of the rebels in District 2. She's built up as if she's going to be important somehow, but when the surviving victors have their meeting towards the end of the book, she's nowhere in sight and is never mentioned (though the reader must assume she's been killed at some point in the interim, as it is stressed that <em>all</em> surviving victors are present).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">What Kind of Lame Power Is Heart, Anyway?</a>: Subverted. Katniss sees Peeta as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">The Heart</a> and thinks his power to love is much better than her ability to kill things. (During the games, it IS useful to gain sponsors.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTheClockStrikesTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenTheClockStrikesTwelve">When the Clock Strikes Twelve</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Given the nature of the arena used by the Quarter Quell.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>: The Districts have a few geographical clues but otherwise the readers don't really learn where they are. <a class="urllink" href="http://aimmyarrowshigh.livejournal.com/32461.html">That didn't stop people from trying to map it, though.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> One of the only things agreed on is that District 12 is meant to be Appalachia, most likely the coal-mining regions of Virginia and West Virginia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDidItHaveToBeSnakes">Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?</a>: Tough-as-nails <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Johanna Mason</span> is undone by water... because when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she</span> was a prisoner of the Capitol, they soaked <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> and then electrocuted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> as part of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> torture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWasps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWasps">Wicked Wasps</a>: The tracker jackers have been twisted by Capitol biotech beyond any level of aggression that real wasps would display; they act less like territorial animals and more like insanely aggressive living weapons. They can track targets for at least a mile, their stings instantly create agonizing plum-sized lumps, and the hallucinations caused by their venom can drive a person insane. They were created to be an equivalent to land mines to be spread around rebel territories, and have been kept around by the Capitol as a symbol of their power over their subjects.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillNotBeAVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillNotBeAVictim">Will Not Be a Victim</a>: Invoked and then exploited.

For one thing, she doesn't want to fall in love, get married and have children that might end up in the Hunger Games, so she resists her budding feelings for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Peeta. Gale professing his romantic feelings confuses her and a minor triangle plays out for a few chapters of the second book, then ultimately she chooses to be with Peeta but doesn't start a family with him until fifteen years after the end of the war</span>. The movies play it up like a big triangle by adding scenes that allude to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Katniss having feelings for Gale</span> and remove the majority of the scenes that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shows she's falling for Peeta</span>, presumably to cash in on the shipper war hype of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> but it's mostly lead to a negative response and was toned down for the third film.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds</a>: All the characters who participated in the Hunger Games, especially the Careers, had little choice but to participate in what amounts to mass slaughter. Even Cato and Clove, the most ruthless characters in the first book, were to some degree pitiable, especially the former in the film.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfNoGrandparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfNoGrandparents">World of No Grandparents</a>:<ul><li> It's stated a few times that the family of Mrs. Everdeen ran an apothecary in the town. Yet, when she underwent catatonic after her husband died, nobody stepped in to take care of Katniss and Prim, who were in danger of being thrown to a community center until the former forced herself to become the family's breadwinner.</li><li> In fact, there are only two known grandparents in the whole series: Greasy Sae, whose mentally ill granddaughter is mentioned a few times; and President Snow, whose granddaughter is mentioned by Johanna as a potential tribute for the Revenge Hunger Games. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If Katniss' mother lives until the epilogue, then add her.</span> Justified as most of Panem's population barely earn enough a living to sustain two generations, let alone three.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">Would Hit a Girl</a>: There are just as many girls as boys in each Hunger Game, ensuring a lot of boys hitting girls. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marvel kills Rue, and Thresh kills Clove.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">Would Hurt a Child</a>: Everyone in the Hunger Games is between the ages of 12-18.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreathedInFlames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreathedInFlames">Wreathed in Flames</a>: Part of Katniss' symbology (along with being a mockingjay).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">You Bastard!</a>: Look at the Capitol and then look at you. The book is even stylistically written in a fashion that gets the reader compelled by the violence and the romance but with undertones that this sort of enjoyment is wrong. In fact, anyone who still loves the series for all the shallow reasons is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">flipped off</a> in <em>Mockingjay</em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> all their favorite characters die off and their badass heroine becomes a PTSD-stricken shell</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">You Gotta Have Blue Hair</a>: The people living in the Capitol dye their hair some pretty wild colors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">You Have Failed Me</a>: Snow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">has Crane killed after Crane declares both Katniss and Peeta winner of the 74th Hunger Games. Otherwise they both would have committed suicide, and there would be no winner, likely angering many people in the process, especially in the districts, which President Snow warned him about earlier.
