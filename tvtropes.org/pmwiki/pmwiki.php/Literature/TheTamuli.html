The incompetent King Aldreas has died under mysterious circumstances, and his youthful heir Ehlana is on the verge of death, her life preserved solely by an extremely risky spell. The city&mdash;and the kingdom of Elenia it rules&mdash;now is controlled in all but name by the corrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">Primate Annias</a> of the Elene Church, who's put a puppet ruler in control and is stripping the treasury bare to pay for his private campaign for the head of the Church. And his ally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">fallen Pandion Knight</a> Martel, is stirring up trouble across the continent to discredit and ultimately destroy the Church Knights to which Sparhawk belongs.<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Gathering a party of various companions, including champions of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Knights</a>, sorcerers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Styricum</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue">street thieves</a>, and his squire, Sparhawk sets out- both to thwart the designs of Annias, and to find a cure for the queen's suspicious illness.

He needs several strong men to carry his litter around (having long ago lost the ability to move under his own power) and is frequently described as a "slug" by the other characters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvantageBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvantageBall">Advantage Ball</a>: The Church Knights, by dint of their training, reputation, and armor, which is not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">protective</a> but intimidating as well, tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomp</a> any enemy force in combat, regardless of the opposition's numbers, equipment or tactics. The individual Knights tend to do this as well.<ul><li> The Lamorks as well, by virtue of using crossbows, which can pierce even the armor of the Church Knights.</li><li> The Cyrgai possessed this in the distant past due to their advanced military strategies which made them a major threat to their more primitive neighbors. Most modern races hold the ball in comparison to the Cyrgai due to changes in military tactics and equipment.</li><li> In the <em>Tamuli,</em> this is the Atans' hat. They outclass everyone else to such an extent that entire enemy armies have surrendered rather than fight them. Mirtai demonstrates that even Church Knights are no match in dismounted combat by knocking Kalten on his ass without much effort - mounted knights would probably be more of a challenge as Atans don't seem to use missile weapons or polearms.</li><li> The Atans' lack of polearms and ranged weapons becomes an issue when encountering Trolls and Klael-soldiers, both of whom are more than a march for an Atan in hand-to-hand. The only ranged weapon the Atans use is the bow, but bows are for hunting exclusively and not considered "proper" weapons of war. Kring and Berit run themselves ragged trying to convince the Atans that javelins and crossbows are proper weapons of war.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorVillain">Alas, Poor Villain</a>: After everything Martel has done, when he lies dying Sparhawk and Sephrenia both gather to his side and mourn his death.

Armor is key to the Church Knights' way of battle, and while Atans fight in light armor they never actually clash with heavily armored troops and have the advantage of sheer size anyways.</li><li> Played straight with Azash's undead guardians in the end of the first trilogy. They all wear huge menacing armor with spikes that look very frightening, because that's what the Zemochs thought armor was for - but they never understood the <em>real</em> purpose for armor, so the Zemoch armor is clumsy, incredibly unwieldy, and doesn't even protect properly; all those spikes only serve to direct a blow towards weak points instead of deflecting them. In fact, the armor is <em>worse</em> than useless.</li><li> Also played with in the case of Adus, not because the armor is inherently useless but because it doesn't fit right. Also averted in that once he's down, his killer (an eight-year-old boy) needs help to get a sword through his breastplate to deliver a <em>coup de grace</em>.</li><li> Played with with Martel. It is not that his armor is <em>useless</em> (he <em>is</em> a trained Church Knight), but out of vanity he has his armor made in the finest (and heaviest) style in the world, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">gold details and ornamentation on it</a>, which tires him faster than the equally-skilled and equally-aged Sparhawk. And he admits it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with his dying breaths.</span></li><li> Played straight, however, whenever crossbows are involved.

This is due to them being such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> that generational blood feuds can be started over a disagreement about the weather, and so they as a race offered themselves as slaves to the Tamuls. However, their "slavery" consists entirely of them agreeing to not kill anyone without permission and serve as the Tamuls' army, which allows them to be warriors and have glorious battles, without bringing their race to the edge of extinction from everyone killing everyone else for the slightest reason. And the Atans are all happy with this arrangement.</li><li> This is exemplified with Mirtai's case, where instead of the normal institutionalized slavery of her people, she was kidnapped and forced into a more personal slavery. But despite hating the more personal nature of her slavery (no, not <em>that</em> way), she repeatedly refused and scoffed at any attempt to free her by Ehlana after she became her "slave", always saying that it was impossible for her people to ever be free, normally followed by a long list of people Ehlana knows that Mirtai would have killed by now for some type of insult if she had been free.<ul><li> To clarify, she tells Ehlana at one point that, had she been free, she would have killed a major character for the unpardonable sin of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">allowing his shadow to touch her.</a></li></ul></li><li> It's worse than it sounds. A high-ranking Tamul official, outraged over Arjuni slave raids, once authorized a punitive Atan expedition into Arjuna&mdash;without giving them any limits. They actually hanged the King and drove his subjects into the southern jungles, thus starting an economic crisis. It took centuries to convince the Arjuni to emerge from their hiding place.</li><li> Alean, in a way. As a servant girl, she has no complaints about her indentured status other than her first employer (a noble notorious for his misdeeds, including raping his servants) and the fact that she and Kalten can't get married due to her common status.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealItWithBooze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealItWithBooze">Heal It with Booze</a>: In the first book, Sparhawk does first aid on one of his companions by scrubbing the wound out with some cheap wine before bandaging it.

It's revealed in <em>The Shining Ones</em> that she's also a criminal (her father shaved the edges of coins and re-milled them in order to create a rather significant fortune, and Melidere kept up the work).</li><li> Kalten as well.

There are several issues, though; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">firstly, Sephrenia starts out loathing her, due to old racial prejudice (and the fact she thinks Xanetia's people killed her family), causing everyone to futilely attempt reasoning with her, and she eventually breaks from the group for a while. Secondly everyone else on the continent is terrified of the Delphae and Xanetia is almost constantly in disguise, which she admits is somewhat painful for her. Thirdly, she is not only a helper, she is a hostage for her people's good faith; if they betray the party, Xanetia - effectively their crown princess - is to be killed.</span> This causes various degrees of tension for some time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoutStrength">Stout Strength</a>: By the time of the <em>Tamuli</em>, the knights of Sparhawk's generation are middle-aged, and they're no longer as slim and trim as they once were.

At this point they're so hopelessly inbred and isolated they can barely function.

This sparked a feud between the races that was never resolved, and the actual truth was blurred so much that pretty much everyone has their own story. Sparhawk repeatedly asks Xanetia and Sephrenia to tell him the truth, and when they refuse, he threatens to ask Bhelliom, since it's a neutral observer. This horrifies both of them, but eventually Sparhawk gets so fed up of their bitchy cat-fight that he tells them that he no longer cares about what happened, and just he wants their fighting to stop.
