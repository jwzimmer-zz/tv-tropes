David Lister's birthday party begins in Brighton, and apparently ends on Mimas. At any rate, that's where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDidIDoLastNight">he wakes up with a wicked hangover, no money or ID and a worrying rash</a>. He takes to stealing taxis in order to try to make enough money for a ticket home. One of his fares is Arnold Judas Rimmer, a low-ranking crewman on board the ship Red Dwarf. After some hijinks involving Rimmer's visit to a robo-brothel, Lister signs on with the Red Dwarf in the mistaken belief that this will get him to Earth faster. When he learns that the ship is on a multi-year mission to the outer solar system, at the end of which he will be an old man (over 25, by Lister's calculation), Lister comes up with a scheme to spend the voyage in stasis, and keep his youth. He purchases a cat at the next landfall, and ensures that he is found to own it, upon which he is put in stasis as a penalty for bringing an unauthorized life-form on board. Shortly afterwards, the crew is killed by a radiation leak, and Holly, the ship's computer, takes it into deep space. Three million years later, the radiation has fallen to survivable levels, and Lister is let out of stasis, to find that his only companions are Holly, Arnold Rimmer's holographic ghost, and the last living descendant of his pet cat, although they soon find a crashed ship inhabited by the mechanoid Kryten, who killed the crew and destroyed the ship by giving the computer components a good wash.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p><strong>Novels:</strong></p><ul><li> <em>Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers</em> by "Grant Naylor" (1989)</li></ul>The above summary describes the events of this novel. In the climax, after an adaptation of the "Me<sup>2</sup>" storyline, the crew seemingly arrives at Earth... only to end with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> that they have, in fact, fallen into the grips of the Total Immersion Video-Game "Better Than Life".<p></p><ul><li> <em>Better Than Life</em> by "Grant Naylor" (1990)</li></ul>The only direct sequel of the four novels, this opens with Lister, Rimmer and the Cat escaping from "Better Than Life", only to find that in their absence, Holly has had to switch off due to a failed attempt to restore his intelligence that instead drastically reduced his lifespan. This has left Red Dwarf on minimal power and plummeting into the path of a planet. Attempts to blast the planet out of the ship's way leave Lister stranded on the planet, and the rest of the crew stuck on the event horizon of a black hole. By the time they escape, Lister has become an old man on what is revealed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the long-abandoned Earth</span>, which he has begun slowly terraforming back to a livable state with the aid of the giant cockroach inhabitants. When he returns to the ship, a polymorph sneaks aboard and starts stalking the occupants for their emotional energy. Although they ultimately kill it, Lister dies of a heart attack. The rest of the crew fix this by placing Lister into a dimension where time runs backwards, promising to return for him when he has reverse-aged back to his young adulthood, and giving him a chance to enjoy a backwards life with Kristine Kochanski.<p></p><ul><li> <em>Last Human</em> by Doug Naylor (1995)</li></ul>The first of the "trilogy closer" novels, and where the continuity of the book first forks. Having de-aged back to his young adulthood, Lister and Kristine return to Red Dwarf and the forwards-temporal universe. After a number of offpage misadventures, they run into trouble when they enter a civilized space-nation made up of Gelfs, where Lister falls afoul of corrupt laws being used to gather people to be used for a terraforming experiment. Things are further complicated when it turns out that his prison is also home to a Lister from a parallel universe, one where Lister became a psychopath, who escapes and is taken aboard Red Dwarf before they realize who he is. The terraforming world turns out to be home to a violently destructive psionic entity called "The Rage", a living embodiment of the resentment and fury of all the injustly-imprisoned and tortured souls who were forced to be part of the experiment. The Rage ultimately kills the Evil Lister, before Arnold Rimmer, having been emboldened by meeting the son he never knew he'd fathered on Yvonne McGruder, commits a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to destroy the Rage. The experiment is finally completed successfully and the planet becomes a paradise, where Lister and Kochanski decide to become the Adam and Eve of a new human civilization.<p></p><ul><li> <em>Backwards</em> by Rob Grant (1996)</li></ul>The second of the "trilogy closer" novels. The novel opens with Rimmer, Kryten and the Cat returning to Htrae, the backwards Earth, to pick up Lister, only to find themselves caught up in an unforeseen chronal incident involving Kryten accidentally reverse-murdering a man, stranding them on Htrae for a further ten negative years. Returning to their own dimension, they find that Red Dwarf has been captured by the last remnants of the Agonids &mdash; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRobot">Killer Robots</a> created and then abandoned by humanity centuries ago who have transformed the Dwarf into a prison/torture palace/obstacle course, where they plan to imprison Lister and then fight it out to see which of them will get the privilege of torturing Lister to death. With Starbug severely depleted of power, the Dwarfers have no choice but to return to the Red Dwarf, but are interrupted when Ace Rimmer, a parallel version of Rimmer who is a total badass instead of a total smeghead, transports into their dimension. They make plans together to overcome the Agonoids, but ship repairs are disrupted when one Agonoid, having been launched into space as a result of internecine conflict aboard the Red Dwarf, lands on their ship. Ace Rimmer makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to kill the Agonoid, and the Dwarfers grimly return to the Red Dwarf, where they find that the Agonoids have been all wiped out by the most malevolent and ambitious of their kind, as he launches from Red Dwarf and traps them aboard Starbug. They manage to defeat this last Agonoid, but not before he infects Starbug's NaviComp with the Armageddon Virus, which will send Starbug and Ace's attached ship crashing into a nearby planet. Kryten makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to try and come up with an antidote to the Armageddon Virus, with the crew assisting him by using the Virtual Reality gaming console to link into Kryten's mind, but the virus is destroyed too late; Kryten and Rimmer are both dead, and Starbug doesn't have enough fuel to stop from crashing. Lister and the Cat cram into Ace's ship, detach from Starbug, and jump to a random new dimension. By good fortune, they arrive in a parallel reality where Kryten and Rimmer never interfaced into the Better Than Life game, resulting in this universe's Lister and Cat starving to death. Asserting that this is as good as it'll probably get, Lister and the Cat begin docking procedures, ready to make a fresh start in this dimension.<p></p><hr><h2>The novels provide examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>:<ul><li> The "Future Echoes" featured in <em>Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers</em> show Lister with twin boys at some point in the near future, with a future echo of a very old Lister also appearing. However, both <em>Last Human</em> and <em>Backwards</em> ended with the Dwarfers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in another reality</span>, meaning it would be impossible for those future echoes to come to to pass.</li><li> The entire <em>Nova 5</em> duality jump drive arc is dropped after the first book. Of course, by the time the crew escapes the <em>Better Than Life</em> simulation, they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BlackHoles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BlackHoles">slightly more pressing concerns</a> and in both authors' separate books, returning Lister from his resurrection on Backwards Earth is something that requires a smaller vessel.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> In <em>Better Than Life</em>, the newly super-intelligent Holly reveals that Lister is the creator of the universe. This revelation is never brought up again.</li><li> In <em>Better Than Life</em> Lister's objective after being rescued from Garbage World is to somehow tow it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually the abandoned Earth</span> back to our solar system.

For some reason, the disaster did not happen in Ace Rimmer's universe, despite it having no connection to his presence (or lack thereof) on the ship, with the the one real difference being that Ace was held back in school, while Prime Rimmer wasn't (which led to Lister having a bunkmate on the ship who encouraged him to apply himself).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>: A lot, due to compression, but some biggies include:<ul><li> The elderly Cat Priest from "Waiting for God". Instead, the Cat is the only Cat person left on <em>Red Dwarf</em>.</li><li> Lister trying to revive Kochanski as a hologram, and the whole plot of "Balance of Power" and "Confidence and Paranoia". Instead, Rimmer creates the duplicate by using the <em>Nova 5</em>'s systems instead.</li><li> Lister trying to teach Kryten to rebel against his programming never happens, and Kryten instead remains an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">Extreme Doormat</a>.</li><li> In the audiobook adaptation of <em>Backwards</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire western simulation in Kryten's psyche is excised with Kryten and Rimmer instead being sucked out into space when Kryten shoots out <em>Starbug</em>'s hull to get rid of D'juhn Keep. The end result is more or less the same, as in the book Kryten doesn't create the dove program in time to save the ship's navicom, forcing Lister and The Cat to use Ace's ship. Still, it's a pretty smegging big thing to remove as the western simulation made up around a third of the book or more!</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalIntelligence">Adaptational Intelligence</a>: The show's Lister would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">eventually show</a> he was actually pretty clever in his way, being more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> than anything else. The books' Lister shows, through meticulously researching his plan to get put into stasis to get back to Earth without doing any work, that he's far more intelligent from the off.<ul><li> In the novel, the only reason he is the lowest ranked member of the ship is because he only signed up as a crewmember so he could get a paid ride back to Earth, and didn't particularly care what position he had.</li><li> The first book shows what he can do when he applies himself. He not only manages to repair Kryten, but also becomes an expert on thorium mining after three days of hard study.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalVillainy">Adaptational Villainy</a>:<ul><li> Rimmer's brothers. The show generally shows they were pretty horrible to him, once playing a "prank" where they tied him down and smeared him in jam, before covering him in ants, but here they nearly killed him at one point, requiring Rimmer to need CPR. Also, Frank apparently encouraged a young Rimmer to throw stones at a Dead Person's Rights march.</li><li> Subverted in <em>Backwards</em>: we're introduced to Ace from the viewpoint of a failing test pilot convinced he'll fail his next exam. When Ace pulls rank privileges (like claiming all the barstools in an empty bar), is a spectacular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to him and threatens the barmaid he has a crush on, the trainee knocks him out - giving the impression Ace will (somehow) be a complete dick here. Later on, it turns out Ace and the barmaid set up the incident to give the pilot confidence in his own abilities.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDeviation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDeviation">Adaptation Deviation</a>:<ul><li> The Polymorph's methods in <em>Better Than Life</em> differ from the forms it takes in the show.<ul><li> When attempting to push Lister to the brink of fear, it turns itself into a rat, rather than a snake.</li><li> Instead of using the appearance of Rimmer's mother to provoke his anger, the Polymorph turns itself into digital data, invades Rimmer's personality files, and forces him to relive countless frustrations and moments of anger.</li></ul></li><li> Since the events of "Marooned" and "White Hole" are merged, after <em>Starbug</em>'s crash on the ice planet, rather than Lister and Rimmer bickering while stuck, Rimmer gets dragged back to <em>Red Dwarf</em>, leaving Lister entirely on his own.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>: The novels turn an episodic TV series into a sprawling adventure. Each of them takes particular episodes from the series and incorporates their plots into one long narrative, integrated with original material. The first novel is much more heavily based on episodes of the series than its sequels, and also has a much more meandering plot. However, its non-episodic nature means it moves between events far quicker than the series; the crew's encounter with Kryten, which took place in the first episode of season 2 of the show, happens not long after the "Future Echoes" incident (which was episode 2 of season 1). Conversely, the two Rimmers have months here, rather than mere days in the show, to completely fall out with each other.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>: For the episodes that are incorporated into the novels' plots, they go deeply in-depth and add a lot of detail that wasn't or couldn't be realised on screen.

Another is the ship's drive room; initially depicted in the series as a medium size room with a handful of operatives, here, it is much larger, with dozens of crew members working constantly.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationNameChange">Adaptation Name Change</a>: The Simulants from the TV series were renamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Agonoids</a> in <em>Backwards</em>, likely because <em>Last Human</em> had also briefly used Simulants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>:<ul><li> Petersen, who is introduced swilling down a twelve-pack of whiskey, only stopping to let Lister have a sip or two.

However, an officer unexpectedly picks on him at a bar one night, harassing his crush in the process - eventually provoking Billy-Joe into fighting back and kicking the officer's ass.

While they remain funny, the books are a sci-fi series with some high stakes (and funny.)<ul><li> The novels retain the absurdist humour, but devotes much of a chapter to Lister having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">spectacular mental breakdown</a> in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrowningMySorrows">Drowning My Sorrows</a> is <em>not</em> played for comedy in the least. Rimmer's massive self-image problems and crippling neuroses aren't played for laughs quite so much either, and he's made slightly more rounded as a result.</li><li> <em>Better Than Life</em> and its effects are notably far more morbid than in the show: it's made quite clear that the game is cripplingly addictive thanks to it tapping directly into the user's subconscious.

As a result, Lister's reality in particular is based far more on his hidden desires and sentimentalities than the generically extravagant wishes he makes in the TV version of <em>BTL</em>. However, it is mentioned that earlier versions of the game did work as it did in the show, but it wasn't nearly as addictive because people could tell they were in a virtual world as everything came so easily so the immersion was lost. While the TV show made it clear that Rimmer's brain was rebelling against him due to his inability to accept nice things, the novel takes it even further by reinforcing that Rimmer genuinely believes he is worthless on a subconscious level, with the result that the company he has created in the game collapses on the day of his second wedding, his new solid body is repossessed as part of his bankruptcy, and he is subsequently stuck in a female body and almost forced to pimp himself out while stuck with a pair of criminals who have stolen his original body.</li><li> In <em>Backwards</em> we see the concept of a life lived in reverse through Lister's eyes, and it's not nearly as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> as the TV version. Most heartbreaking is the reveal that due to everyone's memory running in reverse (bar his), he lived happily with Kochanski until time reversed to the point they met - then she forgot about him entirely.</li><li> In the same novel we see quite a few things from Ace Rimmer's point of view: while he is undoubtedly insanely courageous and selfless, we also see he's not quite as sure of himself as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdealHero">Ideal Hero</a> TV version, quite openly dreading meeting another version of himself in case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHatePastMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHatePastMe">that Rimmer</a> had somehow contributed more to humanity than him.</li><li> Also from <em>Backwards</em> Kryten/Sheriff Will Carton's hopeless drunkenness isn't played for any laughs, instead being portrayed as an incredibly depressing story of how he's become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a> as the virus wipes out more of his functions to the point he doesn't remember who he is and is willing to both beg for scraps from/lie to the personifications of his remaining mental processes to get more booze.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepImmersionGaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepImmersionGaming">Deep-Immersion Gaming</a>: "Better Than Life" is even more immersive in the novels than in the TV series, to the point that the game erases any memory of the player beginning to play and conjures semi-realistic explanations for why they suddenly have everything they ever wanted. As a result, players tend to die of starvation in short order unless somebody is caring for them in reality. The game is treated like a street drug and banned accordingly, with analogous "game heads" and "game dealers".<ul><li> Another example appears in <em>Backwards</em> when Lister, Cat and Rimmer use the VR gaming technology to join Kryten in his head (in a simulation resembling a western) to help him fight off the Apocalypse Virus.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>: The Cat in <em>Last Human.</em> He's a constant presence and gets a lot of focus in the other three novels, but in this one he's very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> outside a couple of token moments, and is conveniently not present for most of the important scenes, including the dramatic final confrontation with Lister's evil double and the Rage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">Didn't Think This Through</a>: In <em>Last Human</em>, the Gelfs in charge of creating a gestalt entity intended to terraform a new planet for their civilization to live on managed this <em>twice</em>.<ul><li> First, they created one from the minds of convicted criminals.

However, they are not allowed to vote and killing them is technically not considered murder. This leads to a small uprising, which is swiftly put down.

However, when they decide to leave they wake up on Red Dwarf unharmed by the weeks they have spent effectively comatose, Lister notices that toast always lands face up when dropped, and finally three people are discovered alive and in stasis; Lister's crush Kochanski, his drinking buddy Petersen, and Rimmer's living self. Lister realizes that things are <em>still</em> perfect, and that they are therefore still in the game.

He's quickly subjected to increasingly demeaning treatment by the Jittermans, ranging from sexist insults to physical abuse. As a result, Rimmer begins to reflect on his attitude towards women, and how most of the female characters in his BTL fantasy were there to fuel his ego or sexually excite him; eventually, he finally realizes how miserable and screwed-up he really is especially after discovering that the woman he was to marry before the body swap was a younger version of his own mother. Perhaps as a result of this, after escaping from BTL with the rest of the crew, Rimmer is a much nicer person - to the point of deferring to Kristine Kochanski in Last Human - though he never loses his trademark sarcasm.</li><li> In <em>Last Human,</em> Lister is forced to sign up for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideMission">Suicide Mission</a> in exchange for being released from Cyberia, but is allowed to spend his final night with an enslaved symbi-morph by the name of Reketrebn.

The game is almost impossible to leave, because in order to leave, somebody has to not only realise they're in the game, but also <em>want</em> to leave. As a result, the person's real-life body will eventually waste away and die. The first novel ends with Lister having to make the decision whether to stay in the simulation or travelling back to an Earth <em>six million</em> years in the future where he may well be the last human as he understands it.

The Cat is so vain and self-absorbed that he lives in a golden castle with a milk moat, being waited on by six-foot topless Valkyries - this finally convinces the others that they cannot accept this as reality. Kryten can come and go freely as he has no hopes, dreams, or desires besides getting a new squeezy-mop - but the game takes advantage of his servility and gives him plenty of cleaning chores to keep him happy. For Lister, all he wants is to be happily married with a family - which is a perfectly healthy desire which the game easily fulfils. Rimmer however utterly loathes himself, and BTL builds him up with a handsome new body, vast wealth and fame, screaming fangirls and a fabulously beautiful (but shallow and spoilt) wife, for the sole purpose of tearing it away - eventually dumping his consciousness in a cheap hooker and very nearly being pimped out. And then, when he goes looking for the others to escape, it destroys their lives too, as his subconscious simply doesn't like other people being happy either; Kryten's mop breaks, the Cat's Valkyries rebel as the milk curdles, and Lister's family leave him as the town is basically destroyed.</li><li> Cyberia is essentially the opposite.

They certainly seem to be sapient enough (for instance, in the second book a group of them are found hanging out playing a game of poker), but they tend to get destroyed with reckless abandon. In the first book, the two Rimmers overwork eighty or so of them to the point that they explode, and nobody seems to view this with anything more than annoyance; in the second, a further 40 are crushed to death while testing the engine pistons, and the worst reaction anyone has to this is Rimmer cursing his own idiocy and realising that they will be unable to restart the engine before the ship is destroyed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldRatherSuffer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldRatherSuffer">Would Rather Suffer</a>: Lister is initially so against the idea of not going into stasis that he claims he'd rather drink a pint of his own diarrhea than hang around Rimmer - or a pint of someone else's, every hour, on the hour, for the next fifty years.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Mimas.
