This is shown to have negative results when a family that can't afford to buy a husband then has no children and no one to pass their property on to after they die. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Averted at the end when the Whistlers secretly adopt Eldie Porter, to prevent her being executed for the crimes of her mother.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">Aerith and Bob</a>: Here are the names of the Whistler children&mdash;there are a total of twenty-eight girls/women and four boys&mdash;given in order of mention: Jerin, Corelle, Eldest, Pansy, Violet, Kai, Doric, Leia, Blush, Summer, Eva, Kira, Heria, Liam, Emma, Celain, Kettie, Birdie, and Bunny.

Not long after, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoots a Porter woman to save Cira</span> and holds absolutely still for several minutes, overcome with reaction. Of course five or ten minutes later he is using the woman he killed as a dead weight to keep the whistle going to bleed steam out of the boilers.

They have a pact that whoever has sex first tells the other everything. Cullen is seen as harmless and kind of adorable, Jerin finds Lylia slightly threatening in an exciting way.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a>: The War of the False Eldest, which took place several generations ago is important for many reasons:<ul><li> It was during this war that the Whistlers went from a group of thieves and smugglers to a family of landed gentry, and stole themselves a secretly royal husband.</li><li> It establishes the ability of a big enough family to "split"&mdash;but also explains why the royal family in particular can't take this option anymore, and why a family thinking about splitting would be wise to have a second line of work for the new branch to take on.</li><li> The aftermath of the war set a major precedent for the extermination of rebel houses down to the very last child, nobility or not.</li><li> An opera about this conflict also becomes an important part of the backstory in and of itself.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a>: Eldest Moorland is willing to accept a "Brother's Price" less than half of what her sibling Cullen is worth simply because his happiness means more to her than the money.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredWithScars">Covered with Scars</a>: Cira only has one on her face, but they're all over her back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>: The main characters are shielded from the worst of it, but oh boy. First, if you're a man, you're property, period. The best you can hope for is that your wives treat you well, and you may well wind up in a crib, where you'll be drugged to incoherence and studded out, probably catching a disease somewhere along the way. If you're a woman, things can still be very far from awesome, given ubiquitousness of poverty and high levels of social stratification, whole families are held to account for the actions of a single member, and if you're orphaned, God help you, because no one else will, seeing how adoption is outlawed by their religion (explained by one character as "it encourages the idiots to overproduce in vain hopes of a boy"). The same religion holds that the ruling dynasty is descended from the gods, by the way. The place appears to be an absolute monarchy (the princesses all seem decent enough, but still), has a thriving thieves' guild, and is so badly run that a bunch of masked women known only as "the Hats" can drum up enough support among the River Trash for overthrowing the government to be considered a legitimate option.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossdressingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossdressingVoices">Crossdressing Voices</a>: In-universe.

Jerin is terrified of this fate, knowing that his family's economic future rides on the "brother's price" they'll get from him; if he is raped, then in order to pay off their debts, they'll have to sell him to a crib, where he'll be numbered and drugged and forced to service women night after night.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>:<ul><li> The men-as-property and polygamy aspects aside, the whole family is usually held accountable for the actions of one member so that a family can't simply commit treason and then sacrifice one person, becoming more willing to repeat the offense as revenge.

When a man is married into a family, he marries <em>all</em> of the sisters, regardless of age&mdash;including children and any unborn or yet-to-be-conceived daughters of the mothers.

This is most likely intentional, as it is a gender-swapped setting, and it is lampshaded that boys are raised to be unable to say "no" to women, but at the same time expected to be chaste. To her credit, Ren does some of the lampshading, and acknowledges that she probably sounds like a hypocrite for telling her victim that he should be allowed to say no.

He dislikes her as a person, is already in love with at least one of the princesses, is in a culture that strongly disapproves of such contact between a man and a woman who are not married to each other, and is embarrassed by the public setting. Entitled much, Kij?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">Kissing Cousins</a>: Spoilery example aside, Ren and Jerin share great-great-grandmothers, making them third cousins. There's also mention of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticeKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticeKiss">Practice Kiss</a> having been tried between cousins Lylia and Cullen. It is later made clear that cousin marriages are acceptable as long as the biological relationship is no closer than first half-cousins.

Noble or royal blood through the father gives status (most of the Queensland nobility became so by marrying a royal prince) but land and titles descend only through the female. In addition, birth certificates list the child's pedigree for generations, but solely following the maternal line.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>: There are the Whistlers, a family with more than thirty children. Most of them appear in the plot. There's Jerin, Corelle, Kai, Alaric, Blush, Summer, Eldest, and a bunch of toddlers, all named. Then there are the princesses: Rensellaer, Odelia, Trini, Lylia and Halley, and their five younger sisters. And that's only two families. The Whistlers have a family branch that lives in Annaboro, and has lots of members, too.

What exactly it does is left unclear, though the implied "last longer" effect can not be the only one; most likely it's a kind of powerful aphrodisiac, as a woman having one in her possession is viewed as intending to rape a man.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit">Lysistrata Gambit</a>: Keifer often withheld sex in conjunction with throwing raging fits in order to get his wives to go along with whatever he wanted.

Jerin is terrified of the prospect of having to "service" the thirty less-than-desirable Brindle women.</li><li> Cuts both ways&mdash;Keifer, the first husband of the princesses attacked and raped and tortured Trini, but convinced her older sister that "she provoked him", and got off with no punishment at all. When he dies sometime after the incident, he is not missed.<ul><li> Some double standards exist; Trini raping him wouldn't have been seen as so easily forgivable, but if Keifer had raped some random woman all he would be punished for is adultery.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryForLove">Marry for Love</a>: what Jerin really wants is to marry into a family he'll love instead of simply enduring. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He gets his wish, falling in love with all the princesses.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarryThemAll">Marry Them All</a>: Luckily for Jerin, all of the women to whom he's attracted <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turn out to be the royal princesses</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasculineGirlFeminineBoy">Masculine Girl, Feminine Boy</a>: Somewhat, by our standards. More attention is paid to beautifying males, who have long flowing hair and do domestic things. Jerin is actually somewhat feminine by <em>their</em> standards, since he was taught to do things men usually don't learn.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassiveNumberedSiblings">Massive Numbered Siblings</a>: Jerin has twenty-eight sisters and three brothers. Then again, they were born to twelve mothers. Families with decent male birthrates (or a lot of money to buy more husbands) can split occasionally to work against this, but for a family like the Brindles (thirty women and only one brother), it will only get worse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMatchMadeInStockholm">A Match Made in Stockholm</a>: Jerin's grandfather was abducted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matriarchy">Matriarchy</a>: A variant of the "gender-flip of patriarchy," complicated by the change in male:female ratio.<ul><li> As men are only about three to five percent of the adult population, and are regarded as more delicate and fragile than women, mostly relegated to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband">House Husband</a> duties. Women are far more collective than they would be in a simple patriarchy flip.

In fact dividing a family's numerous daughters into "eldest", "middle" and "youngest" cadres seems to be standard practice in Queensland. Since family authority goes strictly by seniority you can imagine how much this must suck for assertive younger sisters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissingMom">Missing Moms</a>: The Whistler mothers are elsewhere for a good chunk of the book, though they do come back.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherhoodIsSuperior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherhoodIsSuperior">Motherhood Is Superior</a>: Inverted, as it is men's responsibility to care for the children... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderRarityValue">if</a> there is a man in the family. Also, it is expected of teenage brothers to care for their baby sisters, and the failure to do so <em>is</em> noticed by potential wives: when Balin Brindle leaves it to his frail old father to care for the babies, Summer Whistler does <em>not</em> approve. She understandably wants to marry a man who is good with children.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneLuxury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneLuxury">Mundane Luxury</a>: Jerrin revels in simply getting to sit down and eat a meal without having to prepare it himself first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking">My Biological Clock Is Ticking</a>: Sort of. Eldest Whistler, twenty-eight years old, would like to have one child before menopause. Having seen her mothers pregnant she's aware that sometimes they seem miserable, other times they almost glow, and she wants to experience it once. After that, she laughingly tells Jerin, she'll be happy to let her sisters bear the children.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>: When confronted by Jerin and Cira at the end of the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kij</span> claims that all of her own and her family's misdeeds&mdash;which at latest count include treason, murder and attempted murder (including members of <em>her own family</em>), piracy, kidnapping, and smuggling&mdash;are actually the fault of the royal family, because the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Porters</span> lost money and property in the War of the False Eldest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">Never Say "Die"</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a> then Subverted.

Better yet, this basically foils the attackers' plan of weakening the royal family by ultimately leaving the two most competent princesses (after their older sisters were implied cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouDumb">Love Makes You Dumb</a>) as the eldest. Better <em>yet</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Keifer was actually the part of the enemies' party and was supposed to survive. His stupidity killed him, the Porters' Eldest, the princesses who sympathized with the Porters, and ultimately his family's influence at the court.

When Ren comes to her with legitimate arguments in favor, nothing at all seems to sway her until Ren offhandedly mentions <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Porters have offered for Jerin.</span> Immediately, Trini stops arguing and agrees with the marriage on the spot at least partly to spite the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Porters.</span> Had they not offered for Jerin, there was a good chance that Trini would've stayed against the marriage long enough to prevent it through sheer stubbornness. Making this even more entertaining, neither the villains nor Ren ever seem to notice how they practically handed Ren Trini's vote on a silver platter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain">Never Be Hurt Again</a>: Trini's reluctance to marry again <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is due to a prior man's abuse</span>.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">No Name Given</a>: The late father of the princesses presumably had a name, but we never hear it.

And is Rensellaer pronounced with an umlaut for the ae, or is it pronounced Rennsell-a-er? And one really hopes that poor Cullen is not pronounced like the vampire family of the same name. There's also the question whether Tullen rhymes with Cullen, or not. It should, but if it's English, that's not a given.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eldie Porter's parents</span> &mdash; not that that makes it okay in-universe, just not <em>so</em> bad as it might have been.

A one point the "not young anymore" (by Ren's words) Kij Porter, presumably in her late 30s, makes advances to a not-quite-yet-16 Jerin. He's creeped, though probably more because he's scared of her as a person. Cullen Moorland on the other hand clearly welcomes Eldest Whistler's advances and she's 28 to his 16.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: Averted. Because the firstborn daughter of any family is given the title/name "Eldest", there are a lot of Eldests around. However, non-family members usually call the Eldest of some other family <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastNameBasis">by her last name</a>. Technically there are three Eldest Whistlers shown, but Jerin only calls one of them by that name - the others he calls Mother Eldest and Cousin Eldest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentChildIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentChildIncest">Parent&#150;Child Incest</a>: Suspected to occur among the Brindles. We would think of it more as "Aunt-Nephew Incest", but it's considered parent-child in this world.

He stresses that he really really wanted it, was enthusiastic when he realized that otherwise his only intimacy might be with the Brindles, and was quick to protest that Ren stopped when he said no after Eldest Whistler called it rape... but before he gave in he was babbling uncomfortably and looking for excuses to leave while she touched him. Basically his heart was saying "Yes, yes, yes" and his mind was saying "No, no, no" fatally complicating the issue of consent.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuittingToGetMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuittingToGetMarried">Quitting to Get Married</a>: Jerin meets his old teacher, Miss Skinner, on a ship. She is getting married, and quitting her job.

Due to the scarcity of males, however, some families have no resident "father." Children of such households would necessarily be raised by the less-nurturing gender&mdash;that is, women&mdash;and might be expected to lack some of the finer social skills of their "properly" reared counterparts.

For this purpose, they conspire to get the young man in the playroom with their toddler sisters, and have the reluctant sister walk by, so that she can witness how kind and patient he is with the kids. While she is impressed, she isn't convinced, as, to her, the secret test is not secret enough&mdash;he could be faking it in order to get to marry them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentIntoHiding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SentIntoHiding">Sent Into Hiding</a>: Alannon was kept secret by the grandmothers ... he was a prince, although not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Hidden Backup Prince</a> (he was not heir to the throne), and their kidnapping him from a palace under siege was not entirely legal.

A boy can feel lucky if his father is still around when he reaches adulthood, and a man will be considered handsome if he has both eyes and all of his teeth. Families consist of a group of sisters, the husband they married, and children. Children within a family can have up to thirty girls with only one boy. A family with four boys and twenty-eight girls is considered uncommonly lucky.

Jerin and his family saved the Princess Odelia, and the end of the book has him marrying the princesses. Really it's more complex than that; the Princess Ren persuaded her Mother Elder to sponsor the Whistlers to come to the royal court, and a lot of time and effort is spent trying to bring Jerin's sisters and Ren's family to agree to the marriage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt">Not So Standard Royal Court</a>: Queensland has the royal family, royal retainers, royal guard, and scheming nobles of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt">Standard Royal Court</a> but with a twist; all these roles from Queens down are played by cadres of up to twenty sisters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>: There was one in the form of the War of the False Eldest which the effects of are still felt after two generations</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity">STD Immunity</a>: So thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a> that it has a major cultural impact.

Since a man marries every sister in a family and is expected to service any of them who are of age, a single member of that group with an STD will pass it on to all of them, which in several cases has led to that family dying out. Fear of venereal disease has really affected the culture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming">Theme Naming</a>: Of a sort. The firstborn female of any family is always named Eldest. The Whistlers have the Mother Elder, the oldest of the mothers, and Eldest Whistler, the eldest of their daughters. A batch of experimental prototype cannons which were stolen before the book starts, which have a major subplot devoted to them, are called the Prophets and have names derived from the in-universe mythology: Joan, Bonnye, Anna, Judith, Gregor, Larisa, Nane, and Ami.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">Thicker Than Water</a>: The expected societal norm. (Which didn't stop the royal family from executing their own in the eponymous Cousin war, but royalty is always a special case) Corelle Whistler constantly tells her brother Jerin that his clothes are not nice enough, his accent is too posh, and his hands are too rough, but if he's under attack from outsiders, she'll come to his rescue instantly. His eldest sister tells him at one point that he's a Whistler, and need not be worried about anything, because his family will always be there for him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>: While his sisters kill when necessary they never do it if Jerrin is present.

And even then, the protagonists don't like the thought of small children being executed for their mothers' crimes (as is the normal course of action, to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">revenge being taken by the surviving offspring.</a>)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>: The tituler Brother's price is essentially a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_price">bride price<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.
