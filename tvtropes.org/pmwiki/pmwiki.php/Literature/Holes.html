It's about teenager <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithPalindromes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithPalindromes">Stanley Yelnats</a>, who is arrested for a crime he didn't commit and sent to a juvenile detention center called "Camp Green Lake". At the camp, the boys are mistreated by the suspicious owners, who force them to continually dig holes in the middle of a desert with the same width and depth. And there are curses. And thumbs. And a story from the past about a romance destroyed by bigotry.</p><p>Not so depressing or angsty as the premise makes it seem, but still a bit "adult" for a kids' book, hence its success. The narrative includes two other timelines in addition to Stanley's that appear to be almost irrelevant to each other, until the resolution when they all come together.</p><p>In 2003, it was made into a fairly faithful film by Walt Disney Pictures; the script was also written by Sachar. It was directed by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndrewDavis">Andrew Davis</a> (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFugitive">The Fugitive</a></em> fame) and stars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> as Stanley, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SigourneyWeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SigourneyWeaver">Sigourney Weaver</a> as the Warden, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonVoight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonVoight">Jon Voight</a> as Mr. Sir and a good deal of other notable actors in bit parts. Like the book, the film is well-regarded among both fans of Sachar's work and the broader public, to the point where it still maintains a reputation as one of the best literary adaptations of the modern era.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Sachar wrote a sequel called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallSteps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallSteps">Small Steps</a></em> which follows Theodore ("Armpit") and X-Ray after their release from Camp Green Lake.</p><p>He also wrote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StanleyYelnatsSurvivalGuideToCampGreenLake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StanleyYelnatsSurvivalGuideToCampGreenLake">a guide to surviving Camp Green Lake</a>, narrated by Stanley.</p><p></p><hr><h2>This book provides examples of:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>: Charles "Trout" Walker was this to his children and grandchildren, forcing them to dig everyday in the dried lake bed for Kissin' Kate's loot. He wouldn't even let them take a break on their birthdays or on holidays. This treatment is what led to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Warden (Trout's granddaughter)</span> becoming such a bitter and cynical person.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>: When Sam offers to fix the schoolhouse, Kate jokingly says he can't fill the holes in the roof with onion paste. In the book Sam laughs out loud and in the movie he gives her an appreciative smile before explaining he's a handyman as well as an onion seller.</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddictionDisplacement">Addiction Displacement</a>: Mr. Sir is constantly snacking on sunflower seeds in an effort to give up smoking. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of the book he lapses back into smoking again.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a>: In the book, Stanley is fat; his nickname, Caveman, is derived from his being a big guy. In the movie he's played by a young and skinny <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a>. They call him "Caveman" because he found a fossil, and the other boys said he belongs in a cave. The film-makers explain that it would've been very difficult to try and film a fat 14-year-old actor gradually losing a lot of weight, which happens in the book due to all the strenuous hole-digging. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> also mentioned in an interview that he tried "gobbling down Twinkies" in order to gain the weight, but Sachar himself told him that it was more important that he focus on depicting the character's diffidence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">Adaptation Distillation</a>:<ul><li> Sam's death is pretty much the same in both versions, but in the book, Katherine finds Sam before the townspeople do and warns him of the mob. They try to escape together, but Trout's boat catches up to them, and Sam is killed while Katherine is dragged away against her will. In the film, she fails to get to him and witnesses Sam's death from the shoreline.</li><li> In the book, a local townswoman witnessed Sam kissing Katherine and spread the word. In the film, it's Trout who sees them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationExpansion">Adaptation Expansion</a>:<ul><li> The film includes a scene after Stanley and Zero run away where the other D-Tent members discuss whether they could still be alive.</li><li> The fate of Mr. Sir: in the book, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he just returns Stanley's belongings to him at the end</span>; in the film, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's revealed to be a paroled ex-convict named Marion Savillo and gets arrested again for carrying a gun</span>.</li><li> At the end of the film, we see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the other members of "D" tent at Stanley's house party, hanging out with him.</span> No such thing happens, or is even mentioned, in the book.</li><li> In the book, the yellow-spotted lizard that killed Kate Barlow showed up out of nowhere and bit her on its own free will. In the film, she grabbed it and made it bite her.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationInducedPlotHole">Adaptation-Induced Plot Hole</a>: Inverted. The screenplay having been written by the original author, the film has some minor fixes to cover up plot holes in the book.<ul><li> In the book it's never explained how X-Ray tells apart his special shovel from anyone else's, since his eyesight isn't very good and Stanley thinks it's no shorter than any of the others. In the film, it has a orange stripe painted on it unlike all the other shovels.</li><li> In the book Stanley finds his way back to the hole where he found the lipstick tube, but it's not clear how he found it in the dark of night amidst so many other holes. In the film he finds a large rock inside the hole, and puts it by the dirt pile to mark it for later.</li><li> One example that plays this straight is when Armpit asks Stanley to contact his mother at the end of the movie and tell her he's sorry. In the book this was Squid, who also had several more scenes in the original story showing that he was clearly suffering from some parental issues. Even more bizarre is that there is a scene where Squid teases Stanley about writing to his own mother earlier in the film and then goes on to say in a cold tone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">that his parents don't care about him</a>, which makes it seem like the movie will follow the original book subplot but is instead never addressed again.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalNiceGuy">Adaptational Nice Guy</a>: X-Ray in the book doesn't welcome Stanley and Hector back from the desert. In the film, he hugs them in relief on seeing that they're alive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgonyOfTheFeet">Agony of the Feet</a>: Barfbag manages to get out of Camp Green Lake before Stanley's arrival (his departure leaves a vacancy which Stanley fills) by taking off one shoe and sock and tempting a rattlesnake to bite his foot. Can't blame him for screaming (we see this at the start of the film; we only hear this from Zero in the book).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">The Alcatraz</a>: There's nothing stopping a kid from escaping from Camp Green Lake, but the escapee will end up dying of dehydration, seeing as the camp is in the middle of nowhere. A very arid middle of nowhere.<div class="indent"> <strong>Mr. Sir:</strong> You see any barbed wire fences? Any guard towers? No? That's because we don't need 'em. Go ahead, start running away. I won't stop you&#133; You wanna run away, them buzzards'll pick you clean by the end of the third day.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>: Green Lake's sheriff, as when Kate goes to him for help, he's drunk on the job and asks her for a kiss. Before Kate shoots him, he's drinking a cup of coffee, possibly due to a hangover.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">All for Nothing</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the whole purpose of Camp Green Lake is to use the boys to find the treasure faster than if the Warden was doing it herself, as she had done through her childhood thanks to Trout, her abusive grandfather. Stanley finds the treasure chest, finds that it rightfully belongs to his family, and the Warden is left with nothing to show for her efforts, as Stanley refuses to let her look inside it, so all the effort she put into finding the treasure went completely to waste.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlliterativeName">Alliterative Name</a>: Myra Menke, and her father Morris Menke. Also the bully who picked on Stanley in school, Derrick Dunne, only in the book and in one of the film's deleted scenes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyJewish">Ambiguously Jewish</a>: The Yelnats family. At least in the book. The movie makes it more explicit, with the grandfather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage">dropping the occasional Yiddish</a>. In fact, "Elya" is Louis Sacher's Hebrew name.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSyntax">Ambiguous Syntax</a>: When Stanley and Zero are stuck in a hole, covered with yellow-spotted lizards, and the camp staff are wondering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyIsntItAttacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyIsntItAttacking">why the lizards aren't biting</a>, someone suggests shooting them. Immediate response: "The lizards or the kids?"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>: Zero whacking Pendanski across the face with a shovel. Also, in the film, Mr Sir falls into a hole when Stanley steals the water truck. At the end, when Pendanski goes back to the mess hall <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to tell the boys they won't have to dig anymore holes if they keep quiet</span>, he falls into a hole too.<ul><li> Averted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kissin' Kate Barlow allows herself to be bitten by a yellow-spotted lizard to save her from a worse fate than she would receive from the Walkers.</span>, and when the Warden slashes Mr Sir across the face with her fingernails.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronicOrder">Anachronic Order</a>: In between parts of Stanley's story, it occasionally jumps back in time to tell the stories of Elya Yelnats and Kissin' Kate Barlow.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndStarring">And Starring</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShiaLaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a> gets an "And Introducing" credit. Which is a bit of a cheat: Though this was his first feature film, he was well-known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvenStevens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EvenStevens">Louis Stevens</a> at the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo">And Your Little Dog, Too!</a>: After Trout Walker <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had killed Sam</span>, Miss Katherine found out the town <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">had also killed Sam's beloved donkey Mary Lou</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppropriatedAppellation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppropriatedAppellation">Appropriated Appellation</a>: How the boys get their nicknames.

When the pigs each man brings is of equal weight, Myra ends up being the one who has to decide between them and she just gets confused.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactTitle">Artifact Title</a>: In-universe. Camp Green Lake once used to be a lush lake with a thriving town, but the town dried up with the lake, leaving only a barren wasteland.

Pendanski insults Zero one time too many by giving him a shovel and saying it will be all he will ever be good for. Having reached his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageBreakingPoint">Rage Breaking Point</a>, Zero knocks Pendanski cold by whacking him across the face with the shovel.</li><li> The denizens of Green Lake are on the receiving end of this when they brutally murder Sam. A drought hits the lake and it all dries up. The narration even states that all this can be seen as divine punishment.</li><li> "Trout" Walker was one of the people to lead and spearhead the town's mob against Katherine and Sam. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichesToRags" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichesToRags">winds up broke</a> during the drought and spends the rest of his days digging for a treasure and never finding it.</li><li> A positive example: Stanley teaching Zero how to read prevents him from getting cheated out of the money that belongs to his family.

The book tells us that it was actually that his great-great-grandfather had been given a pig by an old Egyptian woman missing a foot&mdash;who was also a friend of his. He was supposed to carry her up a mountain and let her drink from a stream. However, he failed to do this and he and his descendants would be cursed with bad luck forever.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>: The film in comparison to the book. Especially at the end.<ul><li> Not that much in the overall film, though. Several of the darker scenes are also in the DVD. For example, in the film and book, Kissin' Kate Barlow goes through a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> and the killings are completely random.</li><li> The film script was originally written by Richard Kelly, the man who wrote and directed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DonnieDarko">Donnie Darko</a></em>, and it was very radically different from the book to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>. Luckily the studio decided to change writers and go for a much lighter and more faithful script.

Stanley Yelnats dismisses his family's story of his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather, so he doesn't understand the significance behind Zero's last name being Zeroni (Madame Zeroni cursed said great-great-grandfather for failing to uphold his end of a promise). And while he knows that the bullet shell with the KB monogram that he found belonged to famed outlaw Kissin' Kate Barlow and that they were digging for <em>something</em> in the Texas desert, he doesn't realize why finding the bullet shell was important, though he does make it a point to remember where it was initially found. He eventually sings to Zero as he drinks from a mountain pool, inadvertently breaking the curse on his family, and he and Zero return to where the bullet shell was found to dig a little further, where they discover the shell was a marker for the location of Barlow's rumored treasure hoard.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicRealism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicRealism">Magic Realism</a>: If you take the Yelnats family curse to be real, and/or the drought on Green Lake to be literal divine retribution, rather than just a series of <em>extremely</em> unlikely coincidences, then the whole story falls into this. It's a mostly-realistic story of prejudice, poverty, the inadequacies of the US penal system... and a <em>very</em> persistent curse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a>: All over the place. Technically, there is nothing in the book that couldn't happen in real life (except the yellow-spotted lizards, which don't exist) &mdash; but a lot of it would take some pretty insane coincidences and instances of bad luck for it to happen the way it did. Or maybe there's something supernatural involved after all. It's ultimately up to you.<ul><li> In the scene with Kate where she's trudging along lonely in the desert, Sam appearing to her could just be a hallucination, or it <em>could</em> be his spirit actually coming to help her cross over. Viewers are free to interpret it as they choose. One strong argument for it to be an actual ghost is when Trout and his wife approach with the goal of forcing Kate to tell them where she buried her treasure, there's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it instant where Sam sees and reacts to them before Kate even realizes they're present, not to mention that Stanley saw both Sam and Mary Lou during his drive to the camp as they faded away.</li><li> The whole plot about the curse on Stanley's family also fits this: there's no definitive proof that Madame Zeroni had magical powers and could curse Elya, and the Yelnats family could have simply had spectacularly bad luck by coincidence up until Stanley carried Hector up the mountain.</li><li> The sudden catastrophic drought Green Lake suffered from may itself have been bad luck, but there are some hints it may very well have been God Himself punishing the people for murdering Sam.</li><li> There's even a line in the book acknowledging this, and how it ultimately doesn't change the story too much no matter what interpretation you take.<div class="indent"><em>A lot of people don't believe in curses.

Once Stanley and Zero find Kissin' Kate's treasure and Stanley's family attorneys show up to rescue him, Stanley is able to convince the attorney to bring Zero with them, in part because a lack of record means that, in the eyes of the law, Zero was never supposed to be at the camp to begin with, which lands the Warden, Mr. Sir, and Mr. Pendanski in even more hot water.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoahsStoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoahsStoryArc">"Noah's Story" Arc</a>: Joked about.

The reader knows that's not Stanley's intention and Zero was the one to suggest the deal of digging part of Stanley's hole. The other boys don't. Sadder still, they only learn the truth once Stanley and Zero are confronted by the Warden and Mr. Sir, whom <em>they</em> tell what's been going on. The narrative also briefly mentions that the camp does not have a disproportionate amount of campers of one skin color over another, dissuading the possibility of racial profiling (at least on the camp's part) and implying that the boys are there for at least committing <em>a</em> crime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">Obliviously Evil</a>: Downplayed. At the start of the book, it's stated that some of Stanley's teachers make cruel comments and embarrass their students without realising it, as demonstrated by his math teacher, who embarrasses him and another boy by weighing them (Stanley is the heaviest kid in the class, the other kid is the lightest, and unfortunately, Stanley is three times heavier than him) while teaching ratios and writing the result on the board.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>:<ul><li> The sheriff in the film gets one when Kate pulls a gun on him, right before she kills him.</li><li> Magnet gets one when he sees the water truck, driven by Mr. Sir, coming back, realising his sack of sunflower seeds is missing (Magnet stole it minutes earlier).

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallSteps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallSteps">Small Steps</a></em>, we even get two of their surnames: Johnson for Armpit, and Washburn for X-Ray. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Subverted by Mr Sir in the film, too: his real name turns out to be Marion Sevillo.

In particular, Armpit never likes to be referred to by his real name of Theodore. At the end, Armpit asks Stanley to call his mother and apologize on his behalf, saying, "Tell her Theodore said he was sorry." This is changed from the book, as it's Squid, not Armpit, who asks Stanley this favour ("Tell her Alan said he was sorry"), but it's still played straight, as the boys refer to each other by their nicknames rather than their actual names, except for Stanley before he acquires his nickname of Caveman.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaGambit">Paranoia Gambit</a>: After Stanley has learned to no longer expect water from the vengeful Mr. Sir, Mr. Sir surprises him by refilling his canteen. But then he takes it to his car and gives it back a minute later, still full. Then he waits for Stanley to drink from it. When he's so thirsty he can no longer bear it, Stanley pours the entire contents of the canteen, refusing to drink from it thanks to his suspicion.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PartingWordsRegret">Parting Words Regret</a>: In the film, all of the boys get worried when Stanley drives Mr. Sir's truck into the desert and then runs on foot to find Zero.

In the same scene she also demands that for (she thinks) finding the gold tube, X-Ray should not only get a day off but also double shower tokens and a snack.</li><li> When Pendanski finds Mr. Sir is depriving Stanley of water after the sunflower seeds incident, Pendanski gives Stanley extra water.

The minute Sam and Kate kiss, the townspeople find out; they raise a mob to burn down the schoolhouse because they don't value education, and the sheriff plans to hang Sam because it's against the law for a black man to kiss a white woman.
