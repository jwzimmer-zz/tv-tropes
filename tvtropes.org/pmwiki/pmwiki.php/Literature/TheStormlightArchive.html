Adaptations include grass that retreats into holes in the rock when threatened. Very few animals other than the humanoid races seem to even be <em>mammals</em> (there are minks and horses), with beasts of burden and domesticated pets being mostly crustacean, reptilian or insectile. The low gravity also allows for the massive crustacean greatshells to exist without being crushed under their own weight. Additionally, Greatshells are implied to gain sustenance from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">stormlight</a> that comes in on the Highstorms, using their massive internal gemstones to store it.</li><li> Plants are very tough and tend to grow in clefts of rock or behind ridges, or have some form of sensory apparatus that let them detect water and sense movement nearby so they can extend or retract parts of their bodies. Early on, Kaladin notes that farming is very different, as instead of plowing fields a farmer instead spreads a sap mixed with seeds across rocky hillsides, and then wait for polyps to grow that are filled with powdery grain. The only real work needed to maintain the crop is "worming" which involves making sure worm-like parasites don't tunnel into the polyp and eat all the grain.</li><li> The Parshendi race has shades of this. We know their bones are red, their skin is marbled multi-colored, their blood is orange and smells moldy, and they grow their armor as part of their bodies. It turns out that they're actually shapeshifters, and originally were capable of assuming hundreds of different forms, though many of those forms were as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Voidbringers</span>. And it's even implied in their legends that they may <em>literally</em> be aliens, though the stories are unclear.</li><li> Most species native to Roshar have gemhearts, natural organs made of precious gemstones. Chasm fiends, chulls, and Parshendi are all confirmed to have them by the end of <em>Oathbringer.</em> Most terrestrial species&mdash;we see humans, horses, pigs, and minks&mdash;lack a gemheart <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> because they didn't originate on Roshar</span>.</li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> when it comes to the country of Shinovar. Highstorms don't reach there, so the ecology of the region is a lot more similar to Earth, even to the point of having strawberries and chickens, and in <em>Edgedancer</em> Lift remarks that the region has something akin to goats living in the mountains. Visitors to this land from the rest of Roshar find it extremely strange. There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> where Eastern characters call every bird a chicken.</li><li> Even humans from Roshar have some odd quirks of their genetics compared to those from Earth. For example, hair and eye color inherit fractionally rather than through dominant/recessive combinations. Brown hair and blonde hair will make a kid with half brown, half blonde hair. The same is true for a darkeyes and lighteyes having children: They can have one light eye and one dark, though they might just be born either normal light or dark eyes.</li><li> As it turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> for the planet as a whole; humanity is an invasive species on Roshar, fleeing the destruction they inflicted on their original homeworld and settling in Shinovar, hence the Earth-like flora and fauna native to that country. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by the Stormfather, who points out that it should be obvious that humans were never made for a world like Roshar.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSeasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSeasons">Bizarre Seasons</a>: It's not terribly obvious, but the seasons appear in random order, and change every few weeks.

Women are the only ones allowed to be literate (with men being restricted to a simplified pictograph language), and most non-administrative white-collar jobs are restricted to women. The Shin have a perspective much closer to the reader's, written in a surreal and overly-specific style to highlight the alienness of the Alethi and their allies. Slavery is also for the most part accepted, although it is <em>supposed</em> to only be used as a punishment for crimes or debt.

Dalinar's visions imply that all current lighteyes are descended from the first darkeyes who stole the Blades left behind by the Knights Radiant when they disbanded, meaning it's all little more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> writ large.

Within the castes are also ranks ("nahn" for darkeyes and "dahn" for lighteyes), earned via a meritocracy, and denotes rights such as land ownership and ability to marry into a higher caste.

Clear goblets are filled with spheres and used as lamps; "wasting" spheres on light is something of a status symbol.

Different gems used include diamond (the lowest), garnet, zircon, sapphire, ruby, and emerald (the highest). One emerald broam (the highest possible denomination) is worth one thousand diamond chips (the lowest possible denomination), and the system seems to be based on multiples of five.

Any invasion needs to be quick, brutal, and violent, often with Shardbearers to break the defenses. In addition, cities are often built in such a way to shelter them from the constant devastating effects of highstorms, putting them in sub-optimal defensive positions as a result.

While an effective strategy, the siege causes massive strain on Alethkar itself, costs a tremendous number of lives, and eventually pushes the Parshendi to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> develop stormform bodies, which triggers their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>, starts up a new Everstorm, and begins the next Desolation</span>.</li><li> Alethi cities are often built to defend first against highstorms and then secondly against sieges, since the highstorms will often blow away any attempt at a prolonged siege. For this reason, the Alethi tend to avoid sieges where they can, instead aggressively assaulting the walls. The city of Kholinar itself takes this a step further; ''everything' within a day's march of the city itself is cleared out, leaving only open fields with no buildings or hills or anything else than can shield an invading army, making it much, much harder to set up an effective siege of the city.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulCuttingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulCuttingBlade">Soul-Cutting Blade</a>: Shardblades.

Same here: The whole book builds up to this part, but in this case, a lot of these things have been set up since the beginning of <em>The Way of Kings</em>.</li><li> <em>Oathbringer</em>, Part 3: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkestHour">Kholinar is lost to Odium's forces</a>, Elhokar is killed, almost a dozen of named minor characters die, the heroes in Kholinar are involuntarily sent to Shadesmar - and Dalinar's memories of Evi's death return</span>.</li><li> Also <em>Oathbringer</em>, Part 5: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Szeth joins Dalinar, Dalinar takes a stand against Odium and opens Honor's Perpendicularity, the Radiants fight the Fused in Thaylen City, Urithitu is attacked, Teft speaks his third Oath, Amaram is killed (after being established as an antagonist in the <em>first book</em>), Nergaoul is captured, Jasnah made queen</span> - among other things.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseOldFolkFacade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseOldFolkFacade">Wise Old Folk Fa&ccedil;ade</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">God of Evil</a> Odium appears to Dalinar as a regal-looking old man with powdery white hair and a tidy beard, addresses him as "son", and chats with him about their duties and motives. The facade <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxAffablyEvil">falls away</a> when he reveals his true intention to drive Dalinar over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">make him his Champion</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a>: Unless you live in Shinovar, you have to contend with Highstorms, Shardbearers, brigands, hostile terrain, and huge monstrous fauna. Generally, you either die, get sold into slavery, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">man up and rise to the occasion</a>. Sometimes you get to do all three.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoundThatWillNotHeal">Wound That Will Not Heal</a>:<ul><li> At the start of the series Szeth notes that even with the regenerative powers granted by Stormlight a limb rendered unusable by a Shardblade won't recover. Although in the second book <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kaladin's</span> arm is killed by Szeth's blade, and it does recover. This is because Szeth's sword <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is actually an Honorblade, which gives Szeth weaker surgebinding than Kaladin has.</span></li><li> Kaladin's regenerative powers won't heal his slave brand, for reasons not yet made clear but that probably have to do with Stormlight healing you to your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResidualSelfImage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResidualSelfImage">image of yourself when healthy.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">You Kill It, You Bought It</a>: The ordinary way to obtain Shards. Whoever strikes the killing blow on a wielder gets to take the Shards for himself. This is more social convention than anything to do with the Shards - Kaladin refused to take up one he earned in combat, in his backstory, and someone else took it instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourNormalIsOurTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourNormalIsOurTaboo">Your Normal Is Our Taboo</a>:<ul><li> Mostly shows up with the people of Shin versus those from most other countries. For example, the Shin people value humility above all else (to the point that their trade negotiations consist of merchants <em>downplaying</em> the value of their goods rather than exaggerating them) and consider walking on or otherwise touching or damaging stone to be disrespectful. After travelling throughout the other lands, Shin viewpoint character Szeth reflects that it's rather hard to hold foreigners to these rules considering their lands don't have soil covering the bare rock.</li><li> The Horneaters have a caste system based on the order in which children are born, which defines their vocation. When Rock explains this to the other bridgemen (mostly from Alethi-related cultures), the oddest part to them is that the Horneaters do not consider being a warrior to be the highest and most respected vocation. Rock also stuns the others by saying that Horneaters consider long-ranged weapons better and more honorable (whereas among Alethi, there's a reason the officers get swords and the grunts get spears).</li><li> Crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>, but this is also true of the general culture we see with the Alethi and related peoples compared to the <em>readers</em>. For example, how literacy is restricted to women.</li></ul></li></ul><hr>
