However, Harry sees a false eye on Dolores Umbridge's office door that resembles Moody's, and suspects she found and stole it. He thus steals it back and buries it in the forest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a><ul><li> Doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookEnds">Book-Ends</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone">Philosopher's Stone</a></em>, Hagrid takes Harry to 4 Privet Drive for the first time... in Sirius Black's flying motorbike. Guess how Harry leaves forever at the beginning of this book.</li><li> There are many references throughout <em>Deathly Hallows</em> calling back scenes from many of the other books. Some examples are Harry reminiscing with Hagrid about how Hagrid told him he was a wizard way back in <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>. Another is Ron taking Hermione to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> in search of Basilisk fangs to destroy the Hufflepuff cup Horcrux.</li><li> As Moody explains the escape plan from 4 Privet Drive, he addresses Fred, who proclaims to be George like he did way back in the first book to his mother. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Understatement">Moody tolerates it rather less than Molly.</a><div class="indent">"I&#146;m George," said the twin at whom Moody was pointing.

They call Harry out on this, noting that many school-aged kids they capture say this, but Harry describes where the entrance is and how it looks. This was only possible because he and Ron had been there in the second book disguised as Crabbe and Goyle.</li><li> Much like at the beginning of <em>Philosopher's Stone</em>, Hagrid is the one that carries Harry in his arms after he is hit (but not killed) by the Avada Kedavra curse.</li><li> The last two spells Harry and Voldemort use against each other are the same spells they used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">three years before</a>. Naturally, the result is markedly different.</li><li> In the epilogue, James has come back, telling how he saw Teddy and Victoire kissing and asking them what they are doing. Ginny chides him for interrupting them, then commenting "You are so like Ron." That comment was in reference to the birthday kiss Ginny gave Harry early in the book where Ron intruded into the room interrupting them.<ul><li> Back in the first book, Ginny complained about not being able to go to Hogwarts that year. In the epilogue, Ginny has that conversation with her daughter, but from the other side.</li></ul></li><li> The trio arrives at the Whomping Willow, with Ron noting they won't be able to get through as Crookshanks isn't there to deactivate it (which happened in the third book) by hitting a certain knot. Hermione then gives him a six-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">Ironic Echo</a>: "Are you a wizard, or what?" Ron then uses a Levitating Charm to ram a twig into the knot.</li><li> In "Goblet of Fire" the trio have discussion about Percy and the house elves, saying "Percy wouldn't want to work for anybody with a sense of humor" and "wouldn't recognize a joke if it danced in front of him wearing Dobby's tea cozy." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The one time Percy does joke, in this book, is when he turns Pius Thicknesse into a sea urchin and says he's resigning.</span></li><li> Near the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheOrderOfThePhoenix">the fifth book</a>, Harry discusses with Nearly Headless Nick regarding where the soul of a wizard/witch goes after their own physical body dies, with Nick informing Harry that wizards who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie">Not Afraid to Die</a> will have "gone on" instead of lingering in the physical world as ghosts as he has done and being unable to answer Harry when he asks "What do you mean, "gone on"?" The issue is touched on again in this book, albeit with a different dead wizard in the center of the discussion, this time with Ron asking Harry the same question Harry asked Nick with and receiving the same response Harry got from Nick.</li><li> Also from the fifth book, Bellatrix had criticised Harry's use of the Cruciatus Curse against her, saying that it wasn't effective because he didn't really want to cause his victim pain. After suitable provacation, he uses it again in this book, this time doing it correctly, and remarks that Bellatrix was right.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry">The Cavalry</a>: Brought by <em>Slughorn</em>, of all people.
