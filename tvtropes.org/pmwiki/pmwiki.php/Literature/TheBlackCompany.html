The series is notable for its unusual choice of protagonists in a fantasy setting: being a group of mercenaries, the Black Company does not turn down potential employers, and it prides itself on its sense of professional honour.</p><p>The series begins as the Company reluctantly accepts the commission of a northern sorceress tyrant known as "the Lady". A prophecy concerned with her downfall is about to be fulfilled, and the people are rising up in anticipation of the event. The Company has often been betrayed in the past by its employers, and the Lady is one of the least trustworthy ones it's had, but she pays well, and the Black Company goes where it is desired, so it commits to the contract.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>As time goes by, the Company struggles to survive and recover its past as it goes from employer to employer, drifts from conflict to conflict, and sees its fortunes wax and wane.

The verisimilitude is held to be very high, with the mercenaries being very frankly portrayed, rarely heroic and occasionally unsympathetic.

Probably due to the True Name being the universal lynchpin of all wizards' powers in series, therefore all wizards go to great pains to make sure theirs is hidden, such as wiping out everyone from their town who was alive when they were born (or worse). The Lady's true name was probably long buried by the time he married her.</li><li> After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Lady loses her powers, all her Taken</span> immediately die; however, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dominator's soul gets sealed in the Silver Spike and it is acknowledged by characters that he can no longer project his will onto the world, the old Taken (created by Dominator)</span> continue functioning perfectly. Lady mentions that she specifically set up the spell controlling her Taken so that if she died or lost her powers, they would too. The Dominator apparently did not include that clause in his.</li><li> Even though Lady knows the True Names of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Howler, Shapeshifter and Soulcatcher</span>, she never uses them, even though doing so would solve literally every single Company's problem. This problem gets acknowledged <em>once</em>, when she is still <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">de-powered</span> and Goblin says that she won't ever tell him or One-Eye True Names of their enemies. After she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">gets her powers back</span>... Well, she still does nothing. And gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sealed under the Glittering Plain, along with the majority of the Company</span> for her troubles. Made worse when you realize a lot more people than just Lady knew <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Soulcatcher</span>'s True Name and still did not use it. The Lady not using Soulcatcher's true name is explained much earlier in the series (they're bound by some sort of powerful sorcerous agreement to never use each other's names.) Why nobody else used it even though many major characters (including Croaker) discovered it in the process of researching the Lady's name is still not explained. The issue is that even if the Lady won't use Soulcatcher's true name against her, the Company <em>also</em> knows her name because of their research in <em>The White Rose.</em> Even if everyone forgot it, Croaker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterNarrator">wrote it in the Annals,</a> which Sleepy's narration in <em>Water Sleeps</em> makes clear that the Company is still in possession of.</li><li> The timeline between the Battle of Charm and the invasion of Taglios doesn't quite add up. The Battle of Charm happens a year or two after the start of the series. No more than fifteen years later (and possibly as few as twelve years later), the Shadowmasters are well-established and are repeatedly said to have ruled the Shadowlands for a "generation," despite the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stormbringer</span> was present (and faked her death) at the Battle of Charm, several thousand miles to the North, well under a generation earlier. Not all the Shadowmasters were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">former Taken</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Stormbringer</span> might well have joined them after they already were established.

Most of the narration is by Croaker, the Company's doctor and eventual leader. In later books the pen is held by the standard bearer, Murgen, his understudy Sleepy, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lady, the former tyrant</span>. All of them are, by their own admission, less than totally reliable (though the last one only admits that grudgingly).<ul><li> One of the first things Murgen does is poke fun at the massive amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotHole">Plot Hole</a> between Croaker and Lady's Annals, while giving some plausible reasons for the differences (Lady and Croaker have different distances put down between cities, and according to Lady, it's because they used different units of measurements. It's not because they can't count properly... nope.)</li><li> Sleepy seems to have a poor grasp of the timeline before the siege of Dejagore. Sleepy seems to think that Croaker was a twentysomething member of the rank-and-file of the Company who had only just become Annalist during the Company's time with the Syndic of Beryl. Croaker's own accounts in <em>The Black Company</em> imply (by omission of any of the uncertainty shown by Sleepy and Murgen) that he is well-established as Annalist, is in his mid-to-late thirties, is a Company specialist based on other skills (in this case, physician), and that he is an officer in everything but name. There's even a scene where the Captain reprimands Croaker for standing guard duty because any Company Brother can stand around keeping watch, but Croaker's medical skills are unique.</li><li> Used in-story, as well. Uncle Doj and Tobo have radically different versions of the history of Nyueng-Bao that agree on very little beyond their point of origin. Croaker and Lady don't find either one to be particularly authentic.</li><li> <em>Port of Shadows</em> has memory erasure play a significant role in its plot. We also see the Annalist being deliberately left out of the loop by the Captain because the Annals don't forget.</li><li> The Lady's True Name is...messy, to say the least. There were at least four Senjak sisters, of whom the Lady is one. The Dominator thinks (incorrectly) that she's Ardath. The ritual of naming in <em>The White Rose</em> demonstrates that she's Dorotea. <em>Port of Shadows</em> claims that Dorotea was killed by the Dominator and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a>, living into the present day as mentally unstable reanimated corpse. The same book claims that the woman it calls Creedence Senjak may in fact be the one who becomes the Lady. Lastly, it's mentioned at one point that Ardath and Dorotea switched names at some point, which may have been an <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Most of the time, they squabble and play various pranks on one another, however, they always pull together when the chips are down (even building an impromptu brewery when besieged in Dejagore). Murgen and Croaker both point out that Goblin and One-Eye have stopped feuding when they want to underscore just just how bad the situation is. In <em>She Is the Darkness,</em> Goblin even mentions that he misses One-Eye... but only when he's certain that no-one can hear him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">The Voiceless</a>: Silent, one of the Company's mages, is, well, silent.
