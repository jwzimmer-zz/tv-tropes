The minor officers in charge of securing the streets know that the best way to deal with the Treacle Mine Road barricade is to ignore it, and their verbal orders are to secure the streets by "any means necessary". Unfortunately their written down, official orders explicitly call for a full attack on all barricades and they can't pull the trick off.

A cart passes between them, and Vimes throws himself on the ground to keep Lu-Tze in sight under the cart because he suspects he's going to take the opportunity to leave. Lu-Tze doesn't. Then Vimes rushes across the road toward him &mdash; and nearly gets run down by another cart because he's too busy keeping Lu-Tze in sight to pay attention to the traffic.

Vimes repeatedly calls the Watch "just another gang" in his monologues. And he's explicitly told upfront that he cannot, <em>cannot</em> change any major events, such as a clearly pointless war borne of the Patrician's insanity which will last just long enough to kill many innocent people, or the deaths of many watchmen. However, rather than sitting there and taking it, he makes efforts to reform the watch, prevents a bloodbath on Morphic Street, and changes history by holding his barricade through the entire night when the original Keel failed halfway through, reducing his side's casualties to perhaps a dozen (during the battle, anyway).
