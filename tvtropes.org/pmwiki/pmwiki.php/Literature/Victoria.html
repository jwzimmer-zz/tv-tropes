Lind (published in 2014 under the penname Thomas Hobbes) in which, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>, the United States breaks up into a series of warring successor states, including the Northern Confederation (eventually renamed Victoria) in New England.</p><p>The story is told from the perspective of John Rumford, a USMC captain discharged when he refuses to allow a woman to honor their dead by saying "Iwo Jima" (because no women Marines fought on Iwo Jima, and so he and his buddies feel they do not deserve to participate). After having trouble farming and working, due to government regulations, Rumford forms a group, the Christian Marines, to fight for traditional Christian values in an increasingly multicultural and tolerant society. Eventually, he becomes one of the leaders of the growing movement to restore America to an idealized version of 1930s values. "Retroculture," it is called.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Then the first shots of the Second Civil War are fired, and things get <em>really</em> crazy....</p><p><em>Victoria</em> has been called "the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleoconservatism">Paleocon<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnerDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTurnerDiaries">Turner Diaries</a>" by at least one reviewer, referring to the infamous far-right novel by neo-Nazi William Luther Pierce. While this is less than fair (since, unlike that book, <em>Victoria</em> does not endorse such things as neo-Nazism and genocide of all non-white people), Lind's novel <em>is</em> generally recognized as polarizing and extreme, and often considered part of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">"Alt-Right"<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> milieu (though Lind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheAuthor">does not describe the book, or himself, that way</a>). Written as an apparent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to what the author condemns as political correctness, this book holds nothing back in presenting its radical vision. As depicted herein: atheists are either stupid or evil (or both), homosexuals are perverts, academia is heavily infiltrated by <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School_conspiracy_theory">Cultural Marxist<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> conspirators, UN-appointed Muslim peacekeepers want nothing more than to kill or enslave Christians, Mexican cartels raid America to sacrifice white people to their pagan gods, women <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">should be subordinate to men,</a> and so on and so forth. This uncompromisingly neo-reactionary viewpoint serves to make the book more than somewhat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment">controversial</a> in many quarters.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Contrast <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation">Christian Nation</a></em>, a similar speculative political novel featuring an oppressive, near-future American government with its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La R&eacute;sistance</a> valiantly fighting back &#133; but from a politically opposite standpoint.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><h2>Tropes:</h2><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a>: The Federal Government gradually becomes this during the Civil War, due to a combination of badly failed economic policies and ideological insanity. Mobs and militias fight the police openly in the streets, domestic terrorism is rampant, judges are lynched, state governments begin to secede, and toward the end even the military is experiencing massive defections and passive-aggressive sabotage.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>: The story begins in 2016, two years ahead of its date of publication, and depicts an increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica">oppressive</a> American regime that follows a steep trajectory of post-Obamanian descent into extreme liberalism, identity politics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>. The science fiction elements in society and technology are subtly present almost from the start, then increase as the world advances, and become particularly prominent in the last third or so of the book.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero">Accidental Hero</a>: Rumford, initially, owing his early heroic reputation effectively to making a politically incorrect prank, doubling down on it when called out, and getting cashiered for this. However, the story grows in the telling until he becomes almost a legendary figure of integrity and defiance in the military community, and this is at least part of the reason why he gets elected leader of the Christian Marines. He then becomes a real hero (at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">for a certain definition of hero</a>) by showing himself suited for the position and applying his irregular warfare skills to their struggle against the gangsters and corrupt political machines.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPublicConfession">Accidental Public Confession</a>: Type 1 example with Governor Fullarbottom.

Even Rumford, himself acclaimed as the greatest soldier of his time, agrees that Kraft has a better grasp of military affairs than he does.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGenreHeroGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGenreHeroGuy">Action Genre Hero Guy</a>: John Rumford fits every item on the checklist, except that he isn't fighting to save a loved one, but his country. A somewhat unusual variation in one respect, however, in that he is also a (working-class, one-liner-touting, ex-military) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher">well-read intellectual</a></em>, which makes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SophisticatedAsHell">some funny lines</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">Action Girl</a>: Completely and utterly defied and averted with the "good" female characters. There are some villainous ones, but they tend to appear in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">poor light</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">Affably Evil</a>: The Landwehr emissary is one of the few "enemy" characters to be portrayed as a genuinely-pleasant person, in spite of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">a very-literal Nazi</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a>: Much of the novel takes place against the backdrop of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenStatesOfAmerica">Fallen States of America</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePedophiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePedophiles">All Gays Are Pedophiles</a>: Ultimately subverted, though even then the book is certainly not friendly to LGBT people otherwise. One of the major early incidents in the story is a law requiring all elementary schools to have at least one gay counselor with "unrestricted private and public access" to kids to help them figure out their sexuality, and this is interpreted as being an obvious cover up for the "real" reason gay people would want to be alone with children. Incidents like these lead the State of Maine to rebel against their governor. However, when it is revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">NAMBLA</a> is behind the plot, it is specifically pointed out that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">[e]ven most of the other gays</a> don't like those perverts."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedBoss">The Alleged Boss</a>: President Warner of the late-stage United States is generally presented as a rather well-meaning but weak ruler, usually under the thumb of the extremists and corrupt insiders in his administration. However, he does show decisive and effective leadership <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">on a few occasions</a>, notably when forcing his hawkish military advisors to stand down in the escalating conflict with Russia.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs">All Your Base Are Belong to Us</a>: A favorite tactic of the Christian Marines is to hit enemies where they presume themselves safe, particularly airfields as they raid federal ones for hostages to use against pilots, and in Boston they lure fighter jets into the air then destroy all the runways with artillery.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a>: Azania, though their female pilots are stated to be no match for men in the cockpit, and their infantry folds like a card table.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ambadassador">Ambadassador</a>: Nazi officer Captain Halsing is not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">polite and cultured</a>, but also tough as nails. Additionally, there is Father Dimitri, the Victorians' unofficial (and eventually official) liaison with the Czar's government, who is a former soldier in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Russian Naval Infantry</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi">Ambiguously Bi</a>: Colonel Mary Malone, whose only canonical romance is heterosexual, but who also succeeds and excels in the Azanian hierarchy, where all positions of authority are normally closed to non-lesbians.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryWhiteMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngryWhiteMan">Angry White Man</a>: John Rumford, as well as most of his friends in the Christian Marines (with some exceptions, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopBeingStereotypical">Gunny Matthews</a>). Initially simply an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentBigot">Innocent Bigot</a> who is upset with various sorts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a> in his decaying near-future United States, Rumford gradually becomes politically active as a vigilante and neo-reactionary militia leader. The Christian Marines organization he comes to lead fights for conservative Christian values and against what they term "the unholy trinity of 'racism, sexism, and homophobia'" despite ironically being racist, sexist and homophobic themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalWrongsGroup">Animal Wrongs Group</a>: The Paleopitus, who combine this with fanatical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLuddite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLuddite">eco-primitivism</a> and a nightmarish neo-pagan religious cult.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticGovernor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntagonisticGovernor">Antagonistic Governor</a>: Governor Hokem, who functions as a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarterVillain">Starter Villain</a> for the Christian Marines to take on before the real uprising begins. He is not really very evil personally, so much as simply corrupt and a pawn of the special interests.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Anti-Air</a>: Early after its secession, New England is light on air defenses, with the federal government dominating the air.

There are no male, female, white, black etc. Marines, only Marines. Besides, disrupting a remembrance ceremony is <em>far</em> more disrespectful than any imagined slight.

While Rumford manages to change society very much for the better, at least from his own point of view, and receives due recognition for it, he is never quite satisfied with his achievements. He is also haunted by the bleakness of the past, what America suffered and what his own side had to do to achieve as much as they did.

Notably this is not a government edict, but encouraged as a social norm, because local communities are supposed to be more moral and trustworthy than a state apparatus.

Thus Bill Kraft has no issues with his analog, vacuum-tube television set (despite the story starting over thirty years after the last analog broadcast in 2009).

The ultimate one is his speech on democracy and Retroculture late in the book, where he argues against those of his overzealous followers who want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad">scrap democracy</a> in the Confederation and enshrine Retroculture in law by emphasizing his faith in the good moral sense of the common people.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a>: Rumford (and everyone else) is never less than effusive in his praise of Bill Kraft's genius and class.

The Second Amendement, however, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsArmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsArmed">of course</a> even more carved in stone than the rest of the text.<ul><li> The commitment to the Constitution is somewhat questionable, not least because the founding, core ideals of the Christian Marines is to set the Ten Commandments as the law of the land.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CondescendingCompassion">Condescending Compassion</a>: Rumford very genuinely feels sorry for the black community because of all their crimes, drug abuse and cultural poverty.

The Victorians are horrified at what they see as Azania's unnatural, technological dystopia, where even children are decanted rather than naturally born, and marvel that anyone can live like this; the Azanians, meanwhile, think women in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">reactionary</a> Victoria are little better off than slaves, and acquiesce in their sad fates only due to mind-numbing abuse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfusionFu">Confusion Fu</a>: Fourth Generation Warfare heavily incorporates this.

He is rarely successful, however.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConspiracy">The Conspiracy</a>: Everything from the Declaration of the Rights of Man, to Madonna and rap music, to feminism, gay marriage and neopaganism is "Cultural Marxism", all part of a plot to weaken Western culture and morality and set the people up for a dictatorial communist-in-all-but-name state.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0kcki');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0kcki" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0kcki');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Never mind that the first entry was before Marx's birth.</span> The UN (specifically UNESCO, which funds education and the arts) is a large part of this. It's unclear how Islam fits in, as Muslims are built up as the mortal enemies of all Christendom, but are pretty hostile to all these ideas themselves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrastingSequelAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrastingSequelAntagonist">Contrasting Sequel Antagonist</a>: Roughly, the book's two major story arcs can be divided into "Before Apocalypse" and "After". The villains are quite different.<ul><li> In the first, Rumford and his allies fight against the US federal government, which is immensely powerful in theory, but terminally crippled by corruption, mismanagement, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> economic policies and every conceivable sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>. As far as the raw resources available go, they can easily crush the Confederation on paper, but given how dysfunctional and increasingly fractured the country is becoming, they can only ever mobilize a fraction of their available forces against them, and often not make effective use even of those due to lack of will, political meddling or passive-aggressive sabotage from within.</li><li> Then, in the post-American chaos, the Confederation faces various enemies, but the most serious threats are Leader von Braun's neo-Nazi Midwestern state, and then the West Coast's Democratic Republic of Azania, which becomes the ultimate "villain" faction. The former is basically the Confederation's own dark mirror image, which takes its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightWingMilitiaFanatic">Right-Wing Militia Fanatic</a> style much too far and straight into unambiguously evil (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient">efficient</a>) extremes; the latter, meanwhile, is its ultimate ideological antithesis, a transhumanist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">Lady Land</a>. Whereas the Feds were (with some exceptions) usually either incompetent or corrupt, these enemies are rather leaner and meaner, more of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNonsenseNemesis">No-Nonsense Nemesis</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy">Elite Army</a> variety, though each in turn in its own way: the Nazis have a truly excellent old-school military establishment, with well-organized logistics, good officers and doctrine and first-rate troops, while Azania has the most advanced high-tech military in the setting, employing drones, guided missiles, AI assistance for the staff and various other gadgets.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">Cool Airship</a>: Employed by the Confederation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptBureaucrat">Corrupt Bureaucrat</a>: Judge Frylass, who is the Boston gangsters' chief ally within the judicial system.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">Corrupt Church</a>: The church(es) in the Northern Confederation are viewed this way by the enemy nations. Internally, they are considered harsh but just defenders of Christianity against the Devil's works, much as is also the case with the secular government.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician">Corrupt Politician</a>: Governor Hokem, as well as several others early in the story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter">The Corrupter</a>: As Kraft sees it, the Cultural Marxist academics, who attempt to break down Western Civilization by promoting egalitarianism, feminism, sexual nihilism and other ideologies that may feel good for the individual but invariably harm the greater, common good of society.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoup">The Coup</a>: Soon after independence, one is attempted by Governor Bowen himself, trying to overthrow the lawful government together with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasRevenge">Deep Green</a> militants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a>: Halfway through the book, America is in post-apocalyptic chaos and most of the world is seeing similar degrees of disruption from wars, pandemics, terrorism and the collapse of global trade. With a few commendable exceptions, such functioning states as still exist are all various flavors of dictatorships, ranging from absolute monarchies to fascist dystopias. The ending is also absolutely this if you aren't a heterosexual white male (or even if you are one but don't agree with the book's ideology).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>: Kraft <em>always</em> has a plan. When the Deep Greeners revolt, he not only knows about it before the government, he also has a non-violent (or non-lethal, at least) solution ready for the crisis.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a>: When the Muslims occupy Boston, all Christians who refuse to renounce their faith are crucified.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingThePopulace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrushingThePopulace">Crushing the Populace</a>: The Federal Government, in its terminal stages. The Confederation also offer a few heroic examples of their own, since they believe in <em>thoroughly</em> pacifying enemy territories once conquered.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Culture Clash</a>: Present from the introduction and periodically reaffirmed. Though in this novel there is only the true and good (Christian, European) culture, and all the forces scheming to destroy it, the "Cultural Marxists" consisting of an odd bunch of liberals, feminists, LGBTQ, academics, journalists, environmentalists, actual communists and federalists.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturePolice">Culture Police</a>: The creation of such is rejected, lest government become too intrusive. Instead, people are encouraged to ostracize those who fail to adhere to Retroculture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass">Cultured Badass</a>: Rumford, who has studied history, philosophy and literature, appreciates classical music and writes haiku, and is also a former Marine, eventually literal crusader knight, and recognized as the greatest general of his times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CunningLinguist">Cunning Linguist</a>: In addition to his native English, Rumford knows German, and apparently at least a little Spanish, Latin, and Russian. Justified at least in part by his military education and experience, as well as his private interest in the classics. William Kraft likewise knows German and French, and tends to pepper his dialogue with European quotes and idioms.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">Curbstomp Battle</a>: Pretty much anytime the Northern Confederation/Victoria fights anyone. Special notice must be given to the Numero Uno division, which was surrounded and surrendered with barely a shot fired, the air battles with Azania wherein female pilots often panicked and fled or crashed when faced with any opposition, and the Battle of Seabasticook, where federal troops are ambushed and captured by plaid-dressed militiamen clinging to the underside of a bridge.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CureYourGays">Cure Your Gays</a>: The Azanians who surrender are cured of their lesbianism and feminism by Mrs. Bingham's women's auxiliary, so as to be fit for life in the Confederation. It is offhandedly mentioned that the ones that do not change get sold to the Muslims as slaves. Rumford elaborates his position as not really caring if people are gay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">as long as they're not public about it and don't expect acceptance of their vile lifestyle.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Dark Messiah</a>: Rumford becomes a heroic (or rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">anti-heroic</a>) example, once he really begins his journey to greatness. In his early characterization, he is mostly just frustrated and confused by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a> of the dystopian setting; then he takes his first step by immersing himself in Greek philosophy and reactionary literature under the guidance of Professor Sanft. When he joins the Christian Marines, and especially once he comes under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZenSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZenSurvivor">William Kraft's</a> influence, everything begins to fall together. Realizing his previously untapped phenomenal charismatic potential, Rumford takes over the tiny group of right-wing veterans and transforms it, over a couple of years, into a secret society that infiltrates the police, government and military and builds up major political clout, including a regular political party. Once a major economic crisis comes along, he is ready to act and lead his men as the vanguard of the revolution to bring in the new utopia promised by Retroculture.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkShepherd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkShepherd">Dark Shepherd</a>: Kraft is this to the Confederation, in between purging the Marxists and enforcing Retroculture through peer pressure in the critical early stages of the revolution. He is successful, according to Rumford, making the Confederation a utopia that thrives long after his own death.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawnOfAnEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawnOfAnEra">Dawn of an Era</a>: Several, usually heralded by Kraft's mighty speeches. The ultimate one is probably that which inaugurates the mature Retroculture system in the final chapters.<ul><li> The prologue makes it clear that Rumford, at least, marks the dawn of the Reclamation by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">burning</a> of the woman bishop for heresy (she was a woman, who claimed to be a bishop). Though the ending did elaborate that she denied the divinity of Jesus Christ and rejected the authority of her fellow bishops to judge her.</li><li> In the last chapter, every faction of Christianity lays aside their differences, the most visible religious leaders in a mutual laying of hands ceremony, to declare a global war to drive Islam out of the Mediterranean.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaysOfFuturePast">Days of Future Past</a>: Between Retroculture and the monarchist revival, <em>Victoria</em> has strong tendencies toward this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByCameo">Death by Cameo</a>: Jane Fonda appears briefly just to die in a nuclear fireball.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByRacism">Death by Racism</a>: Either inverted or played straight by the Federal Government, depending on your point of view, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Afrocentric</a> Secretary of Defense, whose prejudices result in resounding and humiliating defeat (and death).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecisiveBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecisiveBattle">Decisive Battle</a>: The battle with the Numero Uno Division, which largely decides the Civil War in favor of the fledgling Confederation and makes a major contribution toward the unraveling of the Federal Government as a whole.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>: Of the techno-thriller genre as usually written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy">Tom Clancy</a> and his epigones. Whereas in such stories the glories of American technology will usually win the day against the Commies/terrorists/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DebtOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DebtOfHonor">Japanese</a>/whatever, <em>Victoria</em> has the high-tech in the hands of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OppressiveStatesOfAmerica">villainous and dystopian</a> near-future American regime, and builds on recent anti-government insurrections in real life to have the low-tech and generally resource-poor freedom fighters win in spite of their underdog status.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a>: After the central government falls, there arises a restored New Confederacy which invokes every related stereotype. Unfortunately, it is itself wracked with civil strife at first- between the "New South" who favor modern life and a system much like the defunct US, and the "Old South" which is agrarian and set in older traditions. With Rumford's help, the Old South definitively wins out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap">Defensive Feint Trap</a>: The primary defensive tactic of the Christian Marines is not to hold their borders, but draw the enemy in and ambush them. This works to great effect at the Battle of Seabasticook, and later (on a strategic scale) against the Numero Uno Division.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantCaptive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantCaptive">Defiant Captive</a>: The elderly Mrs. Lodge, when captured by the Islamic militants and forced to convert or die. She makes it very clear that she will not convert&mdash;calmly and politely, of course, as a lady ought to, but all the same.<ul><li> Also the female Episcopalian bishop in the prologue, Cloaca Devlin, who professes to worship Astarte and Isis rather than Christ, yet still claims she is a Christian. She is not polite, however, but swears and spits at the officials who supervise her trial for heresy. Eventually, she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">burned at the stake</a> for her crimes. In spite of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">similarity</a> between their own religious intolerance and that of the Islamists, the Victorians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">are never presented as wrong for doing this.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantStoneThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiantStoneThrow">Defiant Stone Throw</a>: Rumford is portrayed as offering a non-violent example of this early in the story, when he refuses to accept that women have any business in the USMC. For boldly and frankly indicating as much at the Remembrance ceremony, and refusing to apologize when his politically correct CO leans on him, he is discharged. Most of his fellow Marines are said to agree with him, but few dare to publicly support him for fear of the same.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dehumanization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dehumanization">Dehumanization</a>: Carried out by all sides in most of the wars. In the civil war, the federal government dehumanizes the New England secessionists as irredeemable racists, terrorists, bigots, etc; the Christian Marines in turn dehumanize the politically correct leaders as depraved madmen, and their gangster foot soldiers as worthless "orcs".<ul><li> The reader would appear meant to agree more with the latter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DehumanizingInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DehumanizingInsult">Dehumanizing Insult</a>: Violent criminals and other and other persons of similarly worthless moral character are "orcs". These are mostly members of minority groups, with even the Nazis getting more respect in the narrative.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>: While many of the villains are simply greedy and corrupt hypocrites, the Landwehr and the Azanians both have reasonably coherent ideologies, though they still look alien and "evil" to Rumford and his allies. The former follow a version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Nietzschean philosophy</a> that idealizes strength, will, heroism and racial purity (in opposition to borgeouis, Christian values), whereas the latter are transhumanist separatist feminists trying to build a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Themyscira</a>-like society.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliveryGuyInfiltration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliveryGuyInfiltration">Delivery Guy Infiltration</a>: When the secessionist commandos attack the Federal air force base early in the story, one of the devices they use is a beer truck with faked credentials to get some operatives past the outer security grid.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad">Democracy Is Bad</a>: Some of the Retroculturists believe this, arguing that as soon as the masses get comfortable with the franchise in any society, they'll become corrupt and just vote for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a>, with no regard for the common good. Rumford thinks they sort of have at least half a point, but never goes beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed">Democracy Is Flawed</a>, himself, thinking any sort of authoritarian regime would be even worse. Meanwhile, Kraft successfully defies this, arguing down their anti-democracy position with an emotional speech emphasizing his belief in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">the basic goodness of the common man</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsFlawed">Democracy Is Flawed</a>: Both the corrupt procedural democracy of the late Federal government and the direct democracy of the Confederation are shown to have their problems. The former leads to dysfunction, chaos and, ultimately, social collapse; the latter is not quite as destructive, but nevertheless allows the white majority population to run roughshod over the human rights that racial minorities typically enjoy in more liberal democracies, implementing Draconian laws against black criminality and unconditionally deporting rioting Puerto Ricans out of the country.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>: Rumford explains the erratic behavior of the female neo-pagan bishop this way. The deadpan writing makes it somewhat unclear whether this is to be understood literally or as one more example of his dark humor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedHomosexual">Depraved Homosexual</a>: The "nicest" LGBTTQQIAAP people seen are manipulative crossdressers and violently misandristic lesbians. It only gets worse from there on. In particular, during the Maine Arc, it is strongly implied that the organized gay lobby is made up largely of pedophiles who want nothing more than unrestricted access to other people's children for sinister purposes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration">Destination Defenestration</a>: One of the corrupt federal officials is thrown out of a window and killed by a mob of angry citizens.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSaviour">Destructive Saviour</a>: Rumford and his local Neo-Confederate allies, for nuking Atlanta to defeat a local uprising and make a strong statement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>: Hauptsturmfuehrer Halsing <em>never</em> gives up, as his dramatic escape from Confederation captivity proves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedHomesteader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeterminedHomesteader">Determined Homesteader</a>: Rumford tries to be one, initially, after leaving the Corps, by reclaiming his ancestral flooded lands for a small farm. However, government bureaucrats sabotage his every effort through obstructionist environmental regulations.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieselPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieselPunk">Diesel Punk</a>: The setting increasingly becomes this, as modern high-tech items are worn out and replaced. On the other hand, this also means that the "heroes" get to use some pulpy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperScience">Super Science</a>, as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper">Digging Yourself Deeper</a>: Rumford in the early chapters, when he is dragged before Colonel Ryan to answer for his anti-feminist prank. Instead of faking contrition, he attempts to justify himself by denouncing feminism in the Corps. That goes about as well as might be expected.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommies">Dirty Commies</a>: The Marxists in the story, needless to say, are villains. Rumford thinks the Communists are even worse than the Nazis, not least because they killed many more people. Of course, as "Cultural Marxists" liberal academia shares in responsibility for these crimes.<div class="indent">As a butcher and a tyrant, Hitler ran a distant second to Stalin. That didn&#146;t excuse him, but I found it difficult to put a higher moral value on six million Jews than on eight million Ukrainian Christians, not to mention the other 52 million killed by Soviet communism. Or the 78 million Chinese and Tibetans killed by its Maoist strain.</div><ul><li> Though through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoTrueScotsman">"Cultural Marxism"</a> the definition of "communism" seems to have stretched to encompass all manner of people Rumford doesn't like, primarily leftist intellectuals, feminists and all forms of multiculturalism.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDemocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDemocracy">Disaster Democracy</a>: The Confederation, though it is a democracy only in the sense that political decisions are submitted to the vote, not that they necessarily guarantee any universal human rights, as most democracies are nowadays commonly expected to do.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a>: So many examples, Victoria could swap its subtitle for "Disproportionate Retribution: The Book."<ul><li> Every villain faction justifies its atrocities as retribution for one sort of historic injustice or another. The US Government starts by sending in militarized federal police to subdue Mainers who do not want newly paroled federal convicts as neighbors, and becomes increasingly totalitarian as it decays, beginning to randomly confiscate the movable property of targeted citizens who cannot show a paper trail for every item. As the Civil War escalates, they stoop to assassinating Confederation leaders and <em>de facto</em> excusing murder and rape by their colored troops as justified revenge on whites for structural racism and oppression. Similarly, in the New Confederacy, "Big Daddy" Tsombe ravages all of New Orleans to strike back against historical white supremacy, and the leaders of the Commune in Atlanta launch a genocide of whites and Asians for the same reason after they take over. Among the later successor states, Cascadia punishes even minor environmental misdemeanors with bizarre tortures, while Azania jails any man who so much as jokes about their system in public, and tries to exterminate all of North America with nuclear weapons when they lose the war against the Confederation.</li><li> The good guys themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">also indulge in it</a>.

Given the author's demonstrated great interest in European history otherwise, this is unlikely to be entirely coincidental. Granted, Rumford's right wing libertarian-ish ideology is quite different from fascism, and he spells out his disagreements with Nazi thought at length when he and Kraft discuss politics with Halsing later in the book... Though he still considers the Landwehr Nazis more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a> than the liberals he fought earlier.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontCreateAMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontCreateAMartyr">Don't Create a Martyr</a>: As part of his lessons on effective propaganda, Rumford emphasizes that martyring enemies is extremely bad optics. If someone must be executed, it should be done in such a way that he gets no chance to become one, either by vilifying or humiliating him as appropriate so no one will sympathize with him, or else just merely having him disappear quietly, without attribution. Also, less ruthlessly, he prefers a convert to a victim, and pardons several enemies who are genuinely contrite and willing to switch sides.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a>: The Confederation actively enforces early 20th century social structures and expectations, leading to a fair amount of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>: General Wesley, Army Chief of Staff and later Chairman of the JCS, is one to President Warner in the first part of the book, and shows certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscreamish</a> tendencies.

By the end of the story, they have unbeatable weapons, cold fusion, and are leaders in the production of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld">airships</a>, and all domestic problems have been solved...through millions of dead bodies and a severe loss of modern civil liberties.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenStatesOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenStatesOfAmerica">Fallen States of America</a>: Much of the premise, as the country fragments into successor states, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">each more deranged than the last.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag Operation</a>: There is speculation, but never any confirmation, that the freakishly successful terrorist attack that killed the President, VP, Speakers of both Houses and most of the Cabinet was not the act of a lone-wolf militant. General Wesley and the Christian Marines both had excellent motives to get rid of the people in charge, though both also deny any involvement.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseUtopia">False Utopia</a>: Azania, with a working high-tech economy and tolerance for liberals, gays, etc., looks quite utopian to many mired in the post-apocalyptic poverty and need of the setting, in spite of its horrible politics. It draws great numbers of immigrants and refugees from the other states, even as others also flee from their repression. Rumford and Kraft aren't fooled, but realize that others are being duped into supporting the Azanians' ideas. Which is one reason they decide to attack and destroy the country.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousNamedForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousNamedForeigner">Famous-Named Foreigner</a>: The Nazi leader is named <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun">von Braun<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanOfThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanOfThePast">Fan of the Past</a>: Rumford is a history expert, and often references military and political debates of the 1980s and 1990s to illustrate various points he makes concerning present-day affairs.

To deal with the rampant inner-city crime wave, the Confederation legislates that blacks suspected of violent crimes are to be tried by drumhead court-martial, and any found guilty are to be publicly hanged. According to Rumford, this does indeed somehow solve the crime problem, and the law rarely has to be applied, since the salutary effect of the first few hangings does most of the work.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeminineWomenCanCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeminineWomenCanCook">Feminine Women Can Cook</a>: When first coming to Bill Kraft's home, Rumford is amazed to find his wife there in a dress with a home-cooked meal.

Early on they use the very obstructionism of the bloated government bureaucracy against them, and also showcase the hypocrisy of the politically correct villains, thereby demoralizing their followers. Later, they count (successfully) on the frictions between the fairly grounded and realistic enemy military leaders and the more politicized civilian government to ensure a public relations nightmare on their part in the battle for New York.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>: Halsing to Rumford. They share a common military background, as well as a philosophical and idealistic temperament, but whereas Rumford is a staunch believer in Christianity, democracy and Retroculture, Halsing is equally devoted to Nietzschean philosophy and technocratic Nazism. Also, unlike Rumford, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">well-polished and polite</a>. For Rumford, it is eerie to meet an enemy who is so much like himself, in some ways arguably <em>better</em> than himself, and yet the very embodiment of his own ideological antithesis. This leads to an unspoken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> moment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForYourOwnGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForYourOwnGood">For Your Own Good</a>: Retroculture is so good that <em>everyone</em> in the Confederation must follow it. Those who don't will find themselves under increasing social pressure until they either cave, run out, or are <em>burned at the stake.</em> Though in the setting, all factions are more or less like this about their ideologies (and usually "more" rather than "less").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Founder of the Kingdom</a>: The Confederation effectively has two. Governor John Adams was the first head of state of the independent Confederation, and is remembered as a great leader in war who is celebrated in various ways (for example, a supercarrier is named for him). However, William Kraft is widely considered the real founder of the nation. Kraft was one of Adams's lieutenants in the war for independence, ruled for several decades after succeeding him (with the brief <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnCoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnCoat">Bowen</a> interregnum in between), consolidated and secured the new state, and established <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Retroculture</a> as its national ideology. By the end of the story, he is the object of a veritable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultOfPersonality">Cult of Personality</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Four-Star Badass</a>: Field Marshal Rumford. After a distinguished career in the Marines (cut short by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanBall">evil politicians and their puppets</a>), he spearheads a revolution, leads several brilliant campaigns from the front, and personally hunts down the rogue Cascadian leaders as they try to escape the rebel army.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoxNewsLiberal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoxNewsLiberal">Fox News Liberal</a>: Mrs. Bingham and the other "strong women" on the Confederation's side. They appear to be intended to show that women in the Confederation aren't oppressed, and do have agency and power, which sort of works (to a point)&mdash;But they seemingly only ever <em>use</em> that agency to push anti-feminist agendas.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendInTheBlackMarket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendInTheBlackMarket">Friend in the Black Market</a>: The Yakuza are contacted, indirectly, by Rumford while in Japan to smuggle a bomb into Shanghai. Thus, later when the Chinese are threatening nuclear war, a ship in their harbor blows up, with the clear implication that they could have smuggled a nuke in just as easily. This causes the Chinese to back down.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a>: Captain Halsing is untroubled by the wilderness, and even Rumford's guard dog won't attack him, since it can sense his friendly purpose. Untypical for the stereotype, in that he is otherwise a polite but stone-cold, serious commando.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Friendly Enemy</a>: Captain Halsing approaches this, even after Kraft orders him thrown in irons. Having to fight and risk your life to get out is part of the job, after all, nothing to take personally, and it was still nice of Rumford to offer him a cup of coffee first...</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromCamouflageToCriminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromCamouflageToCriminal">From Camouflage to Criminal</a>: As rebels against the tyrannical and corrupt Federal Government, the veterans who join the Christian Marines are technically criminals, and this is certainly how their enemies see them. Early on, Rumford and Matthews use military discipline and tactics to rally the downtrodden citizens into a formidable force to take on the ethnic crime gangs who terrorize their neighborhoods. We're <em>supposed</em> to see them as good guys.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromMyOwnPersonalGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromMyOwnPersonalGarden">From My Own Personal Garden</a>: Heroic example when Rumford invites the Landwehr emissary Halsing to share his breakfast.

Before he joined their group, he was Willy Welly the moderately successful saxophonist.</li><li> Though he is presented as heroic, Rumford himself can appear this way to those who oppose the Retroculture Revolution: a discharged company-grade officer who tried and failed becoming a small farmer, then launched a political crusade that balloned and ended up as second-in-command of the most powerful of the American successor states.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">Frontline General</a>: Rumford believes that as the military commander, he should be out in the field and close to the action, so he can react to developments quicker than if waiting for them to be reported to his headquarters.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullCircleRevolution">Full-Circle Revolution</a>: Averted in Victoria itself, but present in the New Confederacy, where the transition to independence is less of a clean sweep. The same old politicians, officials and generals by and large manage to retain power under the new flag, with the result that the Confederacy remains almost as corrupt as the United States used to be. So it needs <em>another</em> revolution, assisted by Rumford, before it can finally shake off the remnants of the old regime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFundamentalist">The Fundamentalist</a>: Mainly a political example, though there are elements of hard-line, old-school Christianity, as well. After his conversion by Kraft, Rumford is <em>very</em> convinced of the righteousness of Retroculture, and occasionally filibusters on its main talking points.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyMoney">Funny Money</a>: When the US dollar becomes worthless, Maine prints a new Pine Tree Dollar, printing only what they can back up in gold or foreign currency.

Though his interpretations of them are sometimes idiosyncratic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germanic Efficiency</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> frequently, as Bill Kraft and Rumford are both admirers of German culture and history. However, the valuing of efficiency over rural charm is one of the greatest points of contention between them and the Nazis of Wisconsin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlOnGirlIsHot">Girl-on-Girl Is Hot</a>: Inverted. The good Christians of the Confederation think the lesbianism of the Azanians is just as disgusting as any other kind of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero">perversion</a>."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloriousLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloriousLeader">Glorious Leader</a>: William Kraft becomes a rare <em>heroic</em> example of this. A right-wing ideologue, he uses a deft combination of reactionary agitation, moving public displays and political intrigue to seize power in the fledgling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRepublic">Confederation</a>, and then proceeds to implement his revolutionary agenda. The small but extremely brutal purge of about a hundred and fifty leading Cultural Marxist subversives is his first major executive action, followed by various similarly ruthless acts of national consolidation and limited wars with neighboring states. However, while Kraft's methods are often portrayed as unsavory, the ultimate moral of the story is that they are also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">necessary</a></em> to secure the new state. By the time he passes away decades later, he is remembered very fondly by the people as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">the father of their nation</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">A God Am I</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PathOfInspiration">Paleopitus</a> of Cascadia eventually declare themselves the collective incarnation of the goddess their pagan cult worships, ruling over the pitiful remnants of the Republic by divine decree.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a>: States start seceding from the Union when the population of Newark takes their city back from the gangs, and the Feds try to install the gangs back in power.

They really <em>are</em> succeding in building a high-tech Amazonian utopia&mdash;but the results can easily look pretty horrible if you're not a believer in their extreme female separatism, with a society where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsACrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveIsACrime">Love Is a Crime</a> (if you're a man and a woman) and marriage and motherhood banned.</li><li> At least some readers might think Victoria (and Retroculture) is itself an example.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFlawsBadFlaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFlawsBadFlaws">Good Flaws, Bad Flaws</a>: Played with. Rumford smokes like a chimney, is a bit of a loner, a perfectionist and often extremely cynical&mdash;all traits that are not only acceptable, but almost expected, from someone with his military background. However, he is also very old-fashioned and politically incorrect by present-day standards, to the point of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyIncorrectHero">Politically Incorrect Hero</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>: Rumford is both dedicated and incorruptible, but not the most friendly or socially smooth person most of the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft">Good Is Not Soft</a>: The Confederation are very tough on their enemies. When attacked by bioterrorism, they launch their own bio-counterattack. When rioters take control of Atlanta, they nuke the city. When air attacks are launched against military targets, they chain hostages to them. Generally, their philosophy is to respond to their enemies with extreme force, following Sherman's famous dictum.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKing">The Good King</a>: Czar Alexander, who is both King and Emperor, and generally fits this character type.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoodKingdom">The Good Kingdom</a>: The Russian Federation undergoes an offscreen restoration to an Orthodox Tsar, who becomes a staunch ally and maybe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">something more</a> to the Northern Confederacy. Also the Prussian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaiserReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KaiserReich">Kaiser Reich</a>, which continues to exist, if only the mind of its few subjects.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOlBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOlBoy">Good Ol' Boy</a>: Colonel McMoster is more or less a straight example, though perhaps a little more "upper" middle class than most. He is also slightly unusual in being a positively portrayed, heroic figure in spite of this characterization.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodOldWays">Good Old Ways</a>: William Kraft is a firm believer in this. In a wider sense, Retroculture is this on a societal scale.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSmokingEvilSmoking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodSmokingEvilSmoking">Good Smoking, Evil Smoking</a>: Generally, smoking is associated with the good guys, unusually so for a 21st-century work. Most of the good guys are smokers, and one of the signs of the tottering federal government's villainy is its tyrannical anti-tobacco policies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn</a>: Generally averted; Lind describes some quite horrific violence, but tends to do it in a fairly subtle, understated way. Which can often make it even more horrifying.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentInExile">Government in Exile</a>: Relatively early in the war, a joint Northern Confederation/New Confederacy operation drives the Feds out of Washington and into Pennsylvania. This coincides with the Federal government becoming a military dictatorship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayingMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrayingMorality">Graying Morality</a>: Initially, good and evil are clearly defined: the Christian Marines are persecuted underdogs, and the only people they hurt are crooked politicians, corrupt senior officials and outright career criminals who quite evidently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">deserve it</a>. However, as the civil war goes on, and later the wars of succession, this cleanliness cannot be maintained, as honest-to-God civil wars are generally <em>very</em> brutal and dirty affairs. Before the story is done, Rumford has himself performed (or ordered/approved/permitted) nearly every atrocity he has previously condemned his enemies for, making him realize that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from them as he would like to be able to think.

Also, Kraft is unusually lenient in his treatment of the Deep Green rebels after they are crushed, acknowledging that they sort of have a point in caring about nature, even if their extremism discredits them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a>: Between his maneuver warfare military trickster tactics and shady political manipulations (including espionage, blackmail and downright violence against public officials, as well as more traditional horsetrading), Rumford soundly qualifies. Kraft takes it a step further into out-and-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Chessmaster">Chessmaster</a> territory.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a>: All over the place. How is Victoria a world leader in science without computers, automation or a high degree of technical literacy? Isn't it strange the general votes on major topics always go exactly the way Rumford and Kraft wanted? Especially votes for military intervention when it's said time and time again that all the Northern Confederation wants is peaceful isolationism? Or how everybody spontaneously accepts Retroculture? Why did the Feds stop their bombing campaign because of a handful of hostages, and their blockade after one ship was sunk by a Russian sub?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HangingJudge">Hanging Judge</a>: Encouraged by the Retroculture system to good result.

Especially much the group Kraft designates as Cultural Marxists, or the hard core of liberal ideologues in media and academe who promote post-modernism, atheism, anti-racism and homosexuality (among other things) in order to destroy Western Civilization. Their villainy is taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>, to the point that they make even the Azanians and Nazis look better in comparison.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters">He Who Fights Monsters</a>: The Christian Marines, Kraft, and Rumford himself teeter on the brink of this, if not indeed overstepping the line at times.

Note, however, that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotSoft">Good Is Not Soft</a> is in full effect, so "incorruptible" means anything but "pacifistic" in many cases.

While there are token Italians, Indians, Poles and even one or two blacks and Jews, the vast majority of the named Christian Marines and associates, as well as nearly all of the leaders, have distinctly old stock names.

The closest he comes to actually putting himself in danger is being within an earshot of a drive-by shooting. In fact, for "the greatest soldier of the age" Rumford doesn't do a lot of planning, leading or fighting. He openly shows his contempt by napping through a briefing on weather and road conditions, bombs an allied resistance group's leadership, nukes an allied city, etc. Yet he always has perfect intelligence through his Christian Marine or Kraft's contacts and pulls off some insane stunts like sinking modern ships with spar torpedoes, or taking hundreds of pilots hostage, with little justification beyond the fact that <em>he</em> is the one performing them, and negative fallout for these things is minimal to nonexistent.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem">Inherent in the System</a>: Realistically (in this respect, at least), <em>Victoria</em> does not portray the country's increasingly severe problems as the work of any one evil politician, or even party.

In a meta-example, much of the early story hinges on the idea that law enforcement in the US exists to protect the rights and freedom of criminals to prey on the public at will. This is shown when a judge orders the proto-Christian Marines to cease harassment of criminals in a housing project, when a federal spokeswoman shrugs off the brutal rape and murder of a nun as the due of white people for centuries of oppression, and when Newark is seized by gangs, the residents rise up and answer brutality with brutality, and then the government wishes to send in the army to restore order... and revert control back to the gangbangers.<ul><li> The Secretary of Defense has a moment where she explains that Black people are warriors, because they understand courage comes from the nose and eat their boogers and snot. Whereas white people "wrap yours up in a little surrender flag and throw it away." Therefore, untrained gangbangers are better fighter than a coordinated and trained military fighting force, and they alone should invade Victoria.</li><li> Kraft's speech at Dartmouth, in which asserts that all leftists, feminists, etc. are secretly Marxist, specifically Cultural Marxists, and they are all engaged in a great coordinated conspiracy to destroy Christianity and Western culture. He provides no evidence for these claims, displays only the most basic understanding of what Marxism actually is (and in later chapters links Cultural Marxism to the French Revolution, prior to Marx being born) and, in the story, is treated as totally correct. One member of the audience is visibly distressed that he's about the air the great secret of academia.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Insistent Terminology</a>: According to Kraft, Retroculture is not an ideology, but a way of life.

They in turn are met by local police, militias and ad-hoc self-defense groups that shoot to kill with extreme prejudice, and the near-urban regions become savage battlefields before the swarming locusts exhaust themselves, succumbing to hunger and plagues.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleHero">Invincible Hero</a>: Though a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrontlineGeneral">Frontline General</a>, Rumford does not fight in close combat, is relatively rarely directly threatened and even more rarely has a plan that doesn't go off flawlessly, even when he could control almost no part of it. One time when he doesn't perfectly anticipate his enemies, or rather his allies as he expected the New Confederacy to come down hard on Atlanta, he suffers but a moment of doubt before calling Kraft and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess">coming up with another plan</a> that you might think really shouldn't work (but does).

Because they are the protagonists, they live to a ripe old age, and are remembered fondly long after their deaths.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKlan">The Klan</a>: An unusually sympathetic portrayal for modern fiction&mdash;or perhaps not <em>that</em> unusual given the book we're working with. They appear in the New Confederacy and are seen as a real grass-root movement (as opposed to fakes or federal plants) and even as mostly well-intentioned superpatriot types, but also as misguided and ineffectual.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightErrant">Knight Errant</a>: Rumford is a downplayed example early on when he drifts around after being discharged from the Marine Corps, unsure about the direction of his life but still idealistic, and very happy to jump in and help Gunny Matthews and the others in their battles with the gangsters. Then, he joins the Christian Marines and becomes one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> instead.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>: The Christian Marines desire a country ruled by the Ten Commandments, without evil modern technology, feminism or multiculturalism, and are perfectly willing to go to war, torture unlawful combatants, strip suspected war criminals of POW status, kill political opponents, use blackmail and take hostages, shut down welfare for the needy, deport undesirables, play tit-for-that with weapons of mass destruction, and commit various other brutal acts in service to their goal.<ul><li> In the last chapter, the Tsar abdicates to become the founding Grandmaster of the Order of St. Louis, an international crusading organization dedicated to eradicating Islam from the Mediterranean world and retaking Jerusalem, by any means necessary.

When she notices that one of her faithful attendants has been shot dead with an arrow, she is upset&mdash;because the feathers on the arrow come from a holy owl, and mortals have no right to harvest them.

Isis and Astarte are specific examples, with their idols venerated together with a debased Christianity in syncretistic ceremonies. The Victorians eventually outlaw this cult, and sentence and execute a female bishop who tries to infiltrate it into the Episcopalian Church.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveRedeems">Love Redeems</a>: For Lieutenant-Colonel Mary Malone, one of the theretofore most trusted and politically reliable Azanian officers. Unlike many/most of the others, she is apparently not a lesbian, but merely bitter because of a failed romance in her youth. When she is reunited with her old love, she joins the Confederation and helps disable Azania's doomsday weapons. Other Azanians are also "cured" of their anti-social feminism by falling in love with Confederation soldiers, once they see what gentlemen they are.<ul><li> The remainder are sold into sexual slavery in the Middle East, to experience 'real' patriarchal oppression.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoweredRecruitingStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoweredRecruitingStandards">Lowered Recruiting Standards</a>: Defied by Rumford, who wants to keep the standards of the Christian Marines high, since they are supposed to serve as the elite vanguard of the revolution. Even once casualties begin to mount, he sticks to the old formulas, demanding that recruits should not just be military men in good standing, but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">men of culture devoted to the philosophical heritage of Christianity and Western Civilization</a>. If the Christian Marines ever lose sight of what they are fighting for and why, they are worse than useless in any case; a few true believers are far better than a whole regiment of conscripts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuddWasRight">Ludd Was Right</a>: Modern technology is evil because it creates virtual realities divorced from the true realities, driving long distances destroys communities, and mass-produced goods are always inferior to handcrafted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeASlave">Made a Slave</a>: In the Muslim Invasion, the Black Christian population of Boston is shipped oversees as slaves, and the Victorians move heaven and earth to get them back.

For a few examples: the Christian Marines immediately elect him as their leader; he convinces the Black Muslims who capture him to surrender to the Confederation; and once Governor Adams proclaims independence, he and his military advisors (including actual generals who have joined the rebellion) listen with great interest to the former captain and current militia leader's suggestions, ending up making him chief of the new general staff.</li><li> Perhaps even more true of William Kraft, who is a more accomplished public speaker, and the only man in the story Rumford himself is ever really willing to follow, rather than command.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">Make an Example of Them</a>: After capturing the Numero Uno Division with the promise of sparing their lives, Rumford <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">sidesteps</a> this promise by turning the soldiers over to the communities they brutalized marching North, and they are all hanged to a man.

"William" is a Germanic name that can be read as "The Will to Protect," which mirrors Kraft's firm and repeated emphasis on the will to defend itself that Western Civilization must (at least in his opinion) regain if it is to survive in the new millennium. "Kraft" is German and means power or force, as in "force of nature" (<em>Naturkraft</em>), again mirroring Kraft's forceful personality and drive.

Then, he becomes a great leader of men, gathering a band of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> to stand together against the onslaught of multiculturalism that quickly grows into a veritable army. Though after this, he becomes an increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">ruthless</a> messianic paragon, somewhat subverting the type, especially once he comes under Kraft's influence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicoCalledTheyWantTexasBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MexicoCalledTheyWantTexasBack">Mexico Called; They Want Texas Back</a>:<ul><li> As America declines and the regime comes to depend more on minorities to support its corrupt rule, President Warner eventually agrees with Mexican nationalist leaders to establish a condominium over Texas, Arizona and Newmex. This backfires, however, as the locals strike back, and end up destroying most of the Mexican army in the ensuing war. The resultant power vacuum then allows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Aztecs</a> to seize power in Mexico itself.</li><li> The civil war in California sees that state split.

Apparently whatever deep religious and political differences exist between Islamic nations is nothing compared to their need to get one over on Americans. Though, points for remembering Indonesia in this one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a>: Intentionally invoked by Rumford when he organizes the General Staff, as he wants a flexible and dynamic military command rather than a rigidly hierarchical assembly of martinets.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitariesAreUseless">Militaries Are Useless</a>: Examples abound. Mostly, the forces of the federal government are incapable because of their compassion (not accepting collateral damage) and racial sensitivity, but also because they're chained to a bureaucracy that manages things like supplies and intelligence. Many affirmative-action recruits are also simply incompetent. When acting as an adviser to the New Confederacy of the South, Rumford sleeps through a briefing rather than be bothered by details of the roads and weather, preferring to know about the <em>people.</em> Even the National Guard who become Victoria's military need instruction from the Christian Marines. Their previous training in Third generation war making them useless in combat otherwise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup">Military Coup</a>: Following the death of President Warner and most of his cabinet, General Wesley pushes aside the designated survivor and takes charge himself, appointing a military government in order to make a total effort of the prosecution of the war against the increasingly successful rebels.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryMaverick">Military Maverick</a>: Rumford is the poster boy for this, abetting and indeed encouraging such shenanigans in his command that they have to be read to be believed. And his approach to staff work, intelligence and logistics is... inconsistent, at best. Nonetheless, his ideas nearly always <em>work</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMillionIsAStatistic">A Million Is a Statistic</a>: When dealing with the Nazis, Rumford doesn't consider the Jewish holocaust as important as most people would. He's more upset by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">nature of Nazism as such</a>, their fanaticism about their ideology and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToHisOwnDescription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToHisOwnDescription">the power of the state to control the people through police and propaganda.</a> Well, that and that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">like color TV</a>.<ul><li> This disregard might come from the author's own views, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching">given that he gave a speech at a Holocaust denial conference explicitly blaming Cultural Marxism on the Jews.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinovskyPhysics">Minovsky Physics</a>: This begins to show up toward the end of the story, when the Confederation start to really develop their Tesla-tech.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter">Misery Builds Character</a>: American living standards suffered a global collapse due to depression, civil war and limited WMD use. The Retroculture activists believe that this is not an altogether bad thing, however, since poverty and hardship will unite the people, strike out the remnants of the corrupt old order and help form a better and more just future America:<div class="indent">Our poverty continued to cleanse us of our sins, as the Dark Ages had cleansed Europe of the sins of the late Roman Empire. Consumerism, materialism, careerism, and the "Me First" attitude of early 21st century America faded before the demands and rewards of real life.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a>: Rumford plays this several times&mdash;Naturally enough, after he becomes the Chief of Staff, directing overall operations while the field commanders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">command in the field</a>. However, when he leads an expedition himself, as sometimes happens (for example, against Azania), others are this to him (e.g., Patel during that expedition).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness">Mohs Scale of Science Fiction Hardness</a>: <em>Victoria</em> is at the harder end, with no technology that breaks the known laws of physics (though some, like cold fusion, reach toward the speculative). The military hardware featured for the most part either exists today, or consists of plausible next-generation concepts (when it's not outright <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutTheMuseumPiece">old</a></em> stuff). Biotechnology is somewhat more advanced than might be entirely plausible for the 2030s, however, from engineered super-plagues to Azania's mass-produced artificial wombs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>: The Christian Marines are kept impeccably informed at all times by a number of supporters in the State and local police, by a technician who bugs the Vermont Governor's smartphone, and in one case a Secret Service member on the Presidential protection detail whose brother is a Christian Marine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonumentalDamage">Monumental Damage</a>: Many American monuments end up smashed by some faction or other in the Civil War. Washington itself is ravaged by looters and rioters when the Federal Government evacuates to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and the halls of government ruined and defaced much like those of Detroit in real life. Rumford comments bitterly:<div class="indent">In the former District of Columbia, the Capitol and the White House were vandalized, partly burned and finally taken over by bums and crack-heads as places to squat. Having ruined the nation, they became ruins themselves.</div><ul><li> New Orleans, too, is torn apart and all its historic sites ruined by the Black population, apparently just to spite their white neighbors who "like things pretty."</li><li> A federal drone strike destroys the ruins of the Alamo when Texas secedes, out of petty spite.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow">Mook Horror Show</a>: The scene where the Cascadian Resistance hunt down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">goddess</a> in the wilderness, killing her attendants one by one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralDissonance">Moral Dissonance</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> status or not, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">Dirty Business</a> or not, the heroes do some awful things, usually (but not always) acknowledged to conflict with their own stated morality. If the constant use of hostages, death by hanging, occasional torture, nuking Atlanta or depopulating the Middle East through germ warfare doesn't horrify you, though, there's still a really good chance you the reader aren't on-board for selling Azanian loyalists into forced marriage in the Middle East so they can experience "true" male oppression and patriarchy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">Moral Myopia</a>: The Christian Marines frequently use hostages against the federal government, yet boast of their moral superiority.<ul><li> Particularly strange is the moral outrage when Governor Adams is assassinated, as though Victoria would never stoop to such a thing. Kidnapping, torture, use of hostages, sure, but assassination? Shortly after this, the entire federal government is killed by a kamikaze pilot who, we are assured, had absolutely nothing to do with Victoria.</li><li> The prologue has the Victorians execute a female Episcopalian bishop who worships pagan deities instead of Jesus Christ for refusing to admit that she's not a true Christian, and this is presented as fully justified. But when the Islamic militants demand that Mrs. Lodge convert to Islam or die, it's an act of pure evil. Presumably, whether religious intolerance is evil or not depends on whether it's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">true Christians doing it.</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherNatureFatherScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherNatureFatherScience">Mother Nature, Father Science</a>: Played with in the war between the Confederation and Azania, where it's the feminist dystopia that has all the high-tech toys, and the rugged minutemen only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightMakesMight">romantic spirit</a> on their side. But of course, the Azanians just inherited/stole their tech from the men who built it and don't have much actual "science" worth speaking of, themselves, whereas the Confederation does, even with a poorer tech base. Or at least, this is how Rumford sees it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">Mr. Exposition</a>: Professor Sanft.

The same pilot is shot down and captured, and driven out to see the clean-up. Then he is released to spread the story, and the government thereafter restricts bombing to disabling rail nodes.<ul><li> Also, Gunny Matthews has a rather... extreme reaction to having once said the <em>shahada</em> during the Muslim Invasion arc to infiltrate the occupying force. He seems more distressed over it than the intelligence he gained, that Christian blacks are being taken to the Middle East as slaves, insisting that he's no longer a Christian or "fit for decent people." At least until Rumford gives him absolution. Apart from Rumford's regrets over Atlanta, Gunny is the only Christian Marine ever shown to express remorse for anything he's done.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousBacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousBacker">Mysterious Backer</a>: The Imperial Japanese leaders. Early in the story, they support the oppressive US regime against the secessionists; then, when the government's position looks increasingly hopeless after President Warner's death, they withdraw their aid and instead recognize the Confederation. Imperial Japan subsequently becomes an important commercial partner and occasional military ally to the Victorians &mdash; but always on her own terms, backing them where their interests coincide and remaining largely inscrutable otherwise.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NakedPeopleAreFunny">Naked People Are Funny</a>: When the Pine Tree dollar is introduced, federal IRS agents surround Maine and confiscate any bills leaving the state, until they are ambushed. Most join the proto-Victorians, the rest are stripped naked, have their butts painted red and are paraded before the crowds before being shipped back to DC in a boxcar.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamedWeapons">Named Weapons</a>: Initially averted by Rumford, who prefers not to name the Confederation's warships, instead giving them hull numbers. However, he eventually reconsiders, and names two aircraft carriers after famous martyrs of the liberation struggle: the <em>John C. Adams</em> and the <em>John Kelly</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavalBlockade">Naval Blockade</a>: After the Confederation states declare their independence, the US government institutes a blockade against them to prevent them from obtaining war supplies from overseas. This results in tensions with Russia that ultimately threaten to lead into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>, as the US Navy fires upon a Russian freighter braving the gauntlet.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">A Nazi by Any Other Name</a>: The Landwehr stop just short of actually calling themselves Nazis, but since they employ incredibly obvious fascist iconography, Nietzschean philosophy and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">actual Waffen-SS military ranks</a></em>, they fool no one.

When Colonel McMoster disobeys orders and attempts to intervene against the gangster armies ravaging New Orleans, the politically correct masterminds want him cashiered. But he is allowed to remain in command of his unit because his wife is related to the First Lady, and comes to play a significant role in Rumford's plans.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>: A major fault of the federal government, as well as state regimes in Maine and Vermont toppled by the protagonists, who blame all the failures wrought by their massive incompetence on racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. This is mentioned several times in-story as the result of ideologies being unable to handle objective reality. An uncharitable reader could also see this vault in Rumford and Victoria as a whole, one is discharged from the Marines for his own choice to make a stand against political correctness and is unable to find work but insists it is all due to strangling federal regulation, while Victoria wages numerous "defensive" wars with enemies on the far side of the continent and the world.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat">New Meat</a>: The Azanian units Rumford's Confederate squadron fight seem to be this, being easily frightened and poorly trained. Most of the Confederation officers attribute their poor performance to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">natural female inferiority</a>, but the story establishes earlier on that the Azanians were busily expanding their forces in anticipation of the Confederate invasion, and were suffering a critical shortage in trained personnel in the meantime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">New Media Are Evil</a>: Television and the internet, even computers in general, are often said to create a virtual reality that consumes peoples' real lives and confuses their sense of reality. Naturally such things are forbidden in wholesome Victoria.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTechnologyIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTechnologyIsEvil">New Technology is Evil</a>: At least according to Kraft, Retroculture is the Only Way and post-1930s technology is inherently corrupting and destructive to communities. Though he is not quite consistent about this, approving of cold fusion and various other advanced technologies. It seems it's mostly really information technology he dislikes, for creating "virtual realities" that confuse and disunite people. Well, that and cars that let people casually leave their hometown.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">No Celebrities Were Harmed</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">Averted</a>, with lines like 'that crooner Madonna' and '(the French Aristocracy) gave us Marie Antoinette who had charm and innocence, they (the contemporary political elite) gave us Hilary Clinton, who had neither.'

When the regime begins falling to pieces after its botched final offensive, the President and Cabinet are killed in a supposed lone-wolf terrorist strike, whereupon Wesley proclaims a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepressiveButEfficient">no-holds-barred</a> military dictatorship and attempts to salvage the situation. By then it is too little, too late, however.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManShouldHaveThisPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManShouldHaveThisPower">No Man Should Have This Power</a>: The early, idealistic Rumford believes this to be true of the power of the federal government, seeking to create a very libertarian state with freedom for the people. Whether he succeeds or not is arguable; at least some readers may see something bittersweet in his early encomium to liberty when contrasting it to how the Northern Confederation turns out in practice:<div class="indent"><strong>Rumford:</strong> At one time, America had shunned power, refused power, at home and abroad. Those had been our happy days. Then the "Progressives" came along, who thought the power of government could be used for good. Eventually, they decided the power of government was good in itself&mdash;because they controlled it. <br><br>That&#146;s how it always works: power looks good to whoever has it. But it isn&#146;t.

Instead, he takes part in an armed insurrection against the country to erect a most decidedly un-constitutional reactionary regime. At no point does anyone mention the conflict between Rumford's oath and his action, and the man would likely claim he had a higher loyalty to (what he sees as) the true values and best part of the country.<ul><li> Per his own statement, Rumford does indeed consider himself still loyal to the Constitution. He thinks it's the Government that has betrayed him (and other loyal Americans like himself) by not adhering to its writ.<div class="indent">Our goal was not to overthrow the United States government.

But we knew that government and its Establishment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWillFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWillFail">were going to fall</a>, of their own weight, corruption, ineptness, and disinterest in actually governing.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a>: The various state and federal governments are loaded with these, constantly causing headaches for law-abiding citizens and upholding criminals. Rumford is able to topple the Vermont state government simply by becoming one of these, and insisting they follow all their own rules.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccupiersOutOfOurCountry">Occupiers Out of Our Country</a>: Many in the incipient Northern Confederation (and the New Confederacy) feel this way about the federal agents and government troops trying to maintain Washington's rule in these areas, even before they formally declare their independence. An even straighter example is the reaction to the UN-backed invasion that follows the downfall of the old regime.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlySmallOrganization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddlySmallOrganization">Oddly Small Organization</a>: The decision-makers in the Northern Confederation/Victoria can all fit around one table in a greasespoon diner, and often come to major decisions that way. There is in theory a council of governors of which the leader of Maine is only first among equals, as well as a legal requirement to put every major issue to a general vote, however none of this is ever relevant to the plot, the decisions of John Rumford, William Kraft and 2-3 of their close friends decides the course of the nation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown">Offered the Crown</a>: Not literally, but Rumford is offered the position of head of Free Maine's armed forces.

Though this is contradicted by a statement that every town still has "it's atheist and village idiot, but we didn't much mind them." Globally, there does seem to be a massive movement towards religious homogeny, all Muslim sects set aside their differences to invade the faltering US, and all Christianiy forgiving each other and forming a global army to annihilate Islam.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSchoolDogfight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSchoolDogfight">Old-School Dogfight</a>: Several of the air battles with Azania.

Rumford is able to sink modern warships with spar torpedoes, and arrests a bombing campaign by kidnapping pilots and holding them hostage. The outdated military of the US is utterly helpless against these tactics. (Though the spar torpedo incident was against the Islamic fleet, rather than the US Navy, which perhaps mitigates that one somewhat.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagon">The Paragon</a>: Rumford takes up the old German <em>Auftragstaktik</em> and John Boyd's model of warfare as information management, with individual initiative as the key component. His leadership style heavily emphasizes the importance of getting his subordinates to think for themselves, and he always prefers to command by suggestion and example, rather than detailed orders. He also fills this role as a community organizer, helping Gunny Matthews rally the little people against the gangsters who terrorize their neighborhoods.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagonAlwaysRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheParagonAlwaysRebels">The Paragon Always Rebels</a>: Inverted with Captain John Rumford, who is a heroic example rebelling against the corrupt system in the future United states. When we first meet him, he is clearly being groomed for greater things in the USMC, and as we later see, his intellectual, organizing and leadership abilities are in fact prodigious. However, his old-fashioned country boy values lead him to rebel against feminism in the Corps, getting him cashiered. Then, after some confused floundering about, he begins his second career as a revolutionary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePardon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePardon">The Pardon</a>: When the Deep Green militants rebel and their uprising is put down, Kraft reprieves the captives from execution and instead just exiles them from the Confederation. In order to justify this, he argues that while they are traitors, they are less malicious than merely misguided.<div class="indent"> "Because they erred, they had to pay a price, and they did. The price was banishment. Had we set their lives as the price, we would have gone too far.

Several times, these are presented as subversive cults that seek to destroy the Confederation and its patriotic, Christian American culture.

Actually, besides a few general votes on sweeping policies, elections and voting in general are never mentioned in relation to the Northern Confederation, only the old United States.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutedIntellectuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutedIntellectuals">Persecuted Intellectuals</a>: The massacre at Dartmouth, broadcast to all, sends a very clear message. Multiculturalism, tolerance, political correctness and all other forms of 'Cultural Marxism' will <em>not</em> be tolerated. Almost immediately after, a proper college is erected to teach only the classics and the Western canon.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a>: In spite of Rumford's racism, sexism, homophobia, and general nastiness, he does feel responsible for the welfare of <em>all</em> law-abiding Confederation citizens, even persons of color. This is brought out when he makes a deal with the Arabic slave-traders to get back the blacks they have stolen away from Boston.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopher">The Philosopher</a>: Rumford likes philosophy, and often quotes, paraphrases or alludes to the works of Plato, Xenophon, Clausewitz, Chesterton, C. S. Lewis and various others. Kraft, also. Halsing is a villainous example, who prefers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ubermensch">Nietzsche</a> to Christian thinkers.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing">The Philosopher King</a>: William Kraft, who has not only studied the philosophy of the past, but reflected carefully over the problems of the present.

When the various enemies are finally defeated and society begins to recover from the disasters, Kraft and Rumford are left with the question of how to make sure the Confederation will not grow evil and corrupt once the generation of the founders has passed on, like most democracies seem to do. Some advisors even want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad">scrap democracy</a> because of this and ban all opposition to Retroculture. However, Kraft believes in the people, and ultimately uses his influence to make sure that democracy prevails and Retroculture remains voluntary.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlace">The Place</a>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWordTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWordTitle">One-Word Title</a> is named after the location that parts of America get renamed into.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">The Plague</a>: A large part of the fall is genetically engineered diseases. The Victorians are also attacked this way by Muslims and respond in kind during a prisoner exchange. The Victorians wisely quarantine their recovered people, while the Middle East is depopulated by their tailored diseases.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor">Plot Armor</a>: The only reason we can think of that the Christian Marines didn't get stomped.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonousFriend">Poisonous Friend</a>: Rumford becomes one to Yancey, Laclede and the other Neo-Confederate leaders through his ruthless solution to the Atlanta insurrection, which he then gives them credit for.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">Police Are Useless</a>: The police are utterly unable to prevent any of the early acts of violence by the Christian Marines. When they come up at all, it's mentioned that a number of Marines are disaffected police officers, and so constantly inform their brothers on police plans. A few times, the various governor's plans or federal troop movements are betrayed specifically because they coordinated with law enforcement. In both Atlanta and earlier in the housing battle of Boston, Rumford is easily able to find frustrated and sympathetic officers who are hamstrung by political correctness and eager to aid him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliteVillainsRudeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliteVillainsRudeHeroes">Polite Villains, Rude Heroes</a>: Played straight with Captain Halsing, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">charming and polite</a> Nazi officer, when contrasted to the often abrasive Rumford. Also compare President Warner earlier in the story, who never uses any foul language. Otherwise generally averted.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad">Political Correctness Gone Mad</a>: Azania and Cascadia are, insofar as any real-life political terminology can be applied to them, totalitarian pseudo-Stalinist versions of feminism and environmentalism, respectively. The federal government early in the story isn't nearly as mad, but certainly represents the trope. Rumford comments:<div class="indent">Of course, these were the years of "political correctness." Our colonel was running for general, and he figured he could kiss ass by being "sensitive to issues of race, gender, and class." [...] These were the last days of the U.S.A., and the absurd, the silly, the impossible were in charge and normal people were expected to keep their mouths shut. It was a time, as Roger Kimball said, of "experiments against reality."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyCorrectVillain">Politically Correct Villain</a>: Most of the villains associated with the Federal Government, ranging from honest liberals to cynical grievance merchants and profiteers.

The exception, of course, is the Nazi wannabes, who out-Rumford Rumford in their opposition to political correctness.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyMotivatedTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticallyMotivatedTeacher">Politically Motivated Teacher</a>: First introduced in the form of Professor Sanft, who explains to Rumford that Western Culture is under siege, and continued with the various teachers funded by UNESCO.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PracticalCurrency">Practical Currency</a>: Barter is reinstated during the inflation crisis, despite federal efforts to ban it and empowering the IRS to confiscate any item for which a bill of sale cannot be produced.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticHero">Pragmatic Hero</a>: Ultimately, Rumford wants a prosperous, secure, and thoroughly traditional and Christian state and he's willing to do whatever it takes to get it, whether or not the majority of his people even want it. By the midpoint of the novel, all these traditionally liberal states that make up Victoria have firmly come around to his way of thinking.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreppyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreppyName">Preppy Name</a>: Mr. Montgomery Blair, the Honorable John C.

In the case of Azania, however, almost as soon as women within the Confederation started agitating for <em>something</em> to be done, Azanian bombs started falling.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreventTheWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreventTheWar">Prevent the War</a>: Averted; while Rumford initially argues against Kraft's plans for war against Azania, he is soon convinced by his arguments and acquiesces in the operation. Likewise, a general vote against getting involved in Cascadia fails to resolve itself before the crisis is over and done.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">Principles Zealot</a>: Rumford would rather be drummed out of the Corps than apologize for not recognizing a woman as a fellow Marine.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Private Military Contractors</a>: Evil foreign mercenaries form the praetorian guard of the Cascadian leaders. Rumford's Japanese allies in the same campaign are <em>very</em> technically this, but only in order not to make their involvement in a proxy war official.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperLady">Proper Lady</a>: Maria, Rumford's love interest. Mrs. Kraft also qualifies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>:<ul><li> Kraft's ruminations over the conspiracies of the Cultural Marxists may sound conspiratorial, but he is proved absolutely correct by unfolding events. Even after the downfall of the United States itself, the Marxists in the UN keep trying to subvert and destroy the Confederation.</li><li> For that matter, the Azanians are proved right as well in a way. Their tyranny and militarism might easily be considered paranoid, but Kraft and his followers quite validate their fears by launching an explicitly ideological campaign of subversion and war against them.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistCenteredMorality">Protagonist-Centered Morality</a>: When the heroes take pilots hostage to deter bombing, it's a clever outside-the-box tactic, when the Feds assassinate a Confederate leader, it's a vile crime. When good Christians are sold into slavery in the Middle East, no effort or expense can be spared in securing their return home, when defeated feminists are sold into sexual slavery in the Middle East, it's only their just comeuppance and a chance to show them what <em>real</em> patriarchal oppression looks like.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AProtagonistShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AProtagonistShallLeadThem">A Protagonist Shall Lead Them</a>: Subverted. Rumford becomes the leader of the Christian Marines group quite early, and seems bound to become the leader of the revolution against the corrupt regime. But the Christian Marines end up amalgamated with the bigger and better-connected Retroculture movement, and come under the control of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">William Kraft</a>, with Rumford playing the role of a secondary leader.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExecution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicExecution">Public Execution</a>: The massacre of the intellectuals at Dartmouth is televised to all Victoria. More generally, most executions carried out in the Confederation are public hangings.<ul><li> The burning of the bishop Cloaca Devlin for heresy which bookends the novel.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a>: The regular Army's rank-and-file during the downfall, who are fighting only for their paycheck.

So Victoria has a leader more loyal to his foreign sovereign than his civic duty.<ul><li> Besides which, Russia's financial and military support is invaluable to Victoria, Japan buys and develops all their national parks and China builds a hydroelectric dam in exchange for a hundred year monopoly on power. But at least they're free from the stifling rule of Washington, right?</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetState">Puppet State</a>: Victoria is dependent on Russia for weapons and military/political support, their leader takes orders from his foreign Kaiser, and the Chinese secure a 99-year monopoly on providing power to Victoria, so there are many powerful foreign influences in the new state.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">The Purge</a>: Numerous examples. The televised massacre of ideologically unreliable intellectuals at Dartmouth is the most memorable, particularly since it was carried out with short swords, by men in Crusader cosplay, and a live chorus chanting Latin in the background. Also as the first major public act of the Kraft regime. But other examples are sprinkled throughout, like the forced deportation of Boston's entire Puerto Rican population, and the removal of all Blacks from cities.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">Putting on the Reich</a>: The Landwehr, led by a Nazi wannabe who plays his role as Fuehrer theatrically and to the fingertips, complete with uniforms and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Gratuitous German</a>. They're more hobbyists than "real" Nazis (no connection to the historical Nazi Reich), but they act <em>exactly</em> the way historically semi-literate American World War II nerds would imagine real Nazis would: i.e., <em>even more extreme</em> than the real deal.<ul><li> Also, the bomber used to destroy Atlanta is the last surviving example of a Nazi jet-bomber design from the very end of the war.

Realizing this is a major turning point in his life.<div class="indent">This wasn&#146;t law, I realized, this was war.

While the author views the Confederation as the nicest of the bunch, even they have elaborately staged public executions of political enemies and mass deportations of Hispanics when they cause riots and disorders. Kraft deliberately invokes the trope when his political enemies jeer and hiss at him:<div class="indent"><strong>Kraft:</strong> I too am a revolutionary. My revolution&mdash;our revolution, here in the Northern Confederation&mdash;is against you. Marxist revolutionaries of every yellow stripe, wherever they obtained power, brought 'revolutionary justice.'

He can be quite judgmental at times, especially of people who don't live up to his conservative Christian standards, but is also utterly incorruptible and relentless in the pursuit of good (as he sees it).

Unlike most of the other "enemy" states at this stage, they are competent and an enemy Rumford and Kraft feel they have to respect, even if they think von Braun's philosophy is evil and wrong, and built up as a major threat towards the final story arc, as they consolidate their position and threaten to overtake the good guys with their ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germanic Efficiency</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Though ultimately, the final war ends up being fought not against them, but Azania.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RockBeatsLaser">Rock Beats Laser</a>: Older tech is <em>always</em> better, because Retroculture. Spar torpedoes can easily sink modern warships, old WWII short-wave radar is fantastic at spotting high-tech stealth bombers. T-34s are more reliable and easily repaired than modern tanks, though at least there it's acknowledged they'll want to avoid any pitched battles with newer armor.

Much emphasis is placed on the fact that the masses are cowed and apathetic only due to mind-numbing propaganda and pressure to conform from the evil authorities, and people flock to the Christian Marines' banners as soon as they present a better alternative to the corrupt status quo.

"Modern" technology (which means post-1930s through 2030s, generally speaking) is disallowed, or at least discouraged; on the other hand, however, newly invented science fiction technologies, such as cold fusion or derivatives of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperScience">Tesla's far-out concepts</a>, are perfectly acceptable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">Science Is Bad</a>: Averted; Retroculture doesn't oppose science and technology as such.

The narration occasionally lampshades it, indicating that the author is doing it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">quite on purpose</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheMoneyIHaveRules">Screw the Money, I Have Rules!</a>: Being a man of principles, Rumford would rather lose his job and eke out an existence as a poor farmer than submit to feminist dogma.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">Screw the Rules, I'm Doing What's Right!</a>: The attitude of most of the Christian Marines towards the law.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeekingSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeekingSanctuary">Seeking Sanctuary</a>: Many caught in the disorder and disease of the outside world flee to a better life in Victoria... and are promptly shot and the bodies burned by their highly-effective border security.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a>: Terry Dactyl, the former Marine aviator and aviation buff who made a fortune in real estate and fulfilled his dream&mdash;buying and restoring a real-life World War II jet bomber.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">Semper Fi</a>: Most of the main characters are ex-Marines, and the militia they form (the Christian Marines) is themed on the Corps' good sides.

He still thinks it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">necessary</a> and would do it again, but when he meets the Nazis later, this forces him to accept that he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> from them as he would wish to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>: Lind, a professional military theorist, was one of the legendary Pentagon Reformers, and <em>Victoria</em> shows considerable familiarity with their works. Rumford's tactics are essentially a playful exaggeration of their theories, with a few winks and in-jokes to readers in the know. Of course, not everyone agrees with all of those theories.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpleLifeIsSimple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpleLifeIsSimple">The Simple Life Is Simple</a>: At first it seems this trope will be averted, Rumford struggles to succeed as a farmer. But that's only because of oppressive federal regulations. Later, people are easily able to transition from city life to rural agriculture, particularly the Black population of Victoria who are banned from raising a family within any city.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">Slavery Is a Special Kind of Evil</a>: Subverted. At first, the villainy of the World Islamic Council alliance is established through their crucifixion or <em>enslavement</em> of the Christian citizens of the Confederation, and Rumford continues to treat the Muslim slavers with contempt throughout the story. However, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">later approves</a> the enslavement of the Azanian intransigents, and this is not treated as unforgivable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">Sleazy Politician</a>: Governor Fullarbottom. Unlike most other antagonist politicians in the story, there is no indication that he is <em>corrupt</em> in the sense of being an outright criminal in office, but he is still deeply tied up in questionable machine politics, horsetrading and various shady applications of executive power.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleepingTheirWayToTheTop">Sleeping Their Way to the Top</a>: Rumford's contempt for the Pentagon early in the story includes the observation that, to use a euphemism, promotion there depends less on professional qualifications than on other qualities, and the willingness to employ them. In the context he says it, this may be hyperbole for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalButtKisser">sycophancy and yes-manship</a> or a literally intended complaint against women and homosexuals in the military, of whom he certainly does not think very highly at other points.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGenderInequality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGenderInequality">Sliding Scale of Gender Inequality</a>: Before the collapse, the US is a more or less straight Level 4, with affirmative action trying but failing to give women full equality. Afterward, it becomes a little more complicated; since there is no longer any uniform culture, conditions now vary from place to place. Generally speaking, Victoria and its allies (and most "good" countries abroad, like Russia) are roughly at Level 3, while the "evil" cultures (e.g., the Arabs) are Level 2. Azania, the odd one out, is currently in the process of establishing a stable Level 9 when destroyed by the heroes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVsCynicism">Sliding Scale of Idealism vs. Cynicism</a>: Actually, and possibly unintentionally, rather critical of both viewpoints. The established governments of the world are so corrupt they're collapsing out of sheer ineptitude following years of cynical, callow refusal to commit, while the various movements that replace them are defined by fanatic idealism and a hostile, even genocidal attitude towards anyone who refuses to conform. The protagonists are different only in that the author intends them to be sympathetic and considers their ideology not to be.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">Slut-Shaming</a>: Heroic example, since the Confederation believes in strict morals. They actively champion pre-1950s social values (some hardliners prefer pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilReactionary">1850s</a></em>), and have very strict policies in place against prostitutes, wanton women and other sexual deviants.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashTheSymbol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmashTheSymbol">Smash the Symbol</a>: The Azanian capital at Berkeley is burned, bulldozed and salted by the Victorians, symbolizing the complete destruction of this state and all it represented.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingIsCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmokingIsCool">Smoking Is Cool</a>: Or so thinks Rumford, anyway.

How could we have been so contemptuous of human experience? Did we think it merely a coincidence that all armies, everywhere, that had actually fought anyone had been made up solely of men? But these were the last days of the U.S.A., and the absurd, the silly, the impossible were in charge and normal people were expected to keep their mouths shut.</div><ul><li> He also notes in passing that back in the old US, there were women employed in the government services, implying that this is no longer the case in the Confederation.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillFightingTheCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StillFightingTheCivilWar">Still Fighting the Civil War</a>: One of the largest and most prosperous successor states is the New Confederacy.

Especially much does he emphasize the moral level of warfare, as described by John Boyd. Though Rumford is as much a tactician as a strategist, and is shown to direct several of the critical individual battles. His doctrine on this level depends on high-risk maneuver warfare, mission-type tactics and independent initiative, and he explicitly acknowledges his indebtedness to German thinkers like von Clausewitz and Moltke for his ideas.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Straw Character</a>: Arguably, most of the enemies of the Northern Confederation are some species or other of these.

Later, after the Muslim invasion, there's a prisoner exchange in which both sides expose their prisoners to engineered plagues before turning them over. The Victorians wisely quarantine their returned prisoners and the death count is controlled, while the Arab population is reduced by <em>millions</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a>: To all the forces of 'Cultural Marxism.'

The stated goal of the Christian Marines is "a land where the Ten Commandments are the law." By the beginning/end, non-Christians are banished from Victoria.

Though he was loyal to Governor Adams personally, he's not really behind the Confederation's reactionary ideology, and also comes to resent Rumford's stratocratic tendencies and William Kraft's under-the-table meddling in Confederation politics. Eventually, under the influence of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyMacbeth">Lady Macbeth</a>-like mistress, he joins the mutinous "Deep Green" faction and leads a coup attempt against the constitutional government.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">Tyrant Takes the Helm</a>: Subverted. After the death of the President, Vice President and most of the cabinet and leading legislators in a suspicious-looking terrorist attack, General Wesley attempts to suspend the civil government and impose a military dictatorship, in order to finally deal with the secessionists. However, his troops desert him, and instead the Christian Marines take over.<ul><li> Subverted in another way with William Kraft's assumption of power, which is perhaps best described as a <em>heroic</em> example of this.

To his credit, he will also use <em>only</em> precisely the amount of violence he believes necessary, and prefers to pardon enemies who are no longer a threat, but when push comes to shove, he is utterly ruthless.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName">Unfortunate Name</a>: Irving P.

To its supporters, it is a virtual paradise on Earth, where the people live free of corrupt politics, big-city criminality and all the rest of the many problems of the early 21st century.

On the other hand, there is a very vocal opposition against them in the Confederation, the Confederacy and elsewhere, so their image abroad would ultimately seem to be more polarizing than universally positive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionaryVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisionaryVillain">Visionary Villain</a>: Several of the successor states are run by political ideologues who wish to turn their own nations into what they consider utopias and beacons to the world:<ul><li> Cascadia's rulers want to build the first modern state where humanity truly lives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmonyWithNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmonyWithNature">In Harmony with Nature</a>, without hurting our friends the animals.</li><li> The Nazis want to free the people of the yoke of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Jewish capitalism</a> and build a model Aryan community patterned on the Third Reich.</li><li> Azania's leaders want to create a nation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">of, by and for women only</a>, where they can live without male oppression and develop their own culture.</li><li> Of course, they all use atrocities to make truth of their visions, so even if one may charitably consider their actions well-intentioned in some cases, the actions themselves are monstrous, firmly establishing the "Villain" part.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VodkaDrunkenski">Vodka Drunkenski</a>: Downplayed with Father Dimitri, the Russian priest, who swills a lot of vodka, but is never impaired by it and by and large seems to have the habit under control.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoiceOfTheResistance">Voice of the Resistance</a>: During the Civil War, the regime and its corrupt backers control the mainstream media, but the Christian Marines are able to get their side of the story out through the Internet and (sometimes) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReverseMole">undercover sympathizers</a> inside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine">Propaganda Machine</a> who slip news past the censors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVonTropeFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVonTropeFamily">The Von Trope Family</a>: Leader von Braun, who might (by the sound of it) be related to the German rocket scientist, though Rumford has some doubts about how legitimate his name is. On the good side, there is Prince Michael of Prussia, referred to by his family name as Prince Michael von Hohenzollern.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGod">War God</a>: Invoked by Rumford, though more as a part of his general appreciation of the classics than in literal worship. When the question of proposing to Maria comes up, he argues that due to his demanding (and sometimes dangerous) military work, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarriedToTheJob">already married</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Bellona</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk">War Hawk</a>: Rumford, an isolationist, believes that the Confederation should not seek war with Azania unless they attack first. Kraft, however, realizes that the very concept of a feminist republic is too dangerous and evil to be allowed to exist, and orders military action.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw">The War on Straw</a>: Azania definitely counts. A whole nation of man-hating lesbians, and/or women who are just bitter because they can't get a man.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">Warrior Poet</a>: Rumford, with his philosophical and sometimes almost mystical bent, emphasizing virtue, <em>Zeitgeist</em>, eternal truths and Divine Providence. Among the Japanese, Captain Yakahashi is also one, though his fatalistic Samurai philosophy looks rather bleak to Western audiences. Halsing offers a villainous example and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foil</a> to Rumford, putting <em>St&auml;ndestaat</em> social ideas and Nietzschean concepts of transcendence in place of Rumford's Jeffersonian-Jacksonian republicanism and Christianity.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WashingtonDCInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WashingtonDCInvasion">Washington D.C. Invasion</a>: Actually, averted. In the last stages of the Civil War, the New Confederacy's forces move on Washington, but it falls before they get there, rioters and gangsters turning it into a burned-out ruin as the demoralized remaining Federal troops (and anyone else who can) flee the doomed city.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchingTroyBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchingTroyBurn">Watching Troy Burn</a>: The ravaging of New Orleans, and before that Washington to a somewhat lesser extent. Later, the Azanians get a villainous one, when Rumford systematically demolishes their capital.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreEverywhere">We Are Everywhere</a>: This is the point of the "leaderless resistance" Rumford organizes early in the revolution, with the Christian Marines as its solid core. Not only the organized members, but countless associates and copycats are also encouraged to act on their own, where the system least expects it. By the time Maine's secession approaches, the Christian Marines have infiltrated the whole police and military apparatus so deeply that they can sabotage the entire State Police in a matter of days&mdash;And when Governor Fullarbottom tries to hit back, he finds himself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">handed over to Rumford's men by his own bodyguard</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">We ARE Struggling Together</a>: The secessionists are initially a fairly heterogeneous coalition whose chief unifying trait is their opposition to the increasingly tyrannical Federal Government&mdash;and even that does not always suffice to stop the bickering and internal rivalries. At various times during the first few years of the independent Confederation, especially after the death of the beloved Governor Adams who kept the factions together, the differences boil up, culminating in an outright coup attempt by dissatisfied elements in the political establishment and the "Deep Green" militia faction. Things really only settle down after William Kraft becomes established as the new Governor.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveBecomeComplacent">We Have Become Complacent</a>: This is how Rumford and Kraft view modern, politically correct society early in the story. A people grown soft and dependent on technology cannot resist the onslaught of the Cultural Marxists and their creatures. Events prove them quite correct in this assessment.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLaborInTheFuture">We Will Use Manual Labor in the Future</a>: As everyone returns to an agrarian lifestyle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWinBecauseYouDidnt">We Win... Because You Didn't</a>: This is the strategy Rumford and Kraft successfully pursue against the US federal government. Realistically, their rag-tag rebel forces naturally have no chance whatever to, say, march on Washington and demand its surrender&mdash;but they don't really need to, either. All they have to do is to hold out and deny the Federal authorities control of New England, in order to win the war on the moral level: when the rest of the country sees that the Administration is unable to hinder secession, sufficiently many of the other states also jump on the bandwagon, declaring their own independence in response to decades of Federal abuses, thus leaving the government largely powerless.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomedToTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomedToTheMasquerade">Welcomed to the Masquerade</a>: When Rumford is invited to the Retroculture subculture/conspiracy. Later, he does it for others, as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>: Most of the various successor states at least start out this way, attempting to create utopia with some radical ideology or other. However, most also grow either too corrupt or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar">too extreme</a> to really qualify before long.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">What Happened to the Mouse?</a>: Several of the minor characters don't get any resolution to their stories. What happened to the wise old Professor Sanft? Meyer, the Jew who joined the Christian Marines? The pretty crossdressers who helped bring down Governor Hokem? Rumford doesn't tell.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWouldXDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWouldXDo">What Would X Do?</a>: When Rumford asks, it is: What would John Boyd do?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteGuilt">White Guilt</a>: President Warner, who feels that he can't stand up to Ms. Mowukuu's plan of action against the Confederation because doing so would be racist.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWhiteHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWhiteHouse">The White House</a>: Here as in real life, an eminent symbol of the US Government. It is abandoned when the Government hurriedly evacuates Washington to escape the advancing Neo-Confederates, and ends up ravaged and looted by local criminals.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden">White Man's Burden</a>: Rumford and Kraft prefer Western (European/American) culture over all others, especially African and/or Islamic ones. However, blacks are allowed to live in the Confederation if they are law-abiding citizens; in fact, there is even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesCollaborateurs">Council of Responsible Negroes</a> to look after them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNamesTheirKidDude">Who Names Their Kid "Dude"?</a>: Snidely Hokem, the Governor of Vermont. Also the Honorable Kateesha Mowukuu, Secretary of Defense. And lest we forget, Cloaca Devlin, the God-hating Episcopalian female bishop who was executed for heresy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNeedsEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNeedsEnemies">Who Needs Enemies?</a>: In theory, Victoria lends military aid, in the form of experts like Rumford, to anyone also fighting for traditional religion and culture. In practice, they seem far more interested in destroying their enemies than aiding their allies, seen most dramatically in Cascadia. Learning the Resistance Council are also feminists and environmentalists is all the reason Rumford needs to betray and murder them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedCultured">Wicked Cultured</a>: Captain Halsing, the philosophical Nazi officer. Kraft is a sort of heroic example, who uses philosophy and religion to justify his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">well-intentioned but often ruthless</a> domestic and foreign policies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithUsOrAgainstUs">With Us or Against Us</a>: The attitude of most Victorians. Are you a loyal, traditional American Christian or one of them, the Cultural Marxists? Gunny Matthews summarizes:<div class="indent"><strong>Gunny:</strong> In 1775, a man could be both a Christian and a United States Marine. Now we have to choose. The reason the government we have doesn't work is that it has thrown our whole Christian culture overboard. I don't care whether someone goes to church or not. But unless people follow the rules laid down in the Ten Commandments, everything falls apart.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomanWearingTheQueenlyMask">The Woman Wearing the Queenly Mask</a>: <em>Victoria</em> generally uses male examples, but otherwise plays this dynamic straight. Rumford, William Kraft and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> Sam Warner, last President of the collapsing United States, are all "outsiders" and reluctant rulers who are weighed down by their responsibilities &mdash; and all are forced to take desperate risks, accept the deaths of numerous subordinates, engage in intrigues and crass power politics with their allies, and authorize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">ruthless policies they personally regret</a> in the struggle for survival. And no leader (even on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">"good"</a> side) can ever afford to show any weakness, uncertainty or doubt, except to a few personal confidants, or else his enemies (without or within) will immediately pounce on it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreDelicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreDelicate">Women Are Delicate</a>: The presence of the women in the military is used as a sign of the decadence and irrationality of pre-fall America, while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxActionGirl">Azanian Air Force pilots</a> predictably panic and crash in almost any aerial engagement. The Azanians in general are depicted as high-tech, air and artillery-focused, specifically because women cannot handle the hardships of war.<div class="indent">&#148;Because it&#146;s the only way women can fight,&#148; answered Danielov. &#147;It&#146;s clean, air conditioned, and comfortable. No mud, no bugs, no humping packs or squatting in poison oak to take a shit in the woods. They&#146;d rather buy it than do it."</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomenAreSafeWithUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWomenAreSafeWithUs">The Women Are Safe with Us</a>: After they are defeated, the Azanians are terrified that they will be raped, mutilated and generally horribly mistreated by the Confederation forces. Rumford considers this silly.<div class="indent">None of those things happened, of course. Ours was a Christian army.</div><ul><li> Except for those women who don't renounce their wicked feminist ways. They are sold into sexual slavery in the Middle East.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenPreferStrongMen">Women Prefer Strong Men</a>: Discussed in-story. Women like fighters, and men like to impress women, everyone in the conversation agrees.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkingClassHero">Working-Class Hero</a>: Rumford comes from a humble rural background, and originally applies for rather low-status jobs once cashiered from the Corps.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldWarIII">World War III</a>: Narrowly averted in the last stages of America's collapse, as a naval incident with Russia almost escalates. However, President Warner realizes that his regime can't win such a war, and stands up to his belligerent military advisors, ordering the US Navy to stand down. While this dramatically illustrates the country's decline, it's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">one of the few times</a> the otherwise weak-willed Warner shows himself assertive and competent at a decisive moment. Even the acerbic Rumford gives him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">rare credit</a> for it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>: Hauptsturmfuehrer Halsing of the Landwehr. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who really, truly believes in the Landwehr's ultra-Nazi ideology, he is also somewhat of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass">Cultured Badass</a> who gives a much more favorable impression than any other villain. When captured by the Confederation forces, he escapes, and later there is a callback that leaves Rumford somewhat perplexed:<div class="indent">About three months later, I got a nice letter from Captain Halsing, postmarked Milwaukee, thanking me for my hospitality. He was the model Nazi, cold, competent, and perfectly polite.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldBeRudeToSayGenocide">Would Be Rude to Say "Genocide"</a>: Both Azania and the Northern Confederation practice "soft" genocides while not calling them that. Azania's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Designer Babies</a> society simply does not approve any male births, ensuring that the male sex will "naturally" die out in their country. The Confederation, after conquering Azania, does not physically exterminate the population, but does systematically dismantle and destroy their culture, as well as the advanced technology their all-female society needs to reproduce itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHitAGirl">Wouldn't Hit a Girl</a>: Zig-zagged. Rumford and his troops have no qualms about crushing the all-female Azanians' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">Amazon Brigade</a> with extreme prejudice, nor about condemning captured bitter-enders to slavery. After their defeat, however, he shows untypical concern for the well-being of their civilians, whereas his general reaction to the plight of other enemy populations previously in the story has been indifference at best.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a>: Lind really, <em>really</em> doesn't like cities. Philadelphia is overrun by "orcs," the population of New Orleans destroys their city in an orgy of senseless destruction, Atlanta is nuked after being taken over by Blacks, and New York City is sold to Puerto Rico because nobody wants it and it's wealth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard">Writer on Board</a>: Lind despises anything to do with 'political correctness' and so it is political correctness that leads to America's fall. He is also of the belief that all ideologies ultimately fail because they create a distorted reality. Except Retroculture, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">which is simply acknowledging the self-evident truth.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenByTheWinners">Written by the Winners</a>: Necessitated by the framing device, which presents the book as Rumford's memoirs. This also explains its pro-Confederation bias, as he presents his own view on everything, honestly but very much not objectively or neutrally. One surmises that, say, an Old US loyalist or unrepentant Azanian officer would probably have described and evaluated some things a little differently than does Rumford in his account.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>: Though they do not play a major role in the story, Rumford briefly interacts with them during his mission to Imperial Japan, and they assist him with his demonstration viz. the Chinese. The representative he deals with displays most of the associated stereotypes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreBetterThanYouThinkYouAre">You Are Better Than You Think You Are</a>: Rumford comforts Gunny Matthews when the latter feels worthless for giving in and claiming conversion to Islam in order to survive captivity by the radical Islamic terrorists, rather than becoming a martyr. Since Matthews is a very serious Christian, he has very high moral standards for honesty, and becomes despondent having violated them; but Rumford manages to reach through to him and convince him that God still loves him&mdash;and that his fellow fighters still <em>need</em> him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreACreditToYourRace">You Are a Credit to Your Race</a>: Rumford, in several instances, paying well-intentioned but potentially offensive compliments to women, blacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">Marines</a> and others who rise above his expectations of their respective groups.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotKillAnIdea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCannotKillAnIdea">You Cannot Kill An Idea</a>: Subverted, and arguably inverted, in that it is the heroes who do the killing. Kraft orders Rumford to invade Azania because it symbolizes and embodies the evil ideas that he knows must be destroyed, if the future is to be saved: Not merely feminism, but also the Declaration of the Rights of Man and every other heresy that once sprang out of the French Revolution, corrupting Western Civilization.<ul><li> Also, in the last chapter Rumford joins the Order of St. Louis, and a global crusade to drive Islam out of the Mediterranean.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">You Have Outlived Your Usefulness</a>: Rumford's treatment of the Cascadian rebel leaders is, essentially, a heroic example of this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourTerroristsAreOurFreedomFighters">Your Terrorists Are Our Freedom Fighters</a>: Though portrayed at all times as heroic and utterly in the right, it's hard to ignore that the Christian Marines do a lot of terrible things.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZenSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZenSurvivor">Zen Survivor</a>: Kraft, who becomes Rumford's mentor, is one of the good guys, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnscrupulousHero">pragmatic ruthlessness</a> makes him a heroic example of this rather than a standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype">Mentor Archetype</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld">Zeppelins from Another World</a>: The airships in regular use by the "present" of the story show that the new world is not the same as it used to be.</li></ul><hr><p></p><div class="indent"><em> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Das Wesentliche ist die Tat.</a></strong> </em></div>
