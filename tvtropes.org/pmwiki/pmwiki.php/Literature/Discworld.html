The Necrotelicomnocon is bound in iron plates, the Guide to Levitation has been floating in the rafters for about a hundred and fifty years, and the <em>Booke of Forbidden Sex Majyk</em> is kept in a deep-frozen room and should only be read if you are over the age of 80 and, if possible, dead.<ul><li> To make matters worse, the books, apart from a fair number of them being able to rip the skin from your bones, they can <em>read</em> each other and <em>learn methods to kill you with everything from magic to a door handle</em>.

It doesn't work out for her, but two of her pets (Sam Vimes and a most peculiar young male swamp dragon) rescue her later on. It is noted on several occasions, as recently as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em>, that Sybil is descended from the kind of old aristocracy that kept its place by being more than able to defend themselves. Hence why even in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em> a younger Sybil grabs a ornamental sword (or something else long and metal?) to defend herself when (stranger to her at that time) Vimes comes to the door. There were previous references to the martial activities of Sybil's male ancestors, usually in the context of her even tougher female ancestors looking after everything else, including caring for whatever portions of their male relatives made it back from battle. As well, given the later references to the family apparently never throwing anything away if it could possibly have any use, there's no reason to think that sword wasn't entirely functional.

It's a story about a cart carrying several tons of flour overturning and causing a cart carrying a cartload of eggs to overturn, which in turn causes a cart carrying 30 churns of milk to overturn... Anyway, in <em>Night Watch</em>, after Vimes destroys a certain siege engine, we find out that it is not the biggest cake mix-up after all. As one of people who ordered the siege engine sent against Vimes: "Those oxen were really feisty, sir."</li><li> There's a passing mention of some cheeses having put up a fight when the elves attacked an inn in <em>Lords and Ladies</em>.

Dibbler orders a thousand elephants for a production that never gets made.

Quite impressively, he managed to create an explosive out of nothing but sand and water.

Also he avoided a war through strategic surrender, brokered peace between Trolls and Dwarves, and refused to pursue economic dominance via Golems.

Not doing any magic at all was the chief task of wizards&#151;not "not doing magic" because they couldn't do magic, but not doing magic when they could do and didn't. Any ignorant fool can fail to turn someone else into a frog. You have to be clever to refrain from doing it when you knew how easy it was. There were places in the world commemorating those times when wizards hadn't been quite as clever as that, and on many of them the grass would never grow again."</div></li><li> The wizards are a contentious group, clashing, talking over each other, getting distracted, going off on tangents and arguing over details, but they always figure out what kind of magical trouble is happening, what it means and what they need to do about it.

The magic is so thick that it <em>slows down light</em> to create timezones on the Disc. Magic-heavy areas also completely and utterly play with the laws of physics, making the entire world plausible. In <em>The Last Hero</em> it is stated that if Cohen is successful in his plan to return fire to the gods (with <em>interest</em>) it will disrupt all magic on the Disc for two years.

Whenever there needs to be a reason why the large number of highly skilled wizards of Unseen University cannot counter a problem with magic, one of the standard limitations is that it takes precisely the same amount of work (in the physics sense) to do something by magic as by any other means, and all the other mundane limitations (like action-reaction) as well. The result is that a wizard trying to pick a lock by magic expends most of his effort to keep his brain from squirting out of his ears. Moreover flying without aids (ie, a carpet or broomstick) is theoretically impossible for the same reason, although knocking a big weight off a high place and going up when it goes down is possible.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalCamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalCamera">Magical Camera</a>: Iconographs are little more than boxes containing a very tiny imp with a sketchpad and set of paints.

One of the more disturbing features of the Library is the way the dome of the Library is always overhead, no matter how far you seem to move on the floor in any direction.

Female (witch) magic, on the other hand, tends to be more psychological and more about attuning yourself to nature.<ul><li> Those attitudes can also be seen as the exact opposite: while wizardry is about learning and using that which has already been known for thousands of years, witchcraft is about intimidating magic into doing whatever the witch damn well pleases.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestRoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModestRoyalty">Modest Royalty</a>: Carrot is the last living descendent of the royal line.

(Being effectively a human/wolf mix, they also have a nagging tendency to compromise and think like dogs.)

The werewolves of Discworld also illustrate a rarely-considered point: Humans hate werewolves. <em>Wolves hate werewolves so much more.</em> (This is because humans use werewolves as an excuse to kill wolves, and the opposite never occurs.) A lone werewolf is relatively safe mixing in a human community. A lone werewolf who stumbles into a pack of wolves generally has a very short life expectancy.

Second, you have to deal with all the challenges it brings you, whether it's trying to carry out impossible challenges or dealing with everyone who wants to prove that they're better than you.

Most sapient races are flat out <em>better</em> than humans: dwarfs are tougher, stronger, and live longer (though Carrot, a human raised by dwarfs, is described as a dwarf scaled to 200%, so the strength bit is not inherent but more due to them working out by constantly mining), trolls and golems are near indestructible and incredibly strong (and trolls are incredibly intelligent when in cooler temperatures), vampires have all their standard strengths and can even learn to replace their lust for blood, werewolves are extremely capable in combat and have fantastic regenerative capabilities, pictsies are unbelivably strong and ferocious (gnomes are described as being as strong as a human despite being the size of a Barbie doll), Igors (if they count as non-human) are all brilliant surgeons and also great healers, and orcs can only be called superbeings. Humans do, however, seem to be the only race that produces wizards, witches, or sourcerers. Even <em>one</em> of the latter can potentially invert this trope. They're also the most numerous and gregarious, and have the most infectious culture. They're also the most innovative.

Even partly-trained but powerful casters can be dangerous to themselves; for example, "borrowing" an animal's mind can lead to a witch becoming lost in the animal's senses.

The complete lack of a Weirdness Censor is one of the abilities of wizards and witches; in the Tiffany Aching books, it's called First Sight. Young children also often lack a weirdness censor, because they don't yet have any real expectations as to what the universe is like; in <em>Reaper Man</em>, a child is the only person who recognizes that the recently-retired Death (going under the name "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName">Bill Door</a>") is not just a tall, skinny guy, but rather (as she puts it) "a skellington."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WikiWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WikiWalk">Wiki Walk</a>: Leonard of Quirm, the wizards of the university, and some many other characters are fond of these.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchClassic">Witch Classic</a>: The pointy hats are very important, since a lot of being a witch is based on everyone else <em>seeing</em> you as a witch.

Broomsticks are generally only used by witches, even though they're made by dwarfs and can be flown by anyone, even without magical talent. One difference from the standard version is that although witches are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a>, and Discworld magic is hereditary, witchcraft <em>isn't</em> passed down from mother to daughter here, it being considered that young witches should learn from another witch with a different way of doing things to prevent a family's magical style from coiling in on itself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardClassic">Wizard Classic</a>: Most of the wizards in the series conform to this image, no doubt out of professional pride.

It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a>: In many, if not most non-English European language, "Death" is a gendered word, and of <em>feminine</em> gender too in Latin and Slavic languages. The French translations systematically include a footnote the first time grammar causes Death to be referred to as male, and as the series progresses, they get increasingly cheeky. The one in <em>Small Gods</em>, for example, has the translator and editor encouraging "readers whose sensibilities are so offended"... to outright read all twelve prior Discworld books.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfBadass">World of Badass</a>: If you intend to mess with someone here, make sure they're not witches, wizards, watchmen, werewolves, dwarfs, trolls, Mrs. Cake, demons, gods, gnomes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Mrs. Cake</a>, vampires, pictsies, heroes, assassins, the Luggage, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">Mrs. Cake</a> or, last but not least, the Librarian. It's a wonder that anyone else is left in the place.<ul><li> In fact, attempting to mess with Death is probably your safest bet on this world. The most he'll likely do is act confused/amused at your antics and walk away. (Note that this covers messing with Death himself. Mess with anything he <em>cares</em> about, and regret it.)</li><li> If you think that you can take down a watchman, make sure they're not Vimes, Carrot, Angua, Detritus, or Dorfl. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14ic7y');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note14ic7y" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14ic7y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Remember that he is lightning-proof (which is how he remains a living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a>), functionally immortal, as he can be ground up and simply be re-baked, and very, <em>very</em> strong.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfPun">World of Pun</a>:<ul><li> Pratchett likes to include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">at least</a> one silly pune, or play on words, per book.</li><li> The name of the countries Djelibeybi and Hersheba. Terry Pratchett's realization that American audiences weren't getting the Djelibeybi pun inspired the creation of nearby Hersheba, which most audiences in general aren't getting. (If you've heard of the candy, the Djelibeybi pun is criminally easy to get, due to it being mentally pronounced the same way, <em>and</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> when we're told Djelibeybi literally means "Child of the Djel." Hersheba is not as easy &mdash; this is due to variation in pronunciation (the most obvious pronunciation rhymes with Bethsheba), the fact that it doesn't have a lampshade, <em>and</em> it doesn't have a book focused on it. Once you remember that some British accents add an <em>r</em> sound to words ending in 'a', though....</li><li> The Ramtop Mountains are named after RAMTOP, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> system variable which points to the top of user memory.</li><li> Bhrian Bloodaxe, the first dwarf according to Discworld legend, is named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> game <em>Brian Bloodaxe</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantKillWhatsAlreadyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantKillWhatsAlreadyDead">You Can't Kill What's Already Dead</a>:<ul><li> Zombies are much more resilient and stronger than humans, with watchzombie Reg Shoe taking a crossbow bolt through the chest and only complaining of the puncture holes in his armor. They are, however, very vulnerable to fire.</li><li> Werewolves are apparently considered undead by the narration, with one surviving a fatal bullet wound as the bullet wasn't silver.</li><li> Vampires can be killed/turned to dust temporarily, but almost always come back when exposed to drops of blood. A sword through the chest has no effect on them, and they can survive being beheaded (and then direct you how to reattach their head).
