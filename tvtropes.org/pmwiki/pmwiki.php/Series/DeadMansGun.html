It's unclear if he's meant to be Gisella's son or just a kid she took in (the later is implied by how he calls her Madame Gisella even when their alone together but that might just be out of habit to make her seem more mystic and mysterious to the costumers).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>: In "The Sleepwalker" the main character is willing to turn himself in a more and more proof mounts up, believing he deserves it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Before the reveal that he's innocent.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadHabits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadHabits">Bad Habits</a>: In "Sisters of Mercy", the gun is stolen by a pair of Irish con artist sisters posing as nuns, who soon become the unlikely heroes of a small town under the thrall of a corrupt banker.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a>:<ul><li> In "Buryin Sam", after people stop dying for a while, there's a scene of a coffin with a body in it, then it's revealed it's just Andrew the carpenter taking a nap.</li></ul></li><li> In "The Healer" the episode opens with Christy talking to a woman whose clearly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissKitty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissKitty">Miss Kitty</a> type, who says it's been a while since she spent so much time on her back. Christy, lying down, replies it's been so long since she hurt that much. Then it's shown that she's in the middle of childbirth, having a baby. Also, the background of the scene showing the doctor walking home form the delivery implies the women may have been workers at a dress shop rather than prostitutes.<ul><li> In "The Fortune Teller", Peggy (the first customer Madame Gisella is genuinely able to see the future for) is visited by her boyfriend, Richard with flowers, just like Gisella predicted. Then the young man starts talking about how he's inherited a business in San Francisco and will be leaving to take it up. Peggy says she's happy for him, while turning away to hide her crushed face....then Richard says that it's a business he'd like to run with his wife, and proposes to her like Gisella saw.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchGunshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchGunshot">Bait-and-Switch Gunshot</a>: In "The Impostor", Leo is confronted by outlaw Wild Joe Tate, who knows that Leo is not the real John Hayes.

The young man is subjected to somewhat unpleasant treatment, and observing a lot of the crooked and cold-blooded methods of his boss. At the end of the episode, he figures out what Travis is up and sets him up to get arrested, which he gleefully photographs (although its unclear if he's intending to become just like Travis or that is merely a one-time deed he felt Travis deserved). He also takes possession of the gun, but implies that he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> enough to not hang onto it for any longer than necessary.</li><li> In "The Regulator" Susan is introduced as a reporter following the hired gunman Slattery, wanting to write his memoirs.
