The Conners were generally stable but were still prone to dealing with domestic arguments, problematic neighbors, daughters who seemed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">like bad boys</a> and taking in a kid whose home life was far worse than theirs. The Healey brothers, Mark (Glenn Quinn) and David (Johnny Galecki) were added to the show as long-time boyfriends to Becky and Darlene, eventually marrying them. The show was also noted for a welcome subversion to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife">Ugly Guy, Hot Wife</a> rule.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Famously&mdash;or perhaps infamously&mdash;the final season of the show's original run dramatically changed things by seeing the Conners escape their slave-wage working class existence when they won the lottery. Unfortunately, shaking up the status quo let out all the air in the balloon, so to speak; viewers preferred things the way they were because the family's struggle to make ends meet was part of the formula that made the show a success. Ratings tanked and brought about the show's cancellation and a hasty attempt to wrap up the series. This controversy resulted in an even more bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">conclusion</a> when writers tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> the entire last season, only to throw in a bunch of surprise turns of events no one had really asked for, as it was almost like someone took a sledgehammer to a lot of plots that had been central to the series throughout its run.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>In 2017 it was announced that most of the cast was reuniting for a revival, consisting of an eight-episode season that later increased to nine, and then ten.

The premiere's ratings were so high<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0655l');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0655l" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0655l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it got more viewers than the original series finale over two decades earlier &mdash; which is remarkable considering the exodus of viewers from network television in the interim</span> that it was renewed for a second (or eleventh &mdash; the show is being promoted as a continuation of the original series rather than a revival) season two days later. However, the revival was cancelled on May 29th, 2018, after Barr herself made racist tweets comparing Valerie Jarrett, a black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Obama Administration</a> official, to an ape, on top of pushing conspiracy theories and dog-whistle remarks well before that.</p><p>Eventually though, ABC announced their intention to build an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aftershow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aftershow">aftershow</a> spinoff <em>without</em> Roseanne, titled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheConners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheConners">The Conners</a></em>. It was greenlit on June 21, 2018, and premiered on October 16 of that year.

Dan's mother was also (literally) insane, and his father was a traveling salesman who was rarely home. You'd have an easier time finding parents who <em>aren't</em> abusive on this show; even Roseanne herself has an episode where, in a fit of anger, she strikes DJ, and then panics over it because she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotMyFather">wants very badly not to be the kind of parent her father was</a>.<ul><li> Mark and David's mother, especially to poor David. It's a mark of just how bad <em>everyone's</em> parents were that when Roseanne lets Dan know that she's agreed to let David live with them, he initially refuses ... until Roseanne says "Dan, I grew up in a house like that." Dan immediately sighs and leans back on the bed, accepting that he can't let David go back to that kind of house.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorAllusion">Actor Allusion</a>:<ul><li> When Michael O'Keefe (Fred) left the show, he went to another show on ABC called <em>Life's Work</em>, where he was the husband of an assistant district attorney with two children. In one episode of <em>Roseanne</em>, while complaining about Fred's Christmas present to Jackie, Roseanne says that they never see him "since he moved in with that D.A. chick with them two kids."</li><li> It could be coincidental or <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

After Darlene tells Dan and Roseanne, they're trying to sort out how to talk to Becky about it. Dan cracks up, hard, and Roseanne is also trying hard not to laugh, while berating Dan.</li><li> The second incident happens in Season 5's "Crime and Punishment." Dan has been called to DJ's school to discuss some "obscene reading material" DJ brought. It's a comic Darlene wrote. When Dan shows Roseanne, he's appalled. Roseanne laughs unexpectedly and says "That was a funny part."</li><li> Season 4, "The Back Story": Becky mentions that she's been moved up to the express lane in her job as a grocery checkout clerk, and Jackie's impressed, saying this must mean her bosses have confidence in her abilities.</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Becky:</strong> Yeah right.

Doesn't help that Roseanne teases her about them, and a woman at the health spa in season 9 says they're "much too small for her body".

Before marrying Mark, in the first season she cheated on her boyfriend with a similar leather-clad stud named Johnny Swanko, aka "The Tongue Bandit".

Jackie is upset that she's done something she regrets, but won't spill the beans. To try to get her to open up and tell them, everybody else starts talking about bad things they've done. They're all very forgiving when Roseanne mentions pledging (but never donating) a huge amount of money to a telethon just to hear Jerry Lewis say her name on TV and when Bonnie reveals she and her husband once robbed a liquor store. However, when Jackie announces that she slept with Arnie, everybody else is disgusted and outraged (apparently in high school, they all took a blood oath and promised he would never be allowed to breed). In fact, when Roseanne realizes, "She will forever be known as the woman whose sister slept with Arnie," everybody ignores Jackie and starts to comfort <em>Roseanne</em>. Sleeping with Arnie was just <em>that</em> unforgivable.<ul><li> The list of complaints lobbied against her former husband by Bev goes from jaywalking back to arson: "He was rude to my children, cheated on me, had horrible table manners and made me drive an old car with bald tires!" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> when one considers that bald tires are much more likely to blow out, so that last one was a legitimate danger to Bev's life.</li><li> ** In "A Stash from the Past," Jackie is horrified to discover Dan and Roseanne preparing to get high:<div class="indent"><em>Jackie</em>:You're rolling a joint after yelling at David for bringing pot in the house?!

She goes from failed career to failed career, is physically abused by one of her few serious boyfriends, gets pregnant out of wedlock, and ends up marrying the father only for them to get a divorce after barely a year. Is it any wonder she's such a mess by the final seasons?</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a>:<ul><li> Darlene gets hit with this hard in Season 7. For years she was the ultimate deadpan snarker, constantly belittling everyone from her family members to her boyfriends. It was mostly treated for laughs, but the repercussions of her actions really hit her hard after she breaks up with David. First the guy she left him for leaves her due to her poor treatment of him, her family gets angry at her for turning down a lucrative job that would have set her up for life, and David tells her (with prompting from Becky) that he believes that they never really connected, which devastates Darlene. It all culminates in the episode where she does get back together with David, and she tearfully tells him how she feels, in probably what could be her most vulnerable moment in the entire series.<ul><li> This was also directly addressed by Roseanne when Darlene wonders why her siblings and father are so upset by her usual snarking. When she was living in the house, her snarking came across like they were all in it together and were merely dealing with humor. However, after she left for college and had job opportunities (including one specific opportunity for a $30,000 salary job, which she turned down), and then also continued asking for financial help from her family, Roseanne pointed out that she seemed like 'one of them', with a superior attitude and her snarking came across as mean-spirited and condescending instead of affectionate.</li></ul></li><li> Becky gets this to a point, too. Early in the series, she gets good grades and, when she's not being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyTeenageDaughter">Bratty Teenage Daughter</a>, does most of the chores and takes care of her younger siblings. She believes she's on track to go to college and get out of Lanford, until the bike shop runs into trouble. Through a series of bad choices (based as much on her attitude and rebellion against her family as circumstances), she ends up living in a trailer park and working at Buns, a Hooters-style restaurant.<ul><li> Becky gets a more immediate example of it in the season two opener, "Inherit the Wind," in which she hides out at home after accidentally breaking wind during her speech to the student council. Darlene in particular rubs salt into Becky's wounds, crowing, "I've been waiting for something like this to happen since I was two!" Becky kind of deserves it after having been such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> to Darlene at the beginning of the episode for no reason (and without provocation).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a>: "Roseanne-feld" features the family members who appear making fun social calls; this episode comes between Harris's high-risk birth and members of media looking to buy the rights to the Conners' rags-to-riches story.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: The lottery ticket that would make the Conner family one hundred and eight million dollars richer shows up briefly in the episode before, when Bev almost uses it as a coaster.<ul><li> Season 4 episode 2, Roseanne is speaking to a sales guy on the phone. She puts him "on hold" by putting the receiver on top of the radio. Later, when Bev calls Jackie at the shop, she does the same thing.<ul><li> Season 4 episode 25. A politician comes to the door and talks to Roseanne about his plan to offer tax cuts to out of state businesses, to entice them to set up in his jurisdiction. Roseanne delivers a great speech cutting through all of his sound bytes and he leaves. A few scenes later, the same politician shows up at Dan's bike shop. Roseanne comes out of the back and says "Oh, hey!" And he goes running.</li></ul></li><li> In "Pretty in Black," When Roseanne is approached about using the money she and Dan inherited from Beverly to join Jackie and Nancy in a business venture, Roseanne and Dan discuss the prospect in bed:</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Roseanne</strong>: Shouldn't we put that money toward DJ's college or Darlene's bail?</div><ul><li> Later, in "Crime and Punishment," when Darlene has to bail Dan out of jail:</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Darlene</strong>: You know, I bet when you imagined us in this situation, you always pictured yourself on the other side of those (jail) bars.</div><ul><li> In "Don't Make Me Over," DJ stops turning in his math homework and makes up an excuse about Dan having died. In "Truth or Consequences," Dan responds to a request for a parent conference at DJ's school, and the bewildered principal brings up DJ's claim.</li><li> Season 5, Episode 13. Dan is called into DJ's principal's office after DJ is caught with a violent pornographic comic book. The principal (who previously assumed Roseanne was a widow since Dan never turned up for school conferences) casts aspersions on Dan's parenting, especially after DJ reveals that the comic's author is Darlene. In the final scene of the episode, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dan is in the back of a police car, in handcuffs, after assaulting Jackie's abusive boyfriend, when they pull up to a red light beside another car being driven by the principal.

It's not too bad, but her barely legal boss has a superiority complex and can't understand how her family comes before her responsibility to <em>him</em>. The family actually makes more fun of her when she gets a job sweeping hair at a salon.</li><li> Her waitress job at the restaurant in Rodbell's had some tones of this as well. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadJobWorseUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadJobWorseUniform">ridiculous costume</a> for starters, and her boss Leon seemed to enjoy making them suffer; when the restaurant finally went under, he told them that management had phased out those horrible uniforms years before. Leon himself said he hated the place as well. When the diner was shut down, on their last day, they had a toast in which he said, "We're not standing in the parking lot watching the place burn, but this is nice, too."<ul><li> Becky, though, was initially distressed not that her mother would be working as a waitress, but that she'd be working in one of her favorite hangouts.</li></ul></li><li> The salon job was something of a subversion. Roseanne's coworkers all understood the job was crappy but they never made Roseanne feel bad about it and were pretty nice, if a little ditzy; at the end of her first day, when her boss asks her about the job, Roseanne says point-blank, "I hate it," the boss, realizing that the job sucks, says, "Of course you hate it, but are you staying?" Roseanne was not very pleased when the only ones who were making her feel bad about it were Dan and the kids.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>: Bev is easily the most abused character on the show, though given her treatment of her daughters at times it's almost justified. Darlene also treats Molly this way, and Roseanne treats just about everyone this way except Darlene, who can match her snark for snark.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CainAndAbel">Cain and Abel</a>: Mark is the Cain to David's Abel. In one later season episode, David finally calls Mark out on his selfish, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> tendencies when Mark is deliberately and remorselessly hitting on a young waitress at the Lunch Box in whom David is interested (while he and Darlene were separated) just to show he could and to make David miserable. After the two get into a fight and Becky shows up, David lies to protect Mark, and then tells Mark he doesn't know why he did - and warns him that he's hurting Becky, the only other person besides David who actually <em>likes</em> Mark at all.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>: In the pilot episode Dan and Roseanne have a fight about how Dan doesn't do anything around the house, leading to this exchange.<div class="indent"> <strong>Dan</strong>: You want me to fix dinner?

The only difference is now Roseanne says "<em>eleven</em> years ago."<ul><li> Except it isn't true. At least once we've seen Dan cooking a meal, making chili, imitating Julia Child.</li></ul></li><li> The season six episode "Busted" also features a scene in which Dan and Mark's roommate are watching a Spanish-dubbed version of the pilot episode, with that very scene playing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>: The entire ninth season as of the revival. Most notably, Dan is shown alive and well in said season, retconning <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his death</span> in the original series finale. It even gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscontinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscontinuityNod">Discontinuity Nod</a> when he wakes up in its first episode, where he asks Roseanne <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">why everyone thinks he's dead.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDeath">Character Death</a>: Roseanne's dad. Given their strained relationships, his death brought out mixed feelings in Roseanne and Bev (and temporarily drove a wedge between Roseanne and Jackie, as Jackie made excuses for his behavior and also objected to his mistress Joan being invited to the funeral), but in the end he was missed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>: Quite a bit, but Mark is a particularly notable example, going from your standard bad boy rebel to a goofy dork with rough edges.<ul><li> In the first seasons, Darlene was a sports-obsessed tomboy who always had her hair tied back into a tight braid to give a boyish appearance. But the moment she started going through puberty she let her hair down, started avoiding sports all together, and abandoned all of her friends to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a>.

Although sometimes justified at least one neighbor moved away, and coworkers lost touch because of the main characters getting a new job.<ul><li> Crystal, one of Jackie and Roseanne's closest childhood friends, gets married again to Dan's father Ed and vanishes from the show pretty quick. She becomes more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">The Ghost</a> up until the end of the series, where she actually has one last appearance during Roseanne's baby shower. Why neither she nor Dan's father appear at later notable events like their granddaughter/honorary niece Darlene's <em>wedding</em> or following the Conners' lottery win is a mystery. At one point during Darlene's wedding, Dan mentions that he hasn't spoken to his father in two years.</li><li> Jackie's husband/ex-husband Fred stopped appearing altogether a couple episodes after they divorced, although was occasionally referenced as taking care of their infant son in various episodes. Like other characters, his absence in the face of the Conners winning the lottery (including his best friend and boss Dan, his ex-wife Jackie and his infant <em>son</em> Andy) is nigh-inexplicable.</li><li> One neighbouring family, the Tildens, introduced a few seasons into the series got tons of episodes and development, including one daughter pursuing main character David and her overweight wallflower sister catching Roseanne's attention as somebody who needed support and guidance. The Conners even all traveled to California with them in an RV at one point. Unlike their previous sets of neighbours, who'd had proper send-offs, they eventually just stopped appearing.</li><li> Lampshaded beautifully in "Breakin' up is Hard to Do" with Dan breaking the fourth wall, pleading with the audience to bring him back, only to mouth off the an off-stage Roseanne. The "In Memoriam" tribute is a wonder to behold. Ironically, he <em>did</em> come back for an appearance in one episode.</li><li> In "It's No Place Like Home for the Holidays" (season 5, episode 12), we meet Mark and David's little sisters: Lisa Healy (played by Clara Bryant) and Nicki Healy (played by Sarah Freeman). We never see or hear of them ever again, not even when David's subsequently "adopted" by the Conners in "It's a Boy" (season 5, episode 19). Considering the reason David's taken in is because of their mother's <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Any use of copyrighted music was removed or dubbed over with generic music, and any credits sequences featuring music or celebrity cameos were replaced with generic credits.

This sequence can still be seen on TV airings.<ul><li> When all the seasons were re-released, the only music that was restored was the various uses of "When You Wish Upon a Star" (both the actual song and characters singing or chanting it) in the two Disney World episodes.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>: Roseanne is the master at finding creative and downright twisted ways of disciplining her children.

To top it off, she kissed him goodbye with caked on bright red lipstick.<ul><li> Dan was no slouch in this department, either. In one episode, Becky and Darlene try to get permission to go to a concert in Des Moines by buttering up Roseanne and saying that Roseanne and Dan deserve a weekend to themselves. When she realizes they were just trying to manipulate her (instead of being actually <em>nice</em>), it really hurts her feelings, which sends Dan into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>.

Roseanne and Jackie began to suspect their mother is secretly bald, after finding a wig that looks exactly like Bev's hair. Bev reveals that she is indeed bald, followed by everyone else revealing to a shocked Roseanne that they're bald too. Roseanne wonders how she could manage to top this prank.

When Dan calls from California he says he's most looking forward to coming back home to all the familiar things he's missed. Roseanne is horrified because after winning the lottery, she redecorated the whole house, threw all the old stuff out, and it wasn't the same familiar "home" Dan was looking forward to. She then changes into an eye-popping negligee, under the theory that "Men prefer boobs to end tables any day." Jackie rather abruptly says, "Well, it's working.

Roseanne says it's his diner, too, and he'll get to help. He automatically shouts out that he wants to name it.

It was later revealed in season four that Al Harris was physically abusive toward his daughters and cheated on his wife for 20 years. Once this revelation dropped he never appeared in the show again and died off-screen in the fifth season. Every subsequent mention of him depicts him as a terrible father.</li><li> David was called "Kevin" during his first appearance in season four. Lampshaded in season six when Roseanne says that "David's not even his real name, Darlene made it up".</li><li> In the first Thanksgiving episode in season 2, Dan's mother Audrey appears, played by Ann Wedgeworth, and is shown to be a relatively "normal" person with her and Dan's father Ed being more or less amicably divorced. Later seasons would have her played by Debbie Reynolds and completely change her character and her relationship with her son and ex-husband, turning her into a mentally unstable woman who was constantly in and out of mental hospitals. Dan's father did what he could to shield his son from his mother's problems but was often gone for long periods of time for his job as a salesman and this put a strain on his relationship with his son. Dan would eventually put his mother up on a pedestal and blame his father for every problem he and his mother had when he was a child.</li><li> The earliest appearances of Arnie (Tom Arnold's character) portrayed him as just another one of Dan's friends, with Roseanne and Jackie not really knowing much about him. Later episodes would portray him as someone they went to high school with and thought was incredibly stupid, to the point they made a vow to never sleep with him, so he wouldn't procreate.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">Everyone Has Standards</a>: The Conners wore their title of "white trash" with pride, and delighted in doing uncouth and rude things while mocking everyone and everything that came into their lives. However, there were certain topics that were <em>never</em> the subject of jokes, and lines that even Roseanne wouldn't cross.<ul><li> Jackie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">abuse at the hands of her boyfriend Fisher</a> drove Roseanne into a genuinely fearful panic, and set the typically calm Dan on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> that ended with him in jail.</li><li> When DJ refuses to kiss a girl a school play because she's black, Roseanne tells him in no uncertain terms that she won't tolerate him being racist, and furthermore says that anyone who disrespects black people is an embarrassment to "respectable" white trash like them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> with one episode where Roseanne and Bonnie confess dark secrets like falsely promising a donation to a telethon and robbing a liquor store.

The only character who was dropped from actor billing was Crystal after she stopped appearing, but numerous other characters were introduced who became indispensable to the show's plot, particularly Bev, David, Jerry, Leon, Mark, Nancy, and Scott. However, none of their actors ever got more than a guest credit, as the main billing became strictly limited to the fictional immediate family (minus Jerry, who was born later) and Jackie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourTemperamentEnsemble">Five-Temperament Ensemble</a>: Darlene (choleric), Dan (melancholic), Becky (phlegmatic), Aunt Jackie (sanguine), and Roseanne and D.J.

When asked why she didn't act this way all the time, she said, "Well that wouldn't be much fun now, would it?"</li><li> A particularly bad example happened with Mark. Originally a leather-jacket-clad greaser bad boy who wasn't booksmart, but always seemed sharp and was shown to be even better than Dan at fixing motorcycles. After marrying Becky and returning to the show he became an idiotic dope/manchild who routinely shocked the rest of the characters with his lack of sense. Only when teaching David how to tie a bowtie before the latter's wedding at the end of Season 8 did Mark's original stoic, streetsmart badboy persona get one last moment in the spotlight. <br><br>There was one other moment, though, which showed some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths">Hidden Depths</a> as well. Becky becomes frustrated at living in a trailer and begins to look at going back to school. Mark is against it since they were planning to start a family and tells Roseanne to butt out. However, as the episode wears on, Mark tells Roseanne about how Becky is making all these decisions without him and he's afraid she's going to outgrow him, ending the episode by asking Roseanne how many doctors are married to mechanics, and sarcastically congratulating her on getting a doctor in the family and getting rid of him at the same time. It shows him as a vulnerable man scared he's losing the woman he loves instead of the chauvinistic pig he'd been before.</li><li> And David. He went from a mildly sensitive artist from the wrong side of the tracks to an uber-sensitive, in-touch-with-his-fem-side, snobbish doormat.</li><li> Jackie is one of the worst sufferers of this. In the earliest seasons, she's a confident, clever woman with bad luck in love. She's slightly neurotic, but it just added to her charm. Later on, the neuroticism completely engulfed her character to the point where any little thing would reduce her to a babbling twitching mess. It was amazing to think that she wasn't in a mental hospital with her kid taken away. Possibly justified when one considers it really started around the time she was involved with Fisher, who later turned out to be abusive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>:<ul><li> The episode "Ladies Choice" becomes funnier after Bev comes out in the final season. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Granted, it was all part of Roseanne's book, but still</span>.</li><li> Outside of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roseanne's stories</span>, Jackie did come out as a lesbian, and looking back, there are quite a few (probably unintentional) references. Aside from picking traditionally masculine jobs as a police officer and trucker (and remembering that <em>Roseanne</em> did make use of gay stereotypes quite frequently), there were frequent jokes about it. When Nancy came out to Roseanne and Jackie, they mentioned that she didn't act it, since she wasn't a flannel-wearing trucker (Jackie was wearing flannel at the time, and had been a trucker), and during her wedding Jackie said to Dan that if she didn't know there were nice guys like Dan in the world, she'd have given up on men a long time ago.</li><li> In a couple of episodes before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reveal">Reveal</a> that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Fisher is abusing Jackie</span>, he gives off some minor hints of his behavior by telling Jackie that she should stop seeing her therapist and she should spend less time with her family: commonplace signs of what is really going on in their relationship.</li><li> Also, in one episode of the final season, Roseanne is talking to Jerry as she's feeding him. She talks about the more bizarre things happening, and then says, "It's almost like some crazy lady made it all up."</li><li> In season 2's "House of Grown Ups" episode, Roseanne says "Darlene's practically dating, and at this rate, Becky's gonna be married." The always boy-crazy Becky was barely 17 when she got married.</li><li> Seasons one and two are <em>full</em> of subtle nods to Dan and his health, particularly his heart, and most of them are casual throwaway jokes. After a discussion of Crystal's late husband Roseanne jokingly wonders aloud what would have happened if Dan had lived, Bev nags him about not sleeping on his side because it's bad for his heart, and so on. Of course it's not out of place, Dan's a big guy and he and his wife are both overweight. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then we find out that Dan didn't actually survive his heart attack.</span></li><li> "Brain Dead Poet's Society" has Roseanne talking about how Darlene could be a really good writer, and Darlene's supposed "joke" of a poem being really moving and well-written. Flash forward to her high school years, where Darlene would write many short stories as well as co-create a comic with David. She even tested out of high school to go to college early on a writing scholarship.</li><li> In the Disney World two-parter, Roseanne jokingly suggests that she and Dan cash out his life insurance policy to go on a cruise. Dan smiles and says "I don't think that's such a good idea." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out he's right...</span></li><li> In the series finale, Becky snatches a pizza away from DJ and starts wolfing it down. At everyone's astonished look, she defensively mutters that she's hungry. A few scenes later, we learn she's pregnant.</li><li> When Roseanne and Jackie visits Darlene while she was dating Jimmy, Roseanne takes every opportunity to insult him. In the end, he has enough of it and demands some respect. This moment assure Darlene and Jimmy weren't going to last because of Darlene also disrespecting her own boyfriend.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotToPayTheBill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotToPayTheBill">Forgot to Pay the Bill</a> : Roseanne had a "system" in place to juggle the bills, a familiar scenario to any working-class family. The Season 5 episode "The Dark Ages" dealt directly with the Conners having their power shut off due to non-payment.<div class="indent"> Dan: I thought you paid that.</div><div class="indent"> Roseanne: Well, it was a choice between that and the water bill, and you can only live three days without water.</div><div class="indent"> Dan: You mean I can take a bath, but I can't throw the toaster in?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>:<ul><li> Roseanne and Jackie are implied to have <em>quite</em> a few issues with men due to their father's abuse &mdash; mainly Jackie's promiscuity, but a case could certainly be made for Roseanne's control issues (the show also mentioned it might be the reason behind Roseanne's overeating).<ul><li> "Let Them Eat Junk" also revealed that Roseanne's tendency to eat when she's depressed comes from Bev's using ice cream and other sweets to calm her down as a child, instead of trying to figure out why she was upset.</li></ul></li><li> Nana Mary theorizes that Bev's behavior in being ultra-conservative and submissive to her husband was a result of rebellion against Mary's promiscuousness and wild streak she had as a mother.</li><li> Mark and David also reveals a few of these later on due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>, Mark being super jealous of his wife ever trying to have a friendship with other men (even his own brother) due to the fact his mother would cheat on her husband constantly, and in David's case, his super submissive-streak towards Darlene as he put up with her abuse early in their relationship is in direct correlation to how he was treated by his mother.</li><li> Becky and Darlene seem to have this too. Becky's is more lighthearted&mdash;her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">love of bad boys</a> seems to be her taking after her mother. Darlene's was initially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>&mdash;she had verbally abusive streak towards men which lasted quite awhile&mdash;but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">reality kicked in</a> when David broke up with her, and her follow-up boyfriend did the same left her specifically because she treated him like crap. Fortunately, Darlene gets better after she realizes what she's doing and that she really did love David and wanted to make it work between them (she's still snarky thereafter, but also tries to be more compassionate).</li><li> Another episode indicates that D.J. is beginning to develop this, as he has a girlfriend who treats him like absolute garbage and bosses him around non-stop. This may be one of the few cases of an audience getting to see a Freudian Excuse <em>developing</em>&mdash;D.J.'s surrounded by women who dominate the men in their lives, and he hasn't yet learned that there's a difference between spousal teasing and genuine abuse.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemies">Friendly Enemies</a>: Leon and Roseanne are this in spades. They were polar opposites (Roseanne the heterosexual, blue-collar, working-class liberal feminist and Leon the homosexual, moderately wealthy, CEO conservative), swapped insults constantly, and delighted in making each other's lives a living hell. However, they were also willing to help one another out when the situation arose&mdash;Roseanne made Dan invite Leon to his weekly poker game and even stood up for him when she thought he was going to be fired for being gay, while Leon turned to her for advice when he was fearful of his upcoming marriage (a wedding Roseanne herself planned).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a>: Mark had shades of this. David once pointed out that the only people who liked having him around were himself and Becky, which doesn't count for much since David is his brother and Becky is his wife.

It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">These people were supposed to be poor, right?</a><ul><li> And yet, it took about six seasons before Roseanne finally got the dishwasher she'd been asking him to install since the beginning of the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCobblersChildrenHaveNoShoes">The Cobbler's Children Have No Shoes</a>: Roseanne frequently asked Dan to build or install various things for her (the dishwasher, built-in shelves, an ironing board in the wall, etc.) He constantly put them off; however, when he was renovating the house he hoped to flip for profit, he added them all in. Roseanne said it felt like he was cheating on their house with another one.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>: Roseanne once got a phone call from Darlene and Becky while she was at work about something D.J. did. Roseanne could barely hear anything over Becky's scream, but all we know about what D.J. did is that Roseanne promised she would bury it in the backyard when she got home.<ul><li> There was also an incident with some hair in the drain that didn't belong to anyone in the family.</li><li> A later episode mentioned that after DJ got a friend, the squirrel population in the neighbourhood doubled.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeriodsPeriod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeriodsPeriod">No Periods, Period</a>: Averted. Aside from episodes centered on Roseanne's comically insane mood-swings, Darlene's first period, and a pregnancy scare, periods are pretty much the domain of cheap jokes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a>: Repeatedly lampshaded with David and Darlene, after the Conners took him in.<div class="indent">Roseanne (to Dan): Oh, look honey, our kids are necking.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche">Nouveau Riche</a>: The ninth-season has the Conners becoming this after winning the lottery ticket. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or so Roseanne would have us believe.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The end of a later season episode revealed that Bev is actually faking her spazziness as a way to mess with her family</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">Obliviously Evil</a>: Meg Wellman, spoiled, self-absborbed, condescending to the point of consistently misnaming people, and literally leaving destruction in her wake, has no idea what a godawful human being she is and casually buys off her victims because she's just <em>that</em> accustomed to exploiting the working class. Crystal describes her as being too rich to know any better.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">Oedipus Complex</a>: Dan has very serious, unresolved issues with his father throughout the show's run. It doesn't help when Conner Sr. marries one of Roseanne's friends and has a kid with her.<ul><li> It can be <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">argued</a> that this is David's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> for putting up with Darlene's verbal and emotional abuse. His mother was extremely verbally abusive toward him and his father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">absent</a> or possibly a doormat himself, so this is how David responds to Darlene. Plus, there was that dream about Roseanne...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>: Dan goes into shock after Fred tells him in "Don't Make Room For Daddy" that he took his advice and is suing Jackie for custody of their baby, something Dan suggested in the previous episode in the heat of the moment (he was mad about other matters at the time).<div class="indent"><strong>Fred</strong>: You were telling me how a man's got to stand up for himself!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Dan</strong>: Well, that was different, I was sleeping on the couch, I had nothing to lose!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldPeopleAreNonsexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldPeopleAreNonsexual">Old People Are Nonsexual</a>: Bev gets kicked out of the retirement home because she was having too much sex, much to the disgust of her daughters Roseanne and Jackie.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>: Averted. DJ's full name is David Jacob, although he's rarely referred to as such. Oddly enough, David was originally called Kevin.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OohMeAccentsSlipping">Ooh, Me Accent's Slipping</a>: When the Prince starts to drink, a Texan accent starts to show up.<ul><li> In the series finale, Glenn Quinn's normal Irish accent slips out slightly.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>: An in-universe example. While not an Unfavorite, DJ was often forgotten about by both his parents and the writers because he kept to himself while his sisters caused endless grief and drama. One episode had him totally silent for almost the entire thing, but then ended with him telling his horrified parents he'd gone two days without speaking and they hadn't even noticed.<dl><dd><div class="indent"><strong>Roseanne</strong>: He needs to learn to bitch and moan like his sisters, or he ain't gonna make it in this family!</div></dd></dl></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a>: One memorable episode has Dan going to beat up Becky's boss after he insults her. Too bad Mark gets there first.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverthetopChristmasDecorations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverthetopChristmasDecorations">Over-the-Top Christmas Decorations</a>: After receiving notice from the neighborhood association about not putting up tacky Christmas decorations on their property ("a string of white lights" only), the Conners decide to have a "white trash" Christmas and Roseanne and Dan compete to find the tackiest Christmas stuff.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaddingThePaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaddingThePaper">Padding The Paper</a>: Dan helps Darlene write a history report on Betsy Ross. When they finish she brags about doing five full pages, and Dan quips, "Should be, you wrote big enough."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">Parental Favoritism</a>: Played straight and inverted. One episode directly dealt with the fact that each parent had a "favorite" daughter. Roseanne favored the more girly Becky while Dan favored athletic, sporty Darlene. Deliberate attempts to reverse this ended badly.<ul><li> Roseanne, though, mentions in season four's "The Back Story" that her favorite child is D.J.</li><li> On the other side of this, Roseanne and Jackie each developed a favorite <em>parent</em>. While in their parents' first appearance, the girls seem equally irritated by both of them, later on, Roseanne began to favor their mother slightly since their father was physically abusive and unfaithful; whereas Jackie defended their father, saying he was doing the best he could in a bad situation, while absolutely despising their shrill, controlling, judgmental mother, one time genuinely hoping that dropping the news she was unmarried and pregnant would kill her, and telling Fred that he could only refer to her either as "Bev" or "Sea Hag."</li><li> Bev seems to favor Roseanne over Jackie, but one episode deals with this in depth. When she saw the way the two acted as children, she saw much more potential in Jackie, and believed she would be a highly successful professional instead of floating from one mediocre job to another. However, she always saw Roseanne as being a wife and mother, and is happy for her for achieving that. She had high hopes for Jackie and sees her as a disappointment, but is proud of Roseanne for exceeding her (lower) expectations. When this is revealed, both Roseanne and Jackie feel like they got a raw deal out of it (especially Roseanne).</li><li> David Healy actually became this to Roseanne even though he isn't her son. She actually admits she might actually like him more then Darlene.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSavingsSplurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSavingsSplurge">Parental Savings Splurge</a>: One episode has Becky trying to apply for financial aid for college, and she needs Dan and Roseanne to provide necessary information. As it turns out, they make too much for her to qualify for the aid she anticipated... and her college fund has been spent. In this case, the money was not spent on frivolities but rather on things like the mortgage, while Dan struggled to keep his business afloat. Becky, however, is not sympathetic.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsWalkInAtTheWorstTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentsWalkInAtTheWorstTime">Parents Walk In at the Worst Time</a>: Played with brilliantly in two episodes:<ul><li> In "Like a Virgin", from Season 3, Roseanne and Jackie come home from the movies (with Dan and Jackie's then-boyfriend) and hear noises coming from the living room, which is dark. Roseanne figures she'll get to turn on the lights and surprise Becky and her boyfriend...except it's <em>Darlene</em> (who no one knew was even interested in sex) making out with Brian, a friend of hers.</li><li> At the end of "Playing with Matches", from Season 5, Roseanne and Dan think they're walking in on Darlene and David...except it's <em>Beverly</em>, who's with one of the guys from her nursing home.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingGertrude" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingGertrude">Playing Gertrude</a>: The math on Bev and Nana Mary's ages is a little hazy, but Shelly Winters is only seven years older than Estelle Parsons.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingSick">Playing Sick</a>:<ul><li> In "Communicable Theater," the family is at Jackie's play, bored out of their minds. Dan says he has to go home because he's sick. He really is coming down with the flu, but this inspires Becky and Darlene to start fake-coughing and saying that they need to leave too.</li><li> Dan tells Roseanne he can't help with the dishes because he has a nasty hangnail and "it's gonna smart like hell on that dish soap."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot">Poorly Disguised Pilot</a>: In one episode, Roseanne is in New York and meets the women of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbsolutelyFabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a></em>. It didn't really seem to be a pilot, until you realize that Roseanne was attempting to produce an American version of the show. It then seems like she brought over the <em>Ab Fab</em> ladies to see if their British style of comedy would fly in America. (It didn't.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreemptiveShutUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreemptiveShutUp">Preemptive "Shut Up"</a>: Used with Darlene primarily.<div class="indent"> <strong>Roseanne:</strong> <em>[after Dan gets bailed out of prison]</em> Well, people have been saying it for years, but now with Dan going to jail and all, we are now officially... poor white trash!</div><div class="indent"> <em>[Everyone claps and cheers as Dan plays "Oh!

However, as the seasons wore on, Roseanne the actress began to wear much more flattering hair and makeup, lost a bunch of weight, and combined with her real life surgeries, her looks definitely improved.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>: When Roseanne's real-life marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomArnold">Tom Arnold</a> fell apart, his character was written out of the show. He left his wife a letter claiming to have been kidnapped by aliens. The episode's tag showed it was <em>true</em>.<ul><li> This was also due to Arnold getting his own short-lived series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">The Bus Came Back</a>: Arnold's character returned in one episode to try to patch things up with Nancy, claiming his alien story was him panicking at being married. The end, however, reveals he was abducted by aliens and was trying to get Nancy to go back with him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCyrano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCyrano">Playing Cyrano</a> : In season 3's "Communicable Theatre" episode, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> has an unusual example. Jackie is the understudy for the lead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/CyranoDeBergerac">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></em> and is unprepared.

Since the show was a reflection of Roseanne's real life, they needed to create a rags to riches plot to reflect Roseanne achieving success as a stand-up comic. That's where winning the lottery came from.</li><li> "Real life wrote the gag" in "The Test," the opening episode of Season 3 (1990-91), with this line that referenced Roseanne Barr's controversial U.S. National Anthem performance at a baseball game in July 1990:<div class="indent"><strong>Roseanne:</strong> Boy, it's such a beautiful day today, it just makes me wanna SING!</div></li><li> Later lampshaeded in "Home Ec" when Darlene and her classmates point out a woman who's on the cover of all the gossip magazines.<div class="indent"><strong>Roseanne:</strong> She's a damn good singer, though.</div></li><li> Season 4's breast reduction episode, after Roseanne had her breasts reduced.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a>: Jackie and Molly.<ul><li> The similarity between the two was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> by Darlene, who also compared Molly's sister Charlotte to Roseanne.<div class="indent"><strong>Darlene:</strong> You two are so screwed up.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Molly:</strong> We are not!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Darlene:</strong> Oh please.

Although their numbers (5-7 for Dan and 5 for Roseanne) aren't that high, it's still a fair amount of dating and sex for a couple of chubby high schoolers (Roseanne was 16 and Dan 17 or 18 when they started dating). There's probably little else to do in Lanford.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the New Guy?</a>: Roseanne's husband at the time, Tom Arnold, joined the cast as recurring character Arnie Thomas, who was a good friend of Dan's and everyone acted like he was there all along.<ul><li> There are also details dropped about him (such as him driving a lime green monster) in his first appearances that were previously associated with a character named Dwight. Dwight was meant to be a close friend of Dan's who had sent a lot of contracting work his way, but he never appeared on the show again after Arnie came and took his place.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReReleaseSoundtrack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReReleaseSoundtrack">Re-Release Soundtrack</a>:<ul><li> When <em>Roseanne</em> was first released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment, the final two season sets suffered from this. Any use of copyrighted music was removed or dubbed over with generic music, and any credits sequences featuring music or celebrity cameos were replaced with generic white-on-black credits.</li><li> Most infamously, this included replacing the credits of the Season 8 premiere, which was a parody of the opening from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePattyDukeShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePattyDukeShow">The Patty Duke Show</a></em> lampshading the fact that two actresses alternated between the role of Becky.

When David sadly sings it to himself when he thinks he's not invited on the trip, he is dubbed over with a canned audience "aww". When Roseanne leads the family in a military cadence-style chant of the lyrics on their way to the park, they're dubbed over with the show's typical scene change music. The various uses of the original song played over the family enjoying the park were replaced with the 1812 Overture. When all seasons were re-released by Mill Creek Entertainment, this episode was the only one to have its original music restored; the rest of the replacements from the Anchor Bay release carried over to the Mill Creek sets.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousseauWasRight">Rousseau Was Right</a>: Mark starts off as a rebel, but is accepted by and marries into the Conner family.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunawayTrain">Runaway Train</a>: Played straight in the infamous episode "Roseambo," but is a deliberate runaway set up by women-hating terrorists.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyNameTrailer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyNameTrailer">Say My Name Trailer</a>: A commercial for the revival shows a series of clips of Roseanne hollering for Becky from the original run, then shows her doing it again in the revival.

Others, such as Roseanne Barr's weight-loss surgeries were also addressed (specificially in a throwaway line where Roseanne said she has lost quite a bit of weight working in the diner and being around food so much, it now makes her queasy.)<ul><li> Like pregnancy, it was convenient to do so, being a <em>necessary</em> surgery in real life as well as on the show.

She belittles him and often denies him the chance to father the kids (which those kids need). Not that Dan is much better, given the chance; their whole family <em>is</em> situated at Dysfunction Junction, after all.</li><li> In the first season episode "Radio Days", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeClooney">George Clooney</a>'s character is ogled and wolf-whistled by a factory full of women when he bends over and shortly thereafter has his ass slapped by Jackie. Needless to say, if it were a room full of men doing that to a woman, it would've been decried as sexual harassment.</li><li> Unlike most sitcoms, there was an episode that dealt with this. When D.J. started dating, the first girl he went out with bossed him around and treated him like dirt, and he did nothing to stop it. Roseanne saw it and was forced to accept that it was because he thought this was perfectly acceptable, since he grew up watching Roseanne and Darlene step all over Dan and David respectively. After the girl basically bosses D.J. into going to Chicago with her without permission, Dan and Roseanne actually sit him down and explain that it is <em>not</em> okay for him to let someone control his life like that, and he needs to break it off with a girl if she tries it. Naturally, after the talk is over, Roseanne refuses to practice what she preaches and keeps treating Dan the same way she always does.<ul><li> However, David later reveals the real reason D.J. is dating her is because she slips him the tongue. Of course, he's not gonna tell his parents that.</li></ul></li><li> Another episode talked about this. Jackie went on a date (although nothing sexual happened) with another man while she was married to Fred. When they separated for a few days, Roseanne made it her priority to get Fred to move back into the house and pull Jackie out of her depression (by telling her it wasn't her fault). When Dan saw how hurt Fred was at this betrayal of trust, he confronted Roseanne for blaming everyone except Jackie for what she did.</li><li> Darlene is also no slouch in this department. Ironically, it's often Roseanne who ends up reminding her to tell David she does really love him every now and then.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unishment">Unishment</a>: The suit-and-tie example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a> was used because grounding DJ would have been pointless, as "he never goes anywhere."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VacationEpisode">Vacation Episode</a>: Dan and Roseanne went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VivaLasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VivaLasVegas">Las Vegas</a> for one episode.<ul><li> In "Lose a Job, Winnabego" they invite themselves along on the neighbours' trip to California (another invention of Roseanne's; they were originally going to Branson, Missouri).</li><li> And two episodes in Disney World.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> : Several.

When David tries to come back and make amends, Dan refuses to allow David to even see his children until he's actually moved back into Lanford. This is very likely due to David's behavior striking a major nerve with Dan, as Dan's father also estranged himself from his wife and son, and then proceeded to show up sporadically, pretend he was a great dad for a few days, before leaving again.
