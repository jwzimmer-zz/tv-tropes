Probably the best drug use humor ever used on any TV show. Even though it was never (explicitly) stated what they were really doing down there, you can pretty much guess (the camera in the circle represented the "item" being passed around).

The episode is even titled "Donna's Panties."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife">Ugly Guy, Hot Wife</a>: Bob &amp; Midge, and later Bob &amp; Jackie's mom Pam. Eric &amp; Donna are portrayed as this, with characters frequently commenting on the relationship as such. Averted with Bob's relationship with the more average Joanne, with whom he's more evenly matched, just after Midge leaves.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a>: Subverted in that Eric is this to Red, while Laurie is this to Kitty. Overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> as it is frequently shown that Red is hard on Eric because he cares. Being a product of his time, Red would probably believe that it would be important to teach his son self-sufficiency while his daughter would eventually be taken care of by her husband. As the series progresses Red becomes increasingly less tolerant of Laurie's ungrateful mooching behavior, but he never tries to teach her how to become a productive member of society, he just enjoys her prolonged absences. Once when she returned Red reacted by saying "We gotta start locking that door."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryMakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryMakeover">Unnecessary Makeover</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, Donna and Jackie give one to Big Rhonda in "Red And Stacey", in time for Rhonda's date with Fez.

When Fez's friend from his country comes to visit he never calls Fez by any name.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusualEuphemism">Unusual Euphemism</a>: "Dillhole".<ul><li> After listening to George Carlin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDirtyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDirtyWords">Seven Dirty Words</a> album, Eric decides to create a system for using the words in public by numbering them. Unfortunately, only about half of what he says makes sense when taking the original order of Carlin&#146;s list into account.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedGiftPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedGiftPlot">Unwanted Gift Plot</a>: Donna gives Eric a "man ring." Said ring is huge and gaudy and promptly stolen by Fez.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UptownGirl">Uptown Girl</a>: Jackie is a rich girl and cheerleader, Hyde is a poor delinquent with a messed up family who lives with Eric's family because he has nowhere else to go. Initially Hyde stated their differences in social status as a reason they shouldn't go out: they had nothing in common.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UranusIsShowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UranusIsShowing">Uranus Is Showing</a>: Kelso has his UFO pictures developed, only for his friends to find out later that there were naked pictures of him on the same roll. Fez's response:<div class="indent"><strong>Fez</strong>: I don't see a UFO, but I can definitely see Uranus.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVamp">The Vamp</a>: Laurie, Eric's slutty older sister, is nicknamed "the witch" and "the Devil".<div class="indent"><strong>Red</strong>: Eric, what have I told you about calling your sister "The Devil"? <br><strong>Eric</strong>: It's offensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultToRocks">to the Devil</a>?</div><ul><li> Played hilariously in one episode where the family is playing a game called <em>Church</em> Rummy with the Youth Minister at their church and Laurie shows her cards: 6, 6, and 6.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VandalismBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VandalismBackfire">Vandalism Backfire</a>: After Jackie breaks up with him, Kelso tries writing a song to win her back. Eventually, he annoys Eric into taking his guitar and smashing it.<div class="indent"><strong>Eric</strong>: Well, isn't that funny? <br><strong>Kelso</strong>: You know what's even funnier? That was <em>your</em> guitar! Burn!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">Verbal Tic</a>: Leo ends most of his sentences with the word "man".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>: The first-run promos on Fox for the episode "Happy Jack" advertised the episode as one of these. This was the episode where Donna caught Eric masturbating and everybody made his life hell, so these promos were both a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope">parody</a> of the very special episode trope.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>:<ul><li> Hyde has this sort of relationship with all his close friends, Kelso in particular.</li><li> Red and Eric are always at each others' throats with their constant snarking, but it's been shown that they really do care about each other.</li><li> Let's not forget Donna and Jackie. Donna is amazed and a little horrified when she realizes they've become friends, and Jackie never lets up making fun of Donna's shoe size or calling her a lumberjack.</li><li> Red and Bob's relationship is kinda like this but it's mostly one-way with Red frequently insulting Bob. Bob does take shots at Red sometimes but it's rare.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalDissonance">Vocal Dissonance</a>: In the musical episode, all the characters sound like themselves while singing, except for Donna and Jackie, who, in a case of <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">Special Effects Failure</a> as well, sound totally different.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime">Webcomic Time</a>: The show was on for eight years, though in-universe only 4 years passed. The show was set in 1976 for the first 12 episodes, 1977 until the end of the third season, 1978 until early in season 6, and 1979 for the rest of the series.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">"Well Done, Son!" Guy</a>:<ul><li> Eric and Red. Red once said that, as Eric's father, it was his job to make Eric a man, "which he's not."</li><li> A female version of this trope occurs with Kitty both as a mother and as a daughter. Kitty has a very strained relationship with her daughter Laurie due to the fact that Laurie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">Really Gets Around</a> and can't seem to do anything constructive with her life. Grandma Bea, Kitty's mother, also uses her razor-sharp <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> abilities to mercilessly insult Kitty and everything she tries to do. Kitty even cited the similarities between Laurie and Grandma Bea as proof that "evil skips a generation."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamLine">Wham Line</a>: Kelso spends "The Acid Queen" insisting he and Brooke slept together, but she denies it, so the others think he's lying or confused. When she later admits it did happen, Kelso gloats to the others until she explains why she just admitted it.<div class="indent"><strong>Brooke</strong>: Michael, I just found out I'm pregnant.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>: In one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a>, Eric is supposed to direct a "Birth of Christ" pageant, but the others goof off and won't follow his directions. After Pastor Dave fires Eric and takes over, they respond by tying Dave up in Christmas lights. By this point, <em>Leo</em> calls them out on their behavior.<div class="indent"><strong>Leo</strong>: I can't believe you guys. You've managed to bring a man of God to tears. <br><strong>Dave</strong>: I'm not crying. <br><strong>Leo</strong>: I'm talkin' about me, man. You know, you guys can hassle your skinny friend Eric, but when it comes down to a fundamental moral core, he's the only one of you that's got one. So congratulations, you've ruined Christmas.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDidWeGoWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereDidWeGoWrong">Where Did We Go Wrong?</a>: Mostly Red's attitude toward Eric but even Kitty seems to question him at times. Kitty also tends to feel this way about Laurie in general.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where The Hell Is Point Place?</a>: Point Place was never given a specific location within the state of Wisconsin&mdash;sometimes it was stated they were in the "Greater Kenosha Area", sometimes they were close to Green Bay (especially when Red, Eric and the gang went to a Packers game), sometimes they were closer to Milwaukee. Chicago was also referenced a few times (it's where Kelso moved to in the final season), so that doesn't really help anything. The old Fox website said it was set in the fictional "Greater Oshkosh Area" (supported by a line of dialogue Kelso has in the early episode "Date Night"), and Bonnie Turner based it off a section of Toledo, Ohio (where she grew up) called Point Place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">Wild Teen Party</a>: "'Burning Down The House." When Kelso invites Hyde and Fez over to Jackie's house for a party, the party quickly becomes one of these.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a>: Lampshaded by Hyde after Eric and Donna first had sex.<div class="indent"><strong>Hyde</strong>: Good, I couldn't take one more week of that 'will they, won't they' crap.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">With Friends Like These...</a>:<ul><li> Eric's friends, especially Hyde, are also his perdition.</li><li> Also, Donna and Jackie, but theirs is much milder compared to what the guys have...</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkInfoTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkInfoTitle">Work Info Title</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfSnark">World of Snark</a>: It's hard to find characters who don't fit the pattern. Eric <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarks</a>. Donna snarks (especially at Jackie). Hyde does almost nothing <em>but</em> snark. Eventually Fez snarks a lot too. Laurie snarks. Red snarks. Kitty slips her snarks in almost under the radar. Jackie and Kelso, on the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">don't seem to grasp sarcasm</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Wrench Wench</a>: In the episode "Career Day", Jackie shows unexpected skill in fixing cars, earning Red's respect.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">Written-In Absence</a>: When the Formans and the Pinciottis first met, both Laurie and Midge were absent. While there was no explanation for Laurie's absence, Bob did mention that Midge got her finger stuck in something.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>: Played straight and subverted with Fez's girlfriend Caroline. She acts like this when they date, but once Donna flat-out says Fez doesn't like her and Fez admits it nervously, Caroline takes it very calmly and just leaves. Doubly subverted in her appearances in season eight, where she's still crazy.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouJustToldMe">You Just Told Me</a>:<ul><li> Red pulls one on Eric during the episode where he thinks his son's taken up smoking.<div class="indent"><strong>Red</strong>: You lied when you said you weren't going to take the car out of town... <br><strong>Eric</strong>: You knew about that?! <br><strong>Red</strong>: I do now! Hah!</div></li><li> Done with Eric and Laurie.<div class="indent"><strong>Eric</strong>: I'll tell Dad that you're flunking out of college. <br><strong>Laurie</strong>: *gasp* How did you know? <br><strong>Eric</strong>: I didn't! *laughs*</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMakeupIsRunning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMakeupIsRunning">Your Makeup Is Running</a>: In one episode Jackie puts some makeup on Kelso, telling him it'll make him look better. Eventually it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedIntoDrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedIntoDrag">gets out of hand</a>. When he meets up with the guys later, it's revealed that he's forgotten to remove all of it, and he's informed that his mascara is running.</li></ul></div><hr><dl><dd><div class="indent"><em><strong>HELLO WISCONSIN!</strong></em></div></dd></dl>
