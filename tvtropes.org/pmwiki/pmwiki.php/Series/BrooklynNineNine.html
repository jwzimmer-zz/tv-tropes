It is explained; the other members of the squad note that while Boyle is undeniably clumsy, he's a 'grinder' who works very hard to overcome his shortcomings rather than it just coming naturally. Unlike Peralta and the other detectives, Boyle doesn't have a slump because he just keeps working until he's done.</li><li> On more than one occasion, Scully and Hitchcock solve a case while the others are distracted.

We see a flashback to young Holt requesting the money to do so from the precinct, only for the rest of his precinct to fall about the place laughing derisively.

He twice connects with women over food, too: his ex-fiancee Vivian and partner Genevieve are both food obsessed as well.</li><li> Boyle has numerous family members who all have weird habits, weirder than Boyle. Many of his male family members have traditionally feminine names, e.g. Becca, Pam or Lynn.</li><li> In the second season, whenever the subject turns to romance between the detectives Boyle is constantly advising that washing your partner's hair is the most romantic thing you can do.</li><li> Boyle ships Amy and Jake, at times rather inappropriately, e.g. him pushing them to have children asap.</li><li> The members of the Nine-Nine using bird-calls to 'secretly' communicate with each other while enacting their various schemes.

When Nikolaj's bio dad appears, he's not satisfied with Charles' pronunciation of the name either.</li><li> Whenever gay Captain Holt plays a straight character (e.g. when he's undercover), he will fixate on breasts and describe them in elaborate detail.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh">Canada, Eh?</a> is often brought up, either as a nice place, but more likely as the butt of jokes.

He will casually bring up horrible experiences from his years spent undercover among mafia or hiding abroad and sometimes he will refer to them as fun, like getting mugged in Argentina; next minute, he will scream that they have no idea what it's like to have to eat your own toe as a loyalty test.</li><li> Teddy is the most boring man in America. His only interest is drinking pilsners, making pilsners, bottling pilsners, talking about pilsners...</li><li> When Rosa dates Jocelyn who is at cosmetology school, she lets her do her make-up and, later, hair. Most noticeable in episode "The Crime Scene" (6.06) where she has a different haircut for each scene; some nice and understated, but usually it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagHaircut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagHaircut">Gag Haircut</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltAndPepper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaltAndPepper">Salt and Pepper</a>:<ul><li> They're not partners, but Holt (straight-laced African American) and Peralta (irreverent white guy) otherwise have the contemporary inversion of this dynamic.</li><li> Peralta and Santiago are a Cafe Con Leche combination despite the fact that Peralta is a typically Spanish last name (although it's quite common in Italy as well).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityBall">Sanity Ball</a>: The role of straight man is passed around a lot, primarily between Terry, Holt, Amy, and Rosa.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>: While interviewing IT consultants, Gina repeatedly asks one what his favourite Jay-Z song is until he yells at her, she screams at another and flosses in front of the third. It turns out she was secretly pitting them against challenges they'd be facing every day: handling Hitchcock's daily questions about logging in, Rosa's constant angry outbursts, and the general disgusting nature of a police station that has to deal with both criminals and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Hitchcock and Scully</a>.

No matter what they're like otherwise, all Boyle cousins have an intense fondness for beige clothing and use "I love you" like punctuation.</li><li> Season 2 shows beyond a doubt that Boyle and Gina are both essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">Generation Xerox</a> of their same-sex parent, though Gina's mother is arguably a bit more mellow than her daughter.</li><li> Holt and his mother are both high-powered, extremely stoic people involved in law enforcement.

Unfortunately, not only does Peralta take the death threat a mite more seriously than Holt expects, but the position of Holt's bodyguard comes with numerous ways of asserting authority over Holt that Peralta is unable to pass up, thus providing more of an imposition on Holt.

All the detectives have a desk in the bullpen and their direct superior Captain Holt has a small office.

He is fussy, neat, and cultured, for example, and is an amazing ballroom dancer. Not to mention the pride flag on his desk. He is, in fact, the head of a gay police officer's advocacy group, and has been out since the 1970s. When his sexuality was revealed in the first episode, the joke was not, as with many of these characters, simply that the character was unexpectedly gay, but that all the professional detectives that work under him didn't notice the really obvious signs.

What he doesn't realize is that when the team successfully catches the murderer, it's such a masterful collar that Wuntch uses as an opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">"promote"</a> Holt to the department of public relations. Either way, Wuntch comes out on top.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a>:<ul><li> Santiago is impressed by Holt and has adopted him as her 'rabbi'. So far, this appears to involve copious amounts of unprompted sucking up on her part.</li><li> Boyle also has a tendency to act like this to everyone, especially Peralta and Rosa. It's lampshaded in "Halloween" (1.06) when, faced with his team's skepticism about whether he'll be able to win his bet with Holt, Peralta protests that they're normally telling him he's the best. After a moment's thought, he realizes that it actually only ever seems to be Boyle who keeps telling him this. In "Thanksgiving" (1.10), Boyle admits that he's a chronic people-pleaser and that "it's a serious problem."</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr>
