At the same time, the show has branched off from focusing on Nick as the central character into more of a ensemble feel by giving other characters more screen time and involvement in various plots. Not a surprising development, since the show was co-created by two alumni of influential and famously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a>- and ensemble-heavy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>There was a web series to hold fans over during the off season (winter hiatus 2012-2013).

Renard's family want <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the key/map Aunt Marie gave Nick</span> so they can find an ancient artifact. Renard seems to have his own agenda that might not exactly match that of his relatives.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a>: All Wesen can show one, though the extent of their change ('woging') and whether humans can see it depends heavily on individual master and emotional state. Wesen with greater mastery over woging can invoke a broader spectrum of change and even change some or all of themselves on demand while those with less mastery are more at the whims of their emotional state. Regardless of whether they're showing, wesen retain many of their physical abilities, such as strength and toughness, while claws and more monstrous abilities are unavailable unless they woge. Wesen also have no innate ability to detect other wesen other than seeing another wesen woge. This hasn't always turned out well for those that pick on the wrong wesen. The woge will come through on visual media (such as films or videos) but only those who can see it directly can perceive it in the recording.<ul><li> Adalind and Monroe, both of whom regularly engage in non-human activities, demonstrate considerable physical ability with no transformations while the family of bears (who have suppressed their non-human natures) seem to prefer transformation for any sort of show of ability.</li><li> Nick and the other Grimms are not shown to have telltale physical traits themselves, but can see a wesen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a> regardless of whether an individual wants them to or not, which is one of many reasons wesen fear Grimms. Because of the reaction Nick and other Grimms have to seeing a wesen woge, most wesen can identify them as a Grimm if they're watching someone when they woge. On the flip side, this also means that wesen can occasionally mistake someone for or not realize that someone is a Grimm.<ul><li> "Synchronicity" finally reveals just how Wesen identify a Grimm. Monroe and Rosalee explain that upon seeing a Wesen woge, a Grimm's eyes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackEyesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackEyesOfEvil">turn utterly, infinitely black</a>, and the Wesen sees its own true nature reflected back at them from those eyes&mdash;a deeply unsettling experience for the Wesen. This explains why all the Wesen Nick has encountered have failed to recognize him as a Grimm until after <em>he</em> recognizes <em>them</em> by seeing them woge. This explains why Trubel starts wearing sunglasses when trailing a Wesen: so that she can recognize them, but they would be unable to recognize her as a Grimm.</li></ul></li><li> Non-Grimms/non-wesen can also see a wesen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a> if the wesen in question wants them to or they're in a high enough emotional state. However, Monroe points out that doing so is usually a bad thing if only because humans generally aren't prepared for the sudden shock to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">Weirdness Censor</a>. Some wesen deliberately show their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a> to their human prey in order to panic them.</li><li> Monroe elaborates further for Hank; a normal change as a sign of recognition among wesen can't be seen by humans; an aggressive fighting mode game face is readily apparent. He demonstrates: Hank doesn't see the first change, but sees the second... and is equal parts freaked out and impressed. <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments">And then wonderingly asks Monroe to do it again.</a><ul><li> Also, as Hank demonstrates in later episodes of Season 2, it's possible for a normal human to build up tolerance to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a>. Contrast Hank's first exposure to a wesen, and how he freaked out at Carly's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a>, to how calm and confident he is when facing the wesen in "Nameless".</li></ul></li><li> Wesen law prohibits the deliberate showing of a Wesen's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameFace">Game Face</a> to humans in a public setting for personal gain. In the past these types of deliberate provocations resulted in witch hunts and massacres of Wesen by humans. The breaking of this law is considered one of the worst transgressions a Wesen can commit against other Wesen and is punished by death.<ul><li> This is one of the purposes of the Wesen Council, whose leader mentions once that an attempt to violate the law happens once a generation by some of the younger Wesen who consider these laws ancient and obsolete. A public display is usually engineered by the Council to scare the rest into submission.</li></ul></li><li> Another episode shows what happens when a Wesen goes "full woge" frequently. His control over his abilities (or his sanity) starts to slip, and he can woge without meaning to and go on a rampage.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">Gender-Blender Name</a>: Kelly Burkhardt, the name of Nick's mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and his son, who was named after her</span>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreBlind">Genre Blind</a>: Nick.

Long enough in the past to be fairly mysterious but not so long ago as to prevent much older things from existing and having been established elsewhere.<ul><li> We also find out what the Grimms were called before the brothers made the name synonymous with "Wesen-hunter".

By the second season, it's clear that the conflict is very convoluted and not nearly as straight forward.<ul><li> Unlike many universes, there's actually a formal Masquerade in play that was written and codified by a meeting of all wesens across the world sometime around the 13th century with jurisdiction over it given to a Wesen Council. Breaking of it is grounds for death as previous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenMasquerade">Broken Masquerades</a> resulted in things like the Witch Trials.</li><li> The penalty of death is also distinct among Masquerades since the punishment is not dealt to witnesses but to those that broke the masquerade.

The irony of the situation is that this is a universe with dragons who can breathe fire, ogres who are almost impervious to normal weapons, and satyrs that can charm you with their touch.

"Schade" however means "It's a pity" (but still derives from "Schaden"). To wit, "schade" is 1st person singular present indicative of "schaden" (as in "I harm/damage").<ul><li> The Austrians and the Gypsies prefer the German pronunciation, even scolding Adalind for using the Americanized pronunciation.</li></ul></li><li> "Mar&eacute;chauss&eacute;e" refers to the French spelling of the Marechaussee in the Netherlands, which is a gendarmerie in its function.

To most Wesen Grimm's are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a>, to some (mostly the more martial species) however there the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a>, likewise a small number of Wesen have had semi-positive historical relationship with Grimm's (such as Melifer's). Where as historically most Grimm's saw Wesen as dangerous, monstrous or even outright unworthy of life itself, some however where more tolerant and even sympathetic. Likewise its clear from Nick's journal diaries, that previous Grimms range from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmour">Knight in Sour Armour</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleBigot">Noble Bigot</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter">The Witch Hunter</a>, genocidal murders and everything in between.

Even the peaceful Monroe is capable of ripping a man's arm off without much effort. In "Bears Will Be Bears", this happens to three different groups of human criminals. Even those species that aren't gifted with physical capabilities or supernatural abilities tend to have quirks that make them hard to deal with. The mouse creature in "Of Mouse and Man" is shown crawling through small spaces far faster and better than a human could.</li><li> The same holds true for anyone who's just an asshole to a Wesen. The elitists of the Van-Hamlin Institute treat the scholarship student, who got in on talent and nothing else, like trash and attempt to toss him out at the first opportunity. As expected, when they push him too far and hurt someone he loves, they get hurt in return curacy of his gifts as a Reinigen.</li><li> Played with when Wesen attempt to fight Nick, as <em>he</em> is the monster that <em>they</em> fear. Given that he's been revealed to be stronger than Monroe (who can rip a man's arm off), this starts to make sense.</li><li> A milder, more comedic example shows up in <em>La Llorona</em>, when some young bullies smash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredMonster">harmless</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolfMan">eccentric</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Mr. Monroe</a>'s window because he stopped them from picking on a smaller girl.
