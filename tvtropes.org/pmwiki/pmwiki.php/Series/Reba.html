Van really cannot pass up on drinking too much.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: In an episode of Season 3, Kyra gets fed up with her father and stepmother's constant arguing and runs away. They confront her mother Reba on her rebellious behavior and Reba tells them that Kyra's not in her house either. All three parental guardians start to panic on where else could Kyra have disappeared to... Until she's revealed to have been taking refuge in Reba's house all that time.<ul><li> In Season 5, Van's playing hide-and-seek with his daughter Elizabeth.

Cheyenne and Van are hurt by her calling their daughter Elizabeth this and they call her out on it, though she denies it at first and this prompts them to move out. Van and Cheyenne also admit that their daughter was unplanned but they love their daughter nonetheless.<div class="indent"><strong>Reba:</strong> I will not let you throw your lives and the rest of this family into chaos again!

Barbra Jean's attempt at making Cheyenne feel better does no favor for the latter.<div class="indent"><strong>Barbra Jean</strong>: Don't get upset, Cheyenne.

Van goes through a crisis of faith after an injury derails his lifelong goal of being a pro football player, and he says outright he no longer believes in God. This horrifies his very conservative family, especially Barbra Jean. She brings the Bible to him, saying she found a passage that might help him.<div class="indent"><strong>Barbra Jean</strong>: If you look here at Matthew 12 Verse 3 "And Jesus says unto his disciples..." <em>[closes the book and starts beating him with it]</em> What is wrong with you, boy?! Do you want to spend eternity in a fiery damnation?!</div><ul><li> And a second later, we saw where she got the idea.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Reba</strong>: Barbra Jean, you're not gonna get anybody to believe by hitting them with a Bible.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Barbra Jean</strong>: Oh, that's how my daddy did it.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulWeddedLife">Awful Wedded Life</a>: Really all over the place:<ul><li> In the last few seasons, Brock and Barbra Jean had their marriage collapse. He moved back out, they were constantly arguing, and Brock felt the only real way to salvage it was to pull <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBabyTrap">The Baby Trap</a> on Barbra Jean (having his vasectomy reversed without telling her.)</li><li> Any real mention of Reba and Brock's marriage implied it was pretty bad as well, especially during the end. Alongside Brock's infidelity, Brock frequently skipped out on his and Reba's marriage counseling appointments, Reba was put on anti-depressants, and she talks so badly about the end of their marriage, you almost wonder why she didn't thank Barbra Jean for putting their marriage out of its misery.</li><li> Back in the first seasons, Brock and BJ go and visit BJ's father, "Big Daddy." He takes a superior attitude with Brock for leaving his first wife, and says that Big Daddy and his wife were married for over 50 years... "mostly because she's too ugly to kiss goodbye." Brock calls him out on this, saying that yes, he's divorced, but he would never talk that way about his wife.</li><li> In all honesty, the healthiest marriage on this show was Van and Cheyenne, believe it or not, who seemed rather stable under all their arguing.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a>: Van and Cheyenne. They argue often, but there's no question about the authenticity of their love. One episode during Season 5 has each of them two taking turns complaining about the other in a therapist's office, embracing each other when they finish, and then getting told off for arguing soon after (in the waiting area of said therapist's office <em>and</em> at the parking lot outside).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>, it's not so much "berserk" as "reacting strongly".<ul><li> In one episode, Reba and Van see a therapist named David. It's "David", not "Dave"!

Barbra Jean (frequently referred to by her initials) was also a huge Jesus Freak. Cheyenne was more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, with Kyra even mentioning that she gets good grades.

Though the show never fully abandoned plot and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, Cheyenne and Barbara Jean's pregnancies gave the season a strong, contained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> rather than the more episodic nature of the later seasons. Finally, the show was generally much more serious and grounded, as the Hart family tried to navigate through Cheyenne's pregnancy and the Harts' divorce around ultra-conservative neighbors, school principals, etc. Much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>, the show kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderized</a> into more of a live-action cartoon and chose to emphasize comedy over drama.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingMiddleName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingMiddleName">Embarrassing Middle Name</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Punny Name</a>: Brock <em>Enrol</em> Hart.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassinglyPainfulSunburn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassinglyPainfulSunburn">Embarrassingly Painful Sunburn</a>: At the end of the fifth-season episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DietEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DietEpisode">Have Your Cake</a>", Reba suffers from this (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanLines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanLines">Tan Lines</a> and all) during the trip she and Barbra Jean take to a beach.<div class="indent"><strong>Cheyenne</strong>: Mom, are you OK?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Reba</strong>: Barbra Jean was supposed to wake me up.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Barbra Jean</strong>: Well, I was doing a sand sculpture of you, and it's easier to do if you don't move.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Reba</strong>: Well, thanks to you, I look ridiculous.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>:<ul><li> A snarky couple with three children: A ditzy blonde who married a doofus, a snarky middle child who seems to be the only verbal equal to the snarky matriarch, and a young son who everyone seems to forget about.

She mentioned that after some money that was raised to send her on a school trip to England had to be given to Cheyenne instead because she had dropped so many classes, she ran the risk of losing Elizabeth's spot in the school day care if she didn't enroll in summer school. Interestingly, in a rare case of this, Reba is painfully aware of it (most cases of this trope will have the parents be oblivious), as Reba told both Cheyenne and Kyra in a couple of gut-wrenching speeches.

A person named Terry is the top bidder. It turns out that Terry is a man. A very effeminate man who mentions having a "partner". When Van confronts Terry about the issue, Terry becomes offended and tells Van that he's not gay, with the partner he was referring to being a business partner and that he was married to a former Miss Houston. He then tells Van that he thought <em>Van</em> was gay. Phew.</li><li> Reba herself gets stuck with this trope in Season four episode "Van's Agent". Van makes an offensive joke about gay people in front of his lesbian sports agent, Sadie Owens, and to cover it up, he tells her that Reba is "super gay". When Sadie meets the family, Reba asks the agent if they can "hang out" which Sadie thinks is Reba asking her out, especially since Reba said she was lonely because her (platonic) girlfriend moved away.</li><li> This happens in yet another episode called "Parenting With Puppets" with Brock and Van, during which a male masseuse at a day spa mistakenly perceives them as a gay couple because Brock says that Henry and Elizabeth have "two great dads who love them".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForRacist">Mistaken for Racist</a>: In "No Good Deed," Barbra Jean dressing and talking like a stereotypical black person comes across as racist to the 20 black people she invited without permission to Reba's house.

By the time the video clip sequence ends, Reba is calmly sipping tea, grinning and giggling happily, before muttering to herself: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">I'm definitely relaxed now.</a>"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksgivingEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThanksgivingEpisode">Thanksgiving Episode</a>: Two episodes are related to this holiday.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>: Brock delivers one to Kyra when she disobeys her mother and attends a unsupervised boy-girl party in Season 3.<div class="indent"><strong>Reba:</strong> You don't even check in with me!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Kyra:</strong> Because I live with Dad now, and I don't have to do all that stuff!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Brock:</strong> Oh yes, you do.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Kyra:</strong> What?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Brock:</strong> From now on, you have to check in with both me and your mother. <em>(Reba looks at Kyra; Kyra sighs in disbelief)</em> Look, maybe you'd thought you'd have it easy living with me, because Dad's a pushover. Well, let me tell you something. Living with me isn't going to be a free ride, and it isn't a license to cut your mother out of your life either!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Kyra:</strong> Well, that's not fair!</div><div class="indent"><strong>Brock:</strong> Well, good. Then I must be doing something "right". Now go say goodnight to your friends.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Kyra:</strong> I can't believe this! <em>(Walks away)</em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTuneCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTuneCameo">Theme Tune Cameo</a>: We catch Barbra Jean singing the eponymous chorus line of "I'm a Survivor."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave">The Thing That Would Not Leave</a>:<ul><li> Reba saw almost everybody like this, notably Brock and <strong>especially</strong> Barbra Jean, who seemed to have no concept of personal boundaries (Barbra Jean has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSenseOfPersonalSpace">No Sense of Personal Space</a> that she just gets inside the house at nighttime hours when she sees so much as a light and even entered once <em>through the window</em>). There were the occasional whispers that she felt this way about Van and Cheyenne as well. While she loved them dearly and cared for them unconditionally, she occasionally mentioned how she hoped that they would get their situation straightened out (and therefore move) sooner rather than later.</li><li> Reba herself starts to become this towards Van and Cheyenne when they finally settle in their own house. It was partly justified since they were weirdos.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Theme Tune Title Drop</a>:<ul><li> The last line of the series is "Cause we're survivors."</li><li> During the fifth-season finale, Reba is faced with the prospect of a surgery.

In the latest seasons, her reason for changing studies from dentistry to elderly caretaker (which then makes her want to become a drug counselor later on) stern from the fact an old lady came rushing at her while driving...right before Cheyenne casually mentions, "so I hung up the phone and..."</li><li> During the first season, Reba, acting as a respectable substitute teacher, counseled a young couple of friends to Cheyenne and Van about how extremely difficult it is to raise a child while still being in high school as they saw it very fun and manageable seeing Van and Cheyenne making it (all because Reba decided to support them). Despite all the warnings (and Van and Cheyenne's utter lack of common sense), the young couple ends up being caught about to have sex that same night.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a>:<ul><li> Based on various dialogue, Van loves pizza.</li><li> Mac and cheese wheels for Kyra.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoSigning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickedIntoSigning">Tricked Into Signing</a>: Barbra Jean was fooled into signing excused absence slips by Kyra, who pretended she wanted her autograph.
