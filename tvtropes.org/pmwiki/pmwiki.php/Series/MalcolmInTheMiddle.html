The show follows his attempts to keep his head down and get through life despite the social stigma of being "smart" and the rest of his family: his sociopathic brothers, consisting of oldest brother Francis (who was shipped off to military school and often has his own B-plot in an episode), next oldest brother Reese (dense and violent school bully) and younger brother Dewey (self-sufficient and almost unflappable amidst all the chaos, and possibly even smarter than Malcom). Their behavior has rubbed off on Malcolm himself, and a newborn, Jamie, was born later in the show's run (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">with hints he may become the most conniving of all the kids</a>).

When Dewey was scared of letting go of the rope swing into the lake while the family was on vacation, Lois just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">threw rocks at him</a> in order to get him to come down to dinner &mdash; and that's not even getting into some of the stories Francis tells. Of her bad relationship with Francis, she claims "he started it", because of a time he ignored her when he was a newborn. It should be no surprise that his first words to her were "You shut up!"</li><li> When left alone with the kids, Hal's constant attempts to make Lois' night a peaceful one get him in a state of paranoia in which he wavers all the way between being the best dad ever and a horrible troll.</li><li> Lois' mother Ida is a racist, small-minded, controlling <em>lunatic</em> who constantly belittles her daughters and holds lifelong grudges for trivial offenses against nearly everyone in the family. She is obsessed with "the old country", which seems to be some lawless part of Eastern Europe, and once tries to make Reese marry a foreign girl after going through trials, one of which was beating up Malcolm, whom she has a low opinion of because she is anti-intellectual. Every Christmas, she buys the presents for the family that they all wanted just so she can <em>not</em> send them, making Francis consider her to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">insane.</a> The family hates her so much they generally stop their infighting whenever she comes around in order to focus on getting rid of her.</li><li> Hal's father was mostly unintentionally neglectful and not out of malice. He is an eccentric millionaire and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> who didn't spend enough time being a father to Hal, instead engaging in a number of wacky schemes and shenanigans. Hal's fear of becoming this to his own kids becomes a major plot device in the episode where his father dies.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcmeProducts">Acme Products</a>: Episode 4 has the kids and Hal dump a box of confetti supplied by ACME Party Supplies into a woodchipper.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalHero">Accidental Hero</a>: "Boys at Ranch" had the boy's fireworks show a drunk and lost Hal and Otto the way back home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquaintedWithEmergencyServices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquaintedWithEmergencyServices">Acquainted with Emergency Services</a>:<ul><li> In one episode, Reese comes home pursued by the police. When his parents notice the sirens, Lois decides to start making coffee. Then Hal notes that the policeman is a guy called Hank, who only drinks decaffeinated coffee.</li><li> In one episode, Malcolm is taken to the hospital to treat a serious head injury; the hospital is already familiar with Malcolm and all his brothers, and are not pleased to see them, as they have a history with their idiotic injuries.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: Played with. On the one hand, rarely are the show's various authority figures (Lois, Commandant Spangler, Mr. Herkabe, the police...) able to keep the boys in check. Then again, occasionally the boys manage to manipulate an adult into being useful after all (one memorable example being when they guilted Caroline into paying for Malcolm's hospital visit).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedComputer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedComputer">The Alleged Computer</a>: Exaggerated. One of the family's neighbors gives the boys his "old laptop" in exchange for Malcolm helping him set up his new computer. His old laptop turns out to be one of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq_Portable">luggables<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> from the 80s.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>: Dewey convinces Malcolm that his 'perfect bed' was this. Additionally, Hal once ate too many deep-fried twinkies and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">had the weirdest dream...</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyMom">Almighty Mom</a>: Lois has her moments, the best example probably being her reaction to Reese joining the army and getting sent to Afghanistan. She manages to bully the details of the mission out of a general, and the next we see of her she's set herself up as the leader of a gang of Afghan militants, who seem to be terrified of her.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a>: Child prodigy Barton appears in Malcolm's class for a while &mdash; his brain is "like a beehive, and every bee has a brain like yours". However, Herkabe's pressuring him causes him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">quit at the end of the episode</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents">Amazingly Embarrassing Parents</a>:<ul><li> Hal and Lois both have moments when they embody this perfectly. For example, in the bowling episode, Lois insists on being the chaperone of the group of kids bowling with Malcolm and Reese and she even forces Malcolm to use a kids' ball.</li><li> Stevie's parents, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">his mother</a>. Exacto Knives are 'no-nos' for her. The two of them never let him grow up or do anything fun and even conditioned him to go to bed at <em>6:30</em> when he's 12 (Malcolm notes not even 4 year olds go to bed that early). Ultimately, Stevie's mother <em>broke</em> when Stevie showed he could be independent, and she <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">left the family</a>.</li><li> Getting Malcolm nicknamed "Stain" for the rest of his high school career by noting loudly that there's a stain on Malcolm's pants, then loudly shouting details about it as she moves to wipe it off. In the school courtyard. While the whole school is gathered there for orientation and textbook distribution. Lois even stormily asks a nearby classmate "Would YOU be embarrassed by this?" who then simply wordlessly shakes his head and backs a little further away.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>:<ul><li> Dabney and Lloyd - the two effeminate classmates.</li><li> In one episode, Jessica convinces both Malcolm and Reese that the other is gay. For Malcolm, she uses a detailed argument noting Reese's spotty interest in women, his collection of men's bodybuilding magazines, and his love of cooking. When the brothers confront each other about it, both deny it but Reese says he bought Malcolm some gay porn - making sure to go through several collections thoroughly for the best stuff. Seeing how he showed interest in girls, he might be more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBi">Ambiguously Bi</a> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>.</li><li> In another episode, a group of neighboring siblings that have been bullying them edit a gay porn video placing Malcolm's, Dewey's and Reese's faces on the guys from the video. Reese is enraged about it - but only because the guy his face was placed on has less toned abs.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: In the last episode, Lois reveals that her plan all along (and apparently that of the whole family) was to make Malcolm miserable so he would stop being such an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> and use his talent to help people. "Adversity builds character" is a running theme throughout the show, it's just easy to ignore. Also counts as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">Broken Aesop</a>, given that all the adversity was artificial.

Later episodes drop this, with nudity being mostly restricted to being in the shower or similar.</li><li> In the pilot, Malcolm had a friend named Richard who walked with him to school; he was never seen or mentioned in any other episode (though it's likely he stopped talking to Malcolm after he became a Krelboyne.)<ul><li> Also in the pilot, it seemed it was planned for Malcolm to wrap up the episode in the credits roll with a summary of what happened afterwards.

When we cut back to present day Hal, he mentions that wasn't even the low point of that day.</li><li> This actually happens a lot to the kids, but specially to Reese later in the series. These fails include being trapped in the roof while receiving a rain of putrid projectiles from the Krelboynes, ending up sleeping in a friend's dilapidated basement and almost losing an eye, being trapped under debris with fireworks exploding in their face, burning horribly in the sun, being attacked by wild animals, entering a military field during bombing tests and the list goes on and on.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingWar">Escalating War</a>: An entire episode starts in the middle of one.

To Malcolm and Reese, it's like Dewey is speaking a foreign language and they can't even comprehend the link between getting in trouble and getting punished. Malcolm sort of <em>seems</em> to get the idea, but then goes into immediate denial and looks for another answer. However, Lois has also mentioned that she regularly treats one of her sons better then the other so that the other two don&#146;t know what&#146;s going on, and given her track record for punishing her kids even when they really haven't done anything wrong...</li><li> In "Mono", Reese observes that Jamie acts as Dewey's "slave" and claims Jamie for himself (Dewey was his slave before he started showing spite).

After Dewey slowly guides him through asking for a soda, Reese finds it disgusting because he had to ask nicely for it, and comes to the realization that he only likes having a slave who suffers under his demands.

When she returned the next day and found that Francis wasn&#146;t miserable without her, she preceded to spend the next year torturing him as revenge to the point where his first words were "no, you shut up!"<ul><li> The entire family is this in respect to Malcolm as their relationship is incredibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">hypocritical</a>. For example they have no problem excluding Malcolm from family activities yet Reese actually got into a fight with Steve because he felt that he was prioritizing him over his family. It is perfectly all right for Reese to steel Malcolm's girlfriend but when Malcolm does it to Reese he is constantly reminded of what a horrible person he is and he pretty much killed his brother.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBornReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasBornReady">I Was Born Ready</a>: The group attends Hal's family reunion and Hal's family is mean to Lois the whole time.

To elaborate: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As soon as Malcolm finishes high school, he is offered a six figure job working for a computer company. However, Hal and Lois refuse to let him take it, saying they have other plans for him. When he calls them out later on this, they reveal that they intend for him to work as a janitor while going through law school, to work his way up to become district attorney, win a place on the Senate, and then become President of the United States, while at the same time knowing that despite all of this, he will never be respected for any of it. While they're doing it because they believe Malcolm will be able to use his experience of being poor to help those like them when he becomes president, it says something about his family that they find manipulating Malcolm for decades and screwing him over every chance they get to be <em>easier</em>, than displaying any sort of personal fiscal responsibility.</span></li></ul></li><li> When in a position of power, Craig can be a gigantic dick. See his actions in "Watching The Baby", where he's forced people who couldn't afford purchases into slave labor.</li><li> Francis was also quite a bit of a Jerkass early on. As a young child he took a street cleaner for a joyride and even once tried to light a teddy bear on fire with matches. In one episode he buys an extra ticket to a wrestling show and pits Malcolm and Reese against each other to try and earn it, but ultimately winds up taking a girl he'd just met instead.</li><li> Heck, Reese (who actually becomes less of a jerk in time), Malcolm (who becomes almost as much of a jerk as Reese) and Dewey too.

Mr. Herkabe, on the other hand, is an unrepentant asshole who likes nothing better than making his students miserable. Special example goes to his role in <em>Malcolm films Reese,</em> where he tricks and manipulates Malcolm into getting Reese to trust him enough to make himself vulnerable, leading Reese to confide on camera that he hopes he and Malcolm can be best friends forever.

While they tended to be perfectly fine stories in their own right, it made the entire show feel like it was about two unconnected groups of people (the main family and Francis with whatever group he was involved with that season) rather than one unified whole. The series tested the waters with this in the fifth season by having Francis only appear in the plot-irrelevant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpen">Cold Open</a> sequences toward the end of the season.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">Revenge</a>: In <em>Malcolm vs. Reese</em>, when Francis decides to take a girl to the wrestling match over his own two siblings who so badly wanted to go with him and needless to say, neither Malcolm nor Reese are pleased with that <em>at all</em> given that they've spent all of the episode busting their asses for Francis to win the chance to go with him. How do they take vengeance on him for this? It starts by having Francis reading a note warning him that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">he will pay for what he did</a> while driving him and his date to the event. Francis blows it off, and then a cop pulls Francis over because the car had been reported stolen. When asked for ID and registration, Francis cannot provide because it was replaced with another Post-It note saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">it gets worse</a>. Banging is then heard from Francis's trunk, and the cop finds Malcolm and Reese hog-tied and gagged in there.

The rule on that show is that whatever makes the characters (especially Malcolm) the most miserable is what will happen. Just two examples: the episode that ends with Francis dragged naked behind a Zamboni on a skating rink (after trying to stop getting deeper in debt to his evil employer), and the episode that ends with Malcolm being insulted, a lot, by a girl, having a crying jag and drying his tears with poison oak.</li><li> There was an in-universe example of this as well... In one episode, Francis babysits his brothers and sets up a "contest" to see which brother loves him most by doing random tasks for him. This quickly devolves into a brawl, and Francis briefly cuts in, saying something to the effect of "Whoa, whoa. This was supposed to be about love, and you've turned it into something ugly! ...Carry on." He then sits down with a drink and watches his brothers fighting, saying "This, too, pleases me."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistTeacher">Sadist Teacher</a>: Herkabe.

It culminated with him torturing Reese to the point of catatonic depression, saying he'd let up only if Malcolm let his grades slip so that Herkabe could keep the honor of having the school's highest GPA.<ul><li> Also Commandant Spangler, where it is heavily implied, and confirmed in his final appearance, that the reason he is so strict with his unit is because bullying those weaker than himself is the only real joy that he could ever hope for. Francis allows him to keep this joy by placing him as a nurse in a retirement home where he can terrorize the old folks all he wants.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat">The Scapegoat</a>: The whole neighbourhood hates Malcolm's family, but only because if they didn't have someone to communally hate they'd turn on each other.
