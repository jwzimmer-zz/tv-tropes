When it began, it was notable for the fact that the entire show took place in the bar, never venturing outside, but this was dropped after a while.</p><p>The bar was owned for much of the series' run by Sam Malone (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TedDanson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TedDanson">Ted Danson</a>), a former relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox whose career was cut short by alcoholism.

During the first five seasons, the Sam-Diane romance was the central theme. Their relationship was the most over-elaborate in television history, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Ross and Rachel</a> came into the picture. After an acrimonious breakup at the end of Season 2, Sam had a relapse of his alcoholism while Diane voluntarily committed herself and fell in love with her psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KelseyGrammer">Kelsey Grammer</a>), who returned with her to Boston to help Sam kick the bottle. However, Diane's feelings for Sam had not gone away, and between Seasons 3 and 4, she left Frasier at the altar and, after trying to find herself through first hedonism, then asceticism, returned to her old job at Cheers. After Nicholas Colasanto died of a heart attack in 1985, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCharacterDiedWithHim">Coach was likewise written out as having died between seasons</a>, and in Season 4, he was replaced by his friendly but naive young penpal, Woody Boyd (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyHarrelson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WoodyHarrelson">Woody Harrelson</a>) of Hanover, Indiana. Meanwhile, just as Diane had moved on from her broken engagement to Frasier by re-kindling her romance with Sam, so Frasier found an unlikely new love in fellow psychiatrist Dr. Lilith Sternin (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BebeNeuwirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BebeNeuwirth">Bebe Neuwirth</a>) in Season 5; they married in Season 6 and became parents to a son, Frederick, in Season 8.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>After Season 5, Long left for a less-than-brilliant career in movies, and to raise her child, so the five years of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> culminated in Diane calling off her wedding to Sam to pursue her writing career at the urging of both her ex-fianc&eacute; and Sam himself. In Season 6, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstieAlley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirstieAlley">Kirstie Alley</a> joined the cast as Rebecca Howe, an ambitious but neurotic executive at the corporation to which Sam sold Cheers after Diane left; although Sam was given his job back as a bartender, ownership of Cheers was traded between Sam and Rebecca several times. Though the sexual tension between Sam and Rebecca remained a plot element, the show became more of an ensemble for its last six seasons.</p><p>For its first couple seasons, <em>Cheers</em> was teetering on the brink of cancellation despite acclaim from critics and actually came in dead last in the ratings its first year. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkToTheRescue">However, it slowly became one of the most popular shows on television.</a> Its final episode, which aired on May 20, 1993, was one of the most watched finales for a sitcom in American television history.</p><p>The first draft of the <em>Cheers</em> script was originally set in a hotel of all places, with wacky guests coming and going (the creators were inspired by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FawltyTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FawltyTowers">Fawlty Towers</a></em>). After the vast majority of script ideas ended up set in the hotel's bar, the producers just dropped the hotel concept entirely.</p><p>Cheers was modeled after the real-life Boston bar <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers_Beacon_Hill">the Bull &amp; Finch Pub<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, which was used as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingShot">exterior</a>. The two bars do not share a layout indoors, the Bull &amp; Finch&mdash;renamed Cheers Beacon Hill in 2002&mdash;being completely different, so a replica of Cheers as it appeared on the show was built at Faneuil Hall. The replica bar closed in August, 2020. Most considered the replica a cheap tourist trap (the Bull &amp; Finch/Cheers Beacon Hill less so, and it has some damned good baked beans).</p><p>The show produced two spin-offs: <em>The Tortellis</em>, a mainly forgotten one-season show featuring Carla's ex-husband Nick and his family, and the very successful <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> which ran for 11 years.</p><hr><h2> "Sometimes you wanna go, where everybody knows your trope":</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveFiveFive">555</a>: Carla's phone number is 555-7843.

What is unusual is how the character is used afterwards. Frasier proved so popular that he stuck around for two more seasons after the Diane-Frasier romance ended, then six more seasons after Diane left Cheers, then for eleven <em>more</em> years on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">his own show</a>. Not many Romantic False Leads have been on prime time television for 20 years.<ul><li> Ironically, however, Shelley Long actually despised the Frasier character for simply <em>being</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticFalseLead">Romantic False Lead</a>, and frequently lobbied hard to get Kelsey Grammer removed from the show.

It's not played entirely straight, though; Frasier is left bitter and angry and takes a very long time to get over it. In fact, he never gets over it during <em>Cheers</em> itself; it takes a couple of seasons of his own show on the other side of the country, and giving the visiting Diane an epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> to expunge the last of the venom.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: All the time, both series wide and episodic.

In Season 10's "I'm OK, You're Defective" the audience is presented with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward">Flash Forward</a> in which Lilith, Frasier's widow, is there for the reading of his will.

However, it's possible that Frasier and Lilith may have gotten remarried sometime in the future, with both displaying a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">lingering attraction</a> towards the other throughout the latter series.</li><li> Other series continuity errors with <em>Frasier</em>, mainly Frasier referring to his father as 1) an eminent psychiatrist and 2) dead, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">explained away</a> on <em>Frasier</em> as Frasier basically lying because he was not on good terms with his father at that time.</li><li> Also, the way various characters in <em>Frasier</em> describe Hester Crane, the mother of Frasier and Niles, makes her sound quite different and much more sympathetic than the character seen in an episode of <em>Cheers</em>. Seeing as Hester died somewhere between her one <em>Cheers</em> appearance and the beginning of <em>Frasier</em>, it's possible that everyone wants to remember only the good things about her, but this discrepancy is never addressed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The idea is supported when in <em>Frasier</em> Martin reveals that Hester once had an affair that he tries to keep secret so his sons can keep their saintly picture of her.</span><ul><li> A notable exception: during one of Shelley Long's guest appearances on <em>Frasier</em> ("Don Juan in Hell") her character Diane mentions that Frasier's mother once threatened her with a gun.</li></ul></li><li> The final teaser for Season 3 featured a scene with Coach (after Nicholas Colasanto had passed away) and Carla. Astute viewers would have instantly noticed that the scene was shot a long time before the airing because Carla (and Rhea Perlman herself) is not pregnant. The writers and producers knew this, however&mdash;it was used as a tribute to Colasanto since Coach was talking about a man who could see much farther than anyone realized.</li><li> In the second episode of the series, "Sam's Women," someone comes in looking for "Gus," a previous owner, and Coach tells him that Gus is dead. In Season 11's "The Last Picture Show," Gus O'Malley, who sold Cheers to Sam 17 years prior, comes back to the bar.</li><li> In Season Two's "Little Sister Don't Cha," Diane claims she was born late. In Season Four's "I'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday," she says she was prematurely born at eight months.<ul><li> In that episode, Cliff is regularly having sex with Carla's sister. Somewhere in the middle of the series, he becomes a virgin.</li></ul></li><li> A certain Valentine's Day episode late in the Rebecca years focuses on Sam's once-a-year relationship with a woman. Aside from the fact that the episode ends with the two of them being quite keen on the idea of extending their relationship <em>beyond</em> once a year (we never hear about her again)... Norm states early on that Sam and the woman have had this Valentine's tradition for nearly 20 years. The problem, of course, is how on Earth that's supposed to fit with the Diane years&mdash;especially during Seasons 2 and 5, when the two are <em>together</em> during that time. Diane of all people would not have settled for anything less than Sam spending Valentine's with <em>her</em>, and no other woman, during their relationship. (It's even worse when you recall that in "A Ditch In Time" Diane's lines in the final sequence establish&mdash;in no uncertain terms&mdash;that Sam <em>was</em> around for Valentine's during Season 2.) Plus, 20 years would have included Sam Malone's 1970s baseball career, and Red Sox pitchers would have been in Spring Training by February 14.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>: In season seven's "How to Win Friends and Electrocute People", Norm and another patron get into an argument about whether <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMunsters">The Munsters</a></em> is better, which nearly ends in fisticuffs before Rebecca intervenes.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a>: Aside from the obvious examples of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> and <em>The Tortellis</em>, both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Wings">Wings</a></em> and <em>St. Elsewhere</em> featured a <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverEpisode">Crossover Episode</a> with the show.

She's tempted to stay for good, until she's introduced to a new recruit - a blonde Boston University student called Ellen, who is ludicrously pretentious and insists she's a "poetess".
