Expecting absolute moral purity isn't just unrealistic, it's unhealthy and unfair to everyone.</li><li> As we see with Tahani and her parents, and to a lesser extent Eleanor and her old friends, you shouldn't let other people's negativity and apathy drag you down. That will only stand in the way of you becoming the best person you can be.</li><li> <em>Real</em> friends encourage you to be better and give you support when you need it. This is illustrated through Eleanor's relationship with her old friends vs. her relationship with Team Cockroach. (And Michael's relationship with Shawn vs. his relationship with the humans.)</li><li> In Season 3, Jason actually manages to get a very valid and relevant lesson across to the Judge: don't be so quick judge other people, because you don't know what they might be going through. Jason makes his point by telling a story about a member of his dance crew who was always late to rehearsal... because he was working three jobs to care for his grandparents. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After spending some time on Earth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbassHasAPoint">the Judge realizes he's completely right</a>.</span></li><li> People can change.

Eleanor was unbelievably rude and selfish as well as conning sick, elderly people out of their money. Chidi, while a decent fellow, made everyone around him miserable with his indecisiveness. And Tahani did good things, but not for altruistic reasons &mdash; it was her way of proving to her parents she was just as good, if not better, than her sister.</span> It's implied that the demons don't really care about a person's actions at all, they just take pleasure in torturing whoever the system sends their way, and it seems to fuel commentary about the harshness of the way humans have judged actions throughout history.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a>: The first episode mentions that <em>Florence Nightingale</em>, who is usually considered an example of this trope, ended up going to The Bad Place, which serves as the first clue that something is <em>seriously</em> wrong with the way the afterlife works.

Even Eleanor calls it the world's worst restaurant. However, the restaurant is in Australia, and the setpiece serves as a joke on how other countries perceive the U.S.</li><li> Eleanor also expresses this sentiment in "Jeremy Bearimy", describing America as the result of a society of selfish people.<div class="indent"><strong>Eleanor:</strong> Yeah, in America, everyone does whatever they want.

In the season finale, we discover that the chaos was planned by Michael, but there <em>was</em> an actual spanner &mdash; Chidi's lessons being more effective than the Bad Place thought they would be, causing Eleanor to confess her identity as the "mistake."

This put him on the path of discovering that no human has made it to the Good Place since 1497 due to a bunch of problems inherent to the afterlife's point system. Shawn knew of this the whole time and gleefully enabled it because it gave the Bad Place a near infinite supply of fresh new humans to torture, and when the Judge is made aware of the problem and proposes an experimental solution, he wastes no time trying to find any way that he can to make sure it fails because he absolutely will not let anything threaten the status quo he's maintained for over 500 years.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip">Stiff Upper Lip</a>: Tahani mentions a British "saying" about not letting anyone know when you're sad.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpottingTheThread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpottingTheThread">Spotting the Thread</a>:<ul><li> In "Someone Like Me as a Member..."
