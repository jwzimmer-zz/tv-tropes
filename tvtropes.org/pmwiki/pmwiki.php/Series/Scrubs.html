Dorian trains and works at Sacred Heart Hospital, learning the difference between studying medicine and being a doctor, as well as how being a person can differ from both. His guide through much of this is Dr. Perry Cox, an acerbic, sharp-tongued and profoundly bitter attending physician with a terrible personal, professional, romantic and social life but a genuine desire to help his patients.</p><p>Other people in the hospital provide contrast, support, and the more-than-occasional weird situation: J.D.'s long-time friend Dr. Chris Turk, a surgeon who tries to be the best and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulBrotha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulBrotha">blackest</a> thing since burnt sliced toast; nurse Carla Espinosa, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a> to the staff with a penchant for delivering advice whether you like it or not; Dr. Elliot Reid, J.D's (female) on-again, off-again love interest and possibly the only doctor on staff more nerdy and psychologically messed-up than he is; Dr. Robert "Bob" Kelso, the hospital's Chief of Medicine and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> of a boss whose job requires him to be a heartless bastard and think only of the hospital in fiscal terms; and "Janitor", a mysterious and often menacing presence in J.D.'s life who has taken the role of his nemesis.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The show uses rapid-fire dialogue, a running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnerMonologue">mental commentary</a> in J.D.'s head for narration, rapid scene changes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">hippocratical</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">humor</a> and a single-camera viewpoint to maintain a high energy to the story and to the comedy. The show also takes quite a few dives into the surreal end of the pool, especially in its frequent depiction of J.D's fantasies. These fantasies provide much of the show's humor, as it deals with the often bizarre train-of-thought and overly literal depictions of metaphors people use.</p><p>Scrubs became well known for its focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">extensive supporting cast</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringCharacter">recurring characters</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">largely accurate medicine and politics surrounding it</a> and paying attention to the gradual progression of the careers of the young doctors (how they go from interns to residents to attending physicians and eventually department heads).</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><em>Scrubs</em> spent its first seven seasons on NBC, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChannelHop">moved to ABC</a> for its eighth campaign. That season ended with what was thought to be the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, an episode whose end credits were played alongside footage of the cast and crew tearfully saying goodbye to each other. But in a surprise move, ABC picked up <em>Scrubs</em> for yet another season; this resulted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a> set at New Sacred Heart, a teaching hospital. Though Turk, Dr. Cox, Dr. Kelso and J.D. all showed up (the latter for only 6 episodes), the focus was on a new group of interns, with intern Lucy Bennett largely replacing J.D. as narrator. The show officially ended after the Season 9 finale.</p><p>There is now a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ShoutOut/Scrubs">Shout Out</a> page.

This is why Dr. Cox's sister, who appears in a later season, converted to a strong Christian faith, whereas it is one of the reasons that Dr. Cox himself is strongly against the concept of God.</li><li> Jordan in one episode uses this trope as an excuse for why she's so mean, though she admits later on that it's a lie and that her parents were supportive.</li><li> Elliott's parents were at the very least emotionally abusive, and neither of them sees her as being good enough for various reasons, explaining her neuroses. Her mother's promiscuity, constantly cheating on her husband and sleeping with most of Elliot's ex-boyfriends definitely didn't help either.</li><li> The Janitor claims this at times, but has revealed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleChoicePast">many self-contradictory stories about his childhood and is an admitted liar</a>. Some flashbacks bear out at least a few of his statements, predominantly explaining why he acts how he currently does. These include the Janitor becoming what he is because his mother intentionally threw out his teddy bear to teach him a lesson about keeping his room clean and the revelation that he takes pride in the fact that he keeps the floors of the hospital clean enough to eat off of; when asked why, there is a flashback that shows him as a child with a meal set out in front of him on the floor. His mom (off-camera) tells him that if he is going to throw his food on the floor, that is where he is going to eat from now on.</li><li> In the episode My Transition, Janitor gives Carla a dog kennel he calls a "baby cage" and explains how his mother used it on him. When everyone reacts with shock and disgust, Janitor quickly claims it was a joke, then walks away with an angry face. Later he's on the phone to his mother and says "No, Mom, playpen/baby cage is not like tomato/tomato."</li><li> When Carla calls Katie out for taking the credit for a medical procedure that she didn't do, Katie tries to use the fact that her dad died when she was six, causing her mother to turn to alcohol in order to cope, to defend her selfishness. Carla doesn't care.<div class="indent"><strong>Carla</strong>: Heard it! Me, dead mom. J.D., dead dad. Elliot, emotionally abusive parents. Dr.Cox, emotionally and physically abusive dead parents, which he may have killed. No one's sure. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0dj6p');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0dj6p" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0dj6p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though it's worth noting that both Carla and JD were adults when they lost a parent, which just can't be compared to a six year old losing her dad. Of course, J.D.'s parents divorced when he was seven, his father was a travelling salesman who was almost always going through financial difficulties (to the point that he couldn't afford to buy J.D. a bike, so he'd buy a single piece every year as a birthday present for J.D.), his mother married "everyone that rang the doorbell", and she may have been an alcoholic for a while, though she is shown as having loved J.D. a lot.</span></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACappella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ACappella">A Cappella</a>:<ul><li> The Blanks is an A cappella group fronted by Sam Lloyd who plays Ted Buckland. The band has made many appearances on <em>Scrubs</em>, introducing themselves as The Worthless Peons.</li><li> The Janitor is forced to make up an a capella band on the spot when he's trying to come up with an excuse for why he wore a suit to get coffee with Elliot; he mistakenly thought it was a date but is far too embarrassed to admit it. Unfortunately Ted and the rest of the Worthless Peons overhear the Janitor bragging about how Hibbleton is the best band in town, and promptly challenge him to prove it in a competition, with Elliot as the judge. Janitor is able to coax Troy and Randall into joining him and they somehow <em>win</em> with an amazing improvisation of &#147;Barbara Anne&#148;.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesInHisTent">Achilles in His Tent</a>: Dr. Cox after three of his patients die.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>:<ul><li> Dr. Kelso angrily denounces the vandalism on the hospital's sign, but privately admits to Turk that he thinks "Sacred Fart" is hilarious.</li><li> Played with when Carla laughs to herself after Turk breaks wind; Elliot gleefully asks her if she thinks farts are funny too, despite Carla having scolded Turk for it earlier. Turns out Carla was laughing at something else.</li><li> Occurs when Carla talks about all the women Dr. Cox has slept with.</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Carla:</strong> Your ex-wife, the nurse in radiology, your ex-wife, the medical intern, your ex-wife...</div><div class="indent"><strong>Dr. Cox:</strong> Will you get off my ex-wife?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Carla:</strong> I will if you will.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Dr. Cox:</strong> <em>[thinks for a moment, then starts laughing]</em> See, now I'm so proud of you I can't even be mad at you.</div><ul><li> After hearing a rather long-winded spiel about the Janitor's current life goals, Jordan notes that the next time she hears someone say something boring to her, she's just going to leave. Kelso begins to interject with his own opinion and Jordan immediately leaves.<div class="indent"><strong>Kelso</strong>: Ha! Well played!</div></li><li> From the same episode as the above scenario:<div class="indent"><strong>Elliot</strong>: ...but you never said you liked <em>me</em>, not even as a joke.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Cox</strong>: I like you.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Elliot</strong>: Really?</div><div class="indent"><strong>Cox</strong>: No.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Elliot</strong>: Nicely done.</div><div class="indent"><strong>Cox</strong>: Thank you.</div></li><li> In "My Cookie Pants", Dr. Cox pretends to be on the phone as he's walking alongside Kelso to the hospital so they don't have to talk to each other. Kelso points out that Cox isn't even <em>using</em> a phone as a prop, instead holding his hand to his ear and talking into it. Cox's response is to simulate closing the phone in his hands and note that his friend on the phone called Kelso a tool, to which Kelso admits he can't think of anything to say in response, instead complimenting him.<ul><li> As they finish walking together, Cox begins chewing Kelso out for wasting his twilight years in a coffee shop doing nothing, only for Kelso to interrupt him by saying that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicEcho">he has to take a call</a> before making the same phone gesture that Cox did earlier and walking away.

In addition, she has a complicated UST thing going on with J.D. and even breaks up with a boyfriend because she can't handle a relationship at that time.

We're supposed to forget he's a Jerkass who <em>still</em> hasn't apologised for how he treated Murray. It's Murray who apologises in the end.</li><li> In an early episode when JD surpasses Carla in medical knowledge, she later decides to tell off Dr Cox for giving JD trouble instead of letting him handle his own problems. This of course leads Dr. Cox to heap even more abuse on JD. JD lashes out at her for giving him advice (in a rather condescending manner while calling him Bambi) during a procedure. He apologizes, but that is not enough for Carla as she later rants at him about not being respected enough and how JD looked down on her. So the lesson is to not look down on your subordinates. Yet Carla showed less respect by interfering in his business and telling him what to do.</li><li> In another episode after JD finds out about Kim's miscarriage and he is depressed. He learns from Carla, Elliot, and Turk to stop being a burden to them after he "has driven them crazy for six years". This coming from people who drag JD into 80% of their relationship problems (Carla and Turk) and has helped Elliot since day one.</li><li> <em>My Perspective</em> is supposed to be about J.D. learning how to not force his own problems on other people and he needs to work on them him and seeing things from their perspective. Fair enough, the problem is is that when you look back on the show, you realize that J.D.'s friends are the ones who actually force their problems on him, like Turk forcing him to get in the middle of his fight with Carla to try and get her to come home, despite J.D.'s protests. Not only that, but it comes across as hollow because J.D. is now homeless because he couldn't keep Elliot's apartment and he just broke up with his girlfriend who he believes has miscarried their child. And he's now gotten a condition where he passes out when he poops, which could have led to serious injury if he had hit his head on something.

Elliot becomes less neurotic, J.D. becomes more confident in himself (and more humble), Turk becomes less self-absorbed, although all of these traits still remain with them throughout the series. Dr. Cox learns that sometimes it is okay to play the system by asking for recommendations, which is why <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he eventually takes over as Chief of Medicine.</span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>:<ul><li> J.D.'s slide into effeminacy happens far too quickly for it to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a>, and seems more a byproduct of Braff and McGinley's portrayal's playing off one another even better than originally thought. In the very early parts of the show, J.D. was a fairly normal-seeming 25-year-old guy, apart from his inherent dorkiness and neuroses impeding his social life. But one of the first things that changes faster than any other characteristic (or other character) is how quickly the writers began playing up his more effeminate side, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensitiveGuyAndManlyMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensitiveGuyAndManlyMan">especially to clash against Cox's classic man's man personality</a>. He was also at least somewhat familiar with sports in the early seasons, and while he and Turk were obviously very close from the get-go, the "bromance" knob was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">turned to eleven</a> at a concurrent pace with just how much more effeminate J.D. became the first few seasons.</li><li> In the first season, Turk deeply resented being viewed as a token Black man or anything other than a good surgeon. In later episodes, he is the epitome of every Black stereotype in Sitcoms and worries about not being thought of as Black.</li><li> In an early episode the fact that Dr. Kelso pretends that his marriage is perfect is a major plot point (as he uses it as a way to avoid being asked for favors except for one day a year). In later seasons everyone seems to be aware that his marriage is in shambles and he and his wife are miserable.</li><li> Season 1 portrayed Elliot as more of a smug, competitive know-it-all. Her famous neurosis and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">Genki Girl</a> tendencies took a while to surface. Likewise, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> from Season 2 onward that she can't say dirty words (she uses "bajingo" as euphemism for "vagina") but in Season 1 she used the words penis and vagina normally.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic">Christianity Is Catholic</a>: Before the writers decided to drop Turk's role as a stereotypical Black charismatic Christian (which was handed off to Laverne), a Christmas episode has J.D. admiring his friend for his faith, featuring an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> with Turk portrayed as a Baptist preacher. Later in the episode, Turk forces Carla and J.D. to go to <em>Mass</em>. Protestants use service, church, or any number of other terms for their worship practices, but decidedly <em>not</em> Mass.<ul><li> A more subtle example: when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Laverne finally passes away after Carla is able to say goodbye to her</span>, the screen pans down to her hand which appears to be clutching a rosary.

JD and Elliot's students never appear or are mentioned again after the episode despite the episode going out of its way to establish conflicts between the interns and their students. Turk's student fairs a little better since she begins dating Dr. Cox in the same episode... only to dump him in the next and THEN never be mentioned again.</li><li> Bonnie Chang, Turk's rival surgeon and nemesis during Series 2.<ul><li> She is briefly mentioned in season 5 when Dr. Wen posts the surgical rankings, as one of the people who is better than Turk.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleanPrettyChildbirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleanPrettyChildbirth">Clean, Pretty Childbirth</a>: Lampshaded <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sbLHbxq3i0">here<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>, in which a doctor gives a fairly realistic description of what to expect during a birth.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show</a>: Season 6's "My Night to Remember", framed around the characters reminiscing while treating an amnesiac patient.

There was once a scene where he was on the phone with her because his dog Baxter had cornered her and was viciously snarling at her. He took the dog's side and laughed and hung up as she was being mauled on the other end.

As "Tasty Coma Wife" puts it, she had already grieved over losing her husband, his actual death really just gave her some closure. This trope is more definitely in effect several episodes earlier when JD and the wife went on a date while the husband was actually still alive (but of course comatose). They have a good time together but JD backs out before anything physical happens because this trope makes him uncomfortable with the situation.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommanderContrarian">Commander Contrarian</a>: After Dr. Kelso retires as Chief of Medicine and Dr. Cox takes the job, Kelso spells out to JD that Kelso kept Cox around, and kept promoting him, because he could rely on Cox to play this for him. If Dr. Cox asked Kelso for something, Kelso said "no" as was his wont, and Cox let it drop, Kelso knew it wasn't that important. But if Dr. Cox kept pestering him, then he knew it was something worth paying attention to.

Both indiscretions were made while Turk and Carla were well aware that what they were doing was either wrong or something that would upset the other. But whereas Turk's choices pushed Carla to move out and earned him quite a bit of scorn from other character's, Turk never even learned about the pre-wedding date Carla went on, let alone how strong her feelings were for him in the past.

The reality is that she's just an awful person, and is never called out on it.

Kelso because he has to live with the fact that he's responsible for a patient's death due to sacrificing his place in a drug trial and Cox because he couldn't do anything to save the patient.</li><li> "My Cabbage" and "My Five Stages". My Cabbage ends with J.D. firing his incompetent intern, who unwittingly infects a beloved patient with a fatal disease on his way out the door.

Later seasons it was stated outright that he had to be the bad guy as the Chief of Medicine, otherwise the hospital wouldn't function. But it came up early when he learned from J.D. that an older doctor who was introduced as Kelso's best friend and the nicest doctor at Sacred Heart (played by Dick Van Dyke) was unwilling to keep up with the constantly changing medical field. He had to force the guy to retire and was noticeably saddened to do so.</li><li> Dr. Cox plays a prank that spirals out of control and convinces everyone in the hospital that Kelso's dead, while not going so far as to suggest that Kelso actually has a heart of gold does imply that Kelso is partially acting like a jerk to the world and is more wounded by how people think of him than he lets on.<div class="indent"><strong>Cox:</strong> And there it is ... this 'I don't care what anyone thinks of me' act?

Todd's ability to not get fired was handwaved in one episode explaining he's too good of a doctor to let go.<ul><li> Elliot's father never got any comeuppance for cutting Elliot off and out of his life.

However, while Townsend is a legitimate doctor he has fallen way behind the times in terms of medical technique and has failed to become certified in or learn the new treatments that would be much more effective than the outdated ones he is still using. After using one of those outdated techniques almost causes a patient to die, Kelso and Townsend <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVTWoPeMWSQ">have a quiet confrontation<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> and Kelso is reluctantly forced to let Townsend go from the hospital as a result.<div class="indent"><strong>Kelso:</strong> Say, listen, um... nowadays it has become sort of hospital protocol to do modified Seldinger in a case like this.

Eventually, as they were running out of tests and trying to convince the guy he was obviously perfectly healthy, Dr. Cox sets him up with an extremely uncomfortable test for a one-in-a-million condition in the hopes that he'll go away. It unexpectedly turned out positive.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a>: Elliot very much qualifies with her behavior towards Dr. Cox in later seasons. In a few episodes, Elliot would rant at Dr Cox about how he has never helped her. Not counting that he helps her in all of these episodes and other times, he punched out the CHIEF OF MEDICINE for her, risking his job.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">The Unfair Sex</a>: <em>Scrubs</em> is really bad for this.<ul><li> Best exemplified in JD's Anvilicious closing narration in My Tormented Mentor: "There will always be a battle for power between the sexes, sometimes a man just has to give in, other times he just has to take a positive step, and once in a while a man just has to be there for her." The subtext being that women can't be wrong because they have it hard on account of being women(!?), while in the same episode the chief complaint a female surgeon has against Turk is that he assumes women in their profession have it hard (which is true, at least in universe) and then punishes him for being perfectly nice to her. The female surgeon who is in charge of Turk constantly insults everyone around her and then prevents him from operating indefinitely because she overheard him defending her in front of the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMolester">Memetic Molester</a> and he told her he doesn't share the prejudices of the other male surgeons. Hint: You're not supposed to be supportive of women, it's demeaning. All instances of female surgeons in the show basically illustrate one point: cocky men are assholes, cocky women are professionals who fight the good fight for women all over the world and it's completely justified if they lash out and misuse their authority form time to time (or all the time.)</li><li> That episode has another example with Dr. Cox and Jordan. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jordan's brother dies (who was also best friends with Perry)</span>, Dr. Cox is extremely upset but finds it difficult to move on with Jordan's friends staying with them. Said friends openly insult and demean Perry at every opportunity and even lash out at him when he tries to get close to Jordan for emotional support. In the end, rather than getting an aesop that the two of them need to work together to overcome the loss, Perry learns he's meant to comfort and support Jordan at all times, even letting her cheerily keep her friends at the apartment knowing how much they upset him. His emotional needs are all but ignored.</li><li> Carla demands to know when JD is moving out of the apartment because she wants to move in with Turk. It's a wonder why JD even goes along with this considering that it's <em>his</em> apartment! Even <em>Turk</em> briefly moved out in the Pilot, so you could argue this only reinforces that it belongs to him.</li><li> Carla in one episode repeatedly infantilizes JD, her workplace superior, both by mocking his competence and referring to him as "Bambi" in front of his patients. It gets to the point where JD (who admittedly is having a bad day) snaps and furiously reminds Carla of her place. Both of them in this situation are out of line: Carla was demeaning JD in front of a patient, which can seriously impact the patient's confidence in their care, while JD's pulling rank humiliates a medical professional who is far more skilled and experienced than he is and who only has to take orders from him due to the medical hierarchy. However, JD is promptly reamed out by everyone he knows for the dispute and is clearly portrayed as the only one in the wrong. To save their friendship he apologizes, and to add insult to injury, "Bambi" forever after becomes Carla's nickname for him.</li><li> Elliot sleeps with JD then immediately dumps him the day after because her old boyfriend came back; JD's jealousy is depicted as petty and he's advised to "be a good friend" (i.e., <em>not</em> tell Elliott's boyfriend that she cheated on him while he was away, with JD no less, even when said boyfriend asks JD point-blank if anything happened between them while he was gone). Later, JD convinces Elliot to leave her boyfriend but realises that he doesn't love her. After struggling over his dilemma, he admits this to her; she physically assaults him and at the start of the new season, injects him with something that knocks him out and holds a grudge all season.</li><li> Elliot is engaged to marry Keith. The day before the wedding, she realises that she doesn't love him (wow, small world) and dumps him. The day afterwards, she changes her mind and gets back together with him, sleeping with him twice. Then she decides that she's repeating a bad pattern and dumps him <em>again</em>. Keith is understandably furious and carries a grudge for the next season; meanwhile, Elliot can't understand what the big deal is and bemoans Keith's "lack of professionalism". (Speaking of professionalism, the reason they got together in the first place was because Elliot wanted a sex buddy and chose Keith, her subordinate.) Carla does manage to force Elliot to face up to the psychological devastation inflicted on Keith and apologize, but this is undercut substantially by being basically a way to write Keith off the show. He wasn't seen until the penultimate scene of season eight's last show (which was intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">the series finale</a> ) and never again.</li><li> JD accidentally gets Kim pregnant on their first date, but they decide to raise the baby and work together to make their relationship work. Kim suddenly takes a lucrative job offer a few states over (naturally, JD doesn't want her to go but "learns" that the correct reaction is to support her decision unconditionally) and a few months later, informs JD that she has miscarried. Turns out, that was a lie to get out of their relationship. JD is furious but decides that he will get back together with Kim for the sake of his child, even if it means trapping himself in a loveless relationship for the rest of his life. When Kim is in labour she demands to know what he thinks of her; he admits that he doesn't love her and she is furious, dumping him immediately afterwards.</li><li> Inverted in one episode where Elliot makes out with the father of a child patient only to discover that he's married. When he tells his wife, the wife goes into a frenzy directed only at Elliot, and hunts her for the rest of the episode.</li><li> Elliot demands that JD tell her he loves her in "the perfect way" and acts completely furious when he calls her on this, that they both agreed that the drama was <em>over</em> and it was this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">growth in character</a> was the reason <em>they got back together</em>. Naturally, he has to eventually buckle in and give into her unreasonable demands.</li><li> Elliot (once again) not understanding why JD is initially upset that she set up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CleaningUpRomanticLooseEnds">Sean and Kim</a> together, believing that since they (JD and Elliot) weren't dating at the time, it shouldn't have been a problem? By thinking of how this relates to her, she's completely failed to recognise that because JD and Sean mutually loathe each other, setting Sean up with the <em>mother of JD's child</em> is something JD might have a problem with. Furthermore, depending on how that relationship works out, Sean would now be in the position where he might become the new step-father to JD's son, which he's already acting in a father-figure capacity for now! When JD even brings this up, she tells him to just get over it and be happy for them.</li><li> This is also downplayed and given a form of metalampshading in "my butterfly". Carla gets a chewing out by Kelso, and both scenarios play out differently. When Turk stands up for her she berates him for not letting her "defend herself", but in the other one he says nothing and she chews him out for not sticking up for her, making it clear she was angry at being humiliated by Kelso and took it out on Turk.</li><li> The case of an epilleptic girl from the episode "My Big Move". The girl refused to take her medications, for which Dr. Cox chews her out for endangering her own life and telling her to grow up. It turn out the girl refused to take her medications because "she was tired of people telling her what to do", even though it was her parents telling her to follow the dosage instructions. In the end Elliot tells the girl that she will be given the instructions directly. And it's seen to be a good thing, despite the fact that the girl had refused to take her medication for the aforementioned "reason". And to top it off Elliot tells Dr. Cox to mind the insecurities of all women, basically the aesop of the episode being: Treat all women, even grown-ups as hissy-fitting teenagers, play along their insecurities instead of calling them out for acting childish. (Which as previously mentioned Carla does to JD and Turk in almost every time they are being childish.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName">Unfortunate Name</a>: Very many, but one of the funniest being a memorable patient who's a Private in the army named Private Dancer.<ul><li> At the end of season 8, J.D. decides to work at the same hospital as Kim, stating he got on well with her boss, Dr. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumour">Mantoots</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnintelligible">The Unintelligible</a>: Happens when Dr. Cox's son, Jack, begins to talk.
