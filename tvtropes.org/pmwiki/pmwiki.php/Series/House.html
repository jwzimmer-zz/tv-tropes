Created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidShore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidShore">David Shore</a>, it centres around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughLaurie">Dr. Gregory House</a>, a genius diagnostician and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> at Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital.</p><p>House suffers from chronic pain in his right leg. He copes with it by using a cane and taking a lot of Vicodin pills. House is only interested in unusual medical cases and while he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrJerk">abrasive socially, professionally, and personally</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">he is so good at diagnosing patients</a> that the Dean of Medicine, Dr. Lisa Cuddy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastDJ">allows him to continue</a>. His best (and, really, only true) friend is Dr. James Wilson, head of the Oncology (Cancer) department.

A patient suffers unexplained, potentially deadly symptoms which worsen dramatically. House begins the case by having a brainstorming session with his crack team of doctors: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OmarEpps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OmarEpps">Eric Foreman</a>, Allison Cameron and Robert Chase. They come up with possible causes while House makes snide remarks and mocks their suggestions. They diagnose the disease incorrectly for the majority of the episode, subjecting the patient to a wide variety of tests that may or may not be ethically sound. Finally, the real problem is found via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>. The solutions are not always from House himself, and they range from the mundane to exceptionally rare, and the end result for the patient can be anywhere between an easy full recovery to a death sentence. The character development &amp; personal interactions of House, his team, Wilson &amp; Cuddy is the other major element of the show.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>While House is ostensibly a physiologist rather than a psychoanalyst his diagnoses benefit from him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist">verbally pummeling his patient and their relatives or associates</a> into revealing all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">secrets</a> they possess, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">abuse</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBySex">sexual misbehavior</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">drug addiction</a>, etc., one of which will prove instrumental in diagnosing their illness after House has ruined their life. While he has genuine medical reasons for doing what he does, in the course of finding the solution to the puzzle, he is shameless manipulator, dismissive of medical &amp; legal ethics and it is always left to interpretation how big of a jerkass he is.</p><p><strong>Character tropes go on to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/House" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/House">Characters Sheet</a>.</strong></p><p>Dr. Gregory House is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtThatWas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtThatWas">not to be confused with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GregoryHorrorShow">the Gregory House</a>.</p><p></p><hr><h2><em>House</em> provides examples of the following tropes:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-B&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>:<ul><li> Foreman's brain damage after being sick.

Or rather, that's what the audience and the doctors believe at first. It turns out that it was just erotic asphyxiation. Safe or not is debatable, but at least it was consensual.</li><li> In another episode, a man tries to "rape" a woman before collapsing from an ailment, but everyone except the audience knows that it's just a game between a husband and wife. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Inverted at the end when it turns out that the wife wanted to murder her husband by poisoning him; the team never finds out why, though.</span></li><li> Another episode had an infant who was extremely underweight due to a medical condition. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HippieParents">Hippie Parents</a>, who fed the baby a vegan diet, were thought to be at fault and Child Protective Services was contacted before they revealed that they consulted an actual nutritionist and House correctly diagnosed the child.</li><li> Another episode had a father come into the hospital with his two children. The son was highly aggressive and the daughter had her first period at <em>6</em>, leading them to believe there was abuse (imitation from the son and molestation for the daughter). It turns out those are also symptoms of testosterone exposure, which resulted from the supplements their father was taking.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a>:<ul><li> House's dad.</li><li> Chase's parents.

At one point he's also seen replacing his Vicodin addiction with obsessive cooking. He turns out to be really good at it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoringThePests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdoringThePests">Adoring the Pests</a>: House once kept a rat he'd found in Stacy's house (it gave him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> necessary to the case), calling it Steve McQueen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: The show ranges the entire range of this trope from sick and dying parents worried about leaving their kids behind to parents terrified because their child is dying and no one knows why.<ul><li> The worst has to be Season 7 episode "Selfish," where parents have to decide whether or not they want to sacrifice half the life of their chronically ill son to save their normally healthy daughter.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlasPoorScrappy">Alas, Poor Scrappy</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amber</span> in the season 4 finale, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">House</span> in the series finale.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedBoss">The Alleged Boss</a>: Type 3.

In addition, these tendencies serve to destroy most of Wilson's romantic relationships because he refuses to burden his partner with his own needs. Part of the reason his relationship with Amber goes so well is that she calls him out on this and forces him to put himself first once in a while.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheScript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheScript">All There in the Script</a>: The man who shot House at the end of Season 2 is not named in the episode, but the credits identify him as Jack <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Moriarty</a>. He is also identified as such by the subtitles on the Season 2 DVD collection.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeForeignThemeSong">Alternative Foreign Theme Song</a>: The show has two foreign themes: European and Singaporean, although all three can be heard can be heard at various times on TV syndication and on Netflix within the United States, seemingly at random.

Even in long-term users, Vicodin withdrawal is usually characterized by symptoms no worse than lack of appetite, mild nausea, irritability, anxiety, and restlessness. The withdrawal symptoms House usually displays (vomiting, insomnia, sweats and chills, depression, mood swings) are what would typically characterize frequent diacetylmorphine (heroin) abuse. Vicodin is also not known to cause <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">dissociative disorder (conditions that involve disruptions or breakdowns of memory, awareness, identity and/or perception)</span>. That being said, the plotline of season 3 suggests that House is taking a fair amount more than a typical patient.<ul><li> Additionally House is in a great deal of pain, and anyone who has ever had a crippling nerve injury can attest that a high level of pain can cause the symptoms he does experience. In fact, in patients with nerve conditions such as fibromyalgia a condition known as fibrofog can frequently occur. This generally consists of a sort of fog-like state where the person's higher functions slow. It's not much of a reach to equate that to what House experienced.</li></ul></li><li> Methadone is a long-acting synthetic opioid agonist that, like any opiate, causes euphoria. It is prescribed to treat pain in opioid-dependent patients as well as addiction in heavy users of high-potency opiates. Because methadone is many, many times more powerful than hydrocodone (it's listed as a greater than 2 to 1 conversion compared to baseline (morphine), whereas hydrocodone has no consensus but is known to be less than 0.33 to 1), methadone is never used to treat even the heaviest Vicodin abuse. That would be like prescribing 99 Bananas to someone addicted to wine... no matter how much wine they drink, taking shots of vodka just isn't going to improve the situation. There are also other opioids which are more effective at managing pain, so if they specifically wanted to curb House's Vicodin use (likely, due to the risk acetaminophen poses to the liver) they would step up to oxycontin (0.33 to 1) or ms-contin (1 to 1).</li><li> Methadone is used to prevent heroin abuse, mainly because there are a limited number of opioid receptors in the brain and methadone fills them up (preventing heroin's effects from being felt), and because it delays the onset of withdrawal symptoms for many hours, thus reducing both the cravings and incentives for abuse in patients who take it correctly. Methadone users continue to experience physical dependence, but after the addiction is under control, the dose can be lowered to reduce dependence.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AskAStupidQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AskAStupidQuestion">Ask a Stupid Question...</a>: House is more than willing to point this out to people.<div class="indent"><strong>Cuddy:</strong> Chase and Cameron are together? <br><strong>House:</strong> If by "together" you mean "having sex in the janitor's closet" then yeah! <br><strong>Cuddy:</strong> The janitor's closet <em>here?</em> <br><strong>House:</strong> No, the one at the local high school.

In the early seasons when the writers seemed to feel the series needed a "villain", Chase betrayed House with one of them (Vogler) and is set up to look as if he did with another (Tritter). Some of Chase's Butt Monkeydom is a direct result of House's resentment over that.

Also, it's theorized that Watson had three wives (the stories are unclear and Doyle is somewhat vague on this point), mirroring Wilson's three divorces.

He knew what was wrong with the patient, and this action was solely about saving her life.</li><li> One example of this is an episode where he was able to diagnose a 66-year-old patient before the halfway point, but the patient needed a new heart. His age and risk factor meant there was no chance of getting one through the normal red-tape, so House made a plan to acquire the heart from an overweight lady brain-dead from a car crash whose organs would have been rejected for general use anyway. It ended up a little more complicated than that and House said some very mean and cruel things to the grieving husband ("We're talking about meat") but his goals were to save someone who <em>could</em> be saved because of her.</li><li> In the S4 finale House <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">risks his life by undergoing deep-brain stimulation at Wilson't request.

House gets all the strange cases because that's what he specializes in, and other doctors will send their patients to him (and some patients will swim across an ocean, literally). However, this still doesn't account for the rarity of most of the diseases on the show. His awful bedside manner could also play into this.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMainCharactersDoEverything">The Main Characters Do Everything</a>:<ul><li> Once in a while, we see a surgeon or radiologist in the background doing their jobs. Most of the time, it's one of the main characters. It's possibly due to Cuddy's lack of any actual control over them, but you'd think the technicians and surgeons would be upset that these guys from Diagnostics are doing their jobs. Also, the main characters tend to do a lot of nurse-work, as on most medical drama shows.</li><li> Interestingly, in the two episodes from Season 6 where the POV is switched from House ("Wilson" and "5 to 9"), the nurses (or at least the ones serving as personal assistants to Wilson and Cuddy, respectively) have a bigger role, so it seems that this trope applies more to House's team than to the hospital as a whole. The trope is played however painfully straight with Chase, who, despite being an intensive care specialist, once he got magically transformed into a surgeon is able to handle any surgery under the sun.</li><li> Possibly justified. The few times we do see House working with the rest of the hospital staff, he invariably manages to really piss them off, with several threatening to report him for unethical conduct. And in one case, he actually blackmails a doctor into committing a breach of ethics for one of his patients. It's quite believable that no one outside his team will work on his cases if they can avoid it. Add in that House doesn't trust anyone. He assumes that previous doctors and nurses have screwed up tests and diagnoses. He wants everything done by his chosen few because he has a modicum of trust in them.</li><li> It's flat out stated by Cuddy in one episode that half of the hospital staff refuses to work with House.</li><li> It's explicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the Vogler arc that most individual doctors in other departments have a <em>far</em> heavier caseload than the entire Diagnostic Medicine department, so part of House's reasoning is that given that his team has so much "free time" they might as well do everything for a particular patient up to and including changing bedpans on the off chance that in the process they will notice some obscure detail that will give him an insight into a particularly puzzling case.</li><li> Occasionally the main characters head out to investigate a patient's home or workplace for potential causes for their ailments, up to and including wrangling animals that might have passed on an infection. This should not even fall under the purview of <em>anyone employed by the hospital</em>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalignedMixedMarriage">Maligned Mixed Marriage</a>: Seemingly played straight <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but ultimately subverted</span> in "Fools for Love".

After one instant of manipulation House calls him out, smiles, and respectfully calls him "you manipulative bitch".</li><li> Dr. Nolan, the head of the Mayfield Psychiatric Institute, has become the one character in the entire show who has somehow managed to stay one step ahead of House at all times. For example, knowing House would cheek his medications, he switched House to placebos. Knowing that House would cause a riot among the in-patients, he gave the in-patients what they wanted, but didn't give House what he wants. And knowing that House would sneak to the phones to try to get Wilson to break him out, he called Wilson first to tell him to not do anything House tells him to do.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a>: "House vs. God", with Boyd, the faith healer.<ul><li> Series 4 episode 4, though it sits mostly on the mundane side, excepting House's deceased Grandfather.</li><li> Episode 8.18, leaning slightly towards the magical side.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amber</span> in the Season 4 finale.<ul><li> Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">who House is a Shout Out to,</a> Jack Moriarty in the Season 2 finale probably also counts.<ul><li> Also given that, the name "House" is a play on the name "Holmes," and "Wilson" is a play on "Watson."</li></ul></li><li> Foreman's name could be related to his willingness to become a leader, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not to mention his actual role in Season Eight.</span></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumBlending" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumBlending">Medium Blending</a>: "Epic Fail", with 3D animations from the video game designed by the patient supplanting reality.</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyKill">Mercy Kill</a>:<ul><li> House mercy-killed a patient at least once.

Also, most people who knew House before the pain in his leg began there wasn't really any difference in his personality before then and he was still a world renowned doctor, thus there was no actual reason curing his leg pain should effect who he is or how well he works.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Stealth Pun</a>:A musical pun: in the episode "Half-Wit" House plays the opening part of a song with a musical savant on a piano.

These include:<ul><li> "Three Stories". This season one episode had House lecturing a room full of interns about three similarly themed cases. Each of the three patients had a problem with one of their legs, and may have had to amputate in order to avoid complications. The first one was a farmer, who had to get the amputation. The second one was a volleyball player, who was lucky enough to keep her leg. The third case was a shocker. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was House. He knew keeping his leg would cause him never-ending pain, but he was desperate to keep his leg, despite his ex-girlfriend Stacy Warner trying to convince him otherwise. The rest is history.</span></li><li> "Broken". The Season 6 two-part opener was House kicking his Vicodin habit, courtesy of a mental hospital. It lampshades AND subverts the mental hospital tropes that have been set by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OneFlewOverTheCuckoosNest">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a></em> decades ago. House spends the episode disrupting the ward's system, but realises by the end that he needs their help (opposite to Cuckoo's Nest, where the hospital staff are genuinely sadistic). Even better, the one-shot characters never grated and had viewers longing for their presence afterward. The episode was so wonderfully produced and written, casual viewers could have easily mistook it for an HBO series.</li><li> "5 to 9" (also in Season 6). Viewers get to see a day in the hospital through Cuddy's perspective. It was a refreshing change of pace compared to the usual hectic activity of the hospital. It's also pretty amusing when viewers realize how little importance House's antics are to her day-to-day activities. The only irksome detail was the number of disgruntled patients always calling Cuddy a bitch when they didn't agree with her decisions. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1gbpg');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note1gbpg" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1gbpg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The name-calling is, sadly, quite realistic for a lot of doctors with unhappy patients.</span></li><li> "Two Stories", an intentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to "Three Stories" in the name, in Season 7.

House is happy (and drug-free) because he doesn't need a cane anymore and the leg pain is gone. As you can probably tell, this really doesn't last for long.<ul><li> It happened again in Season 5. House switches to a different drug which allows him to be completely pain free, only to find it compromises his intellect (or so he says).<ul><li> House still had his limp while on methadone, but it was not as pronounced. To what degree House's limp is due to his chronic leg pain or his lack of thigh muscle seems to vary.</li><li> It's interesting: when House's pain was cured by the new treatment after being shot, he was shown running 8 miles to the hospital with no limp whatsoever, a completely new and pain-free man but it was short-lived when the pain returned; but when the pain was completely cured on methadone, he threw away his cane but was still limping. (Strangely, House then <em>quit</em> methadone because the pain "made him a better doctor&mdash;" insert any applicable trope here).</li></ul></li><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>: the reason the leg pain was gone in those episodes was that Hugh Laurie was starting to develop <em>actual</em> pains from walking around with the cane all the time.</li><li> The Season 5 finale.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage">Yiddish as a Second Language</a>: Cuddy's mother.

Of course, it'll be the wrong one. Alternatively, it's the right diagnosis, but other things get in the way - for example a patient is correctly diagnosed as having Strongyloides, but his helper dog eats the pills the doctor in charge gives him. Result - one dead patient who didn't get his medication, one dead dog who did. Another case is House suspects Erdheim Chester's in both an old woman and a young kid in "All In" within the first fifteen minutes, but the tests were screwed up because of the timing and they went through about fifteen other things.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWontFeelAThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWontFeelAThing">You Won't Feel a Thing</a>: In the episode "The Itch".<div class="indent"><strong>House:</strong> You won't feel a thing...
