In the midst of trying to locate him, <em>Voyager</em> was yanked across the galaxy by an alien known as the Caretaker, who was also responsible for abducting Chakotay's ship.

By Season Three, the show was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retool">retooled</a> into something more suitable for family viewing, and the producers had found a winning formula (in keeping with the late-nineties fantasy TV boom) in embracing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">the sillier aspects of Starfleet life</a>.</p><p><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em> was often criticized for going weeks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Soaperizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Soaperizing">without an action sequence,</a> but on <em>Voyager</em> (and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionizedSequel">it is their stock and trade.</a> This was aided in large part by the Delta Quadrant being seemingly the most savage of the four Quadrants; nearly every race the <em>Voyager</em> Crew meet is as xenophobic as they are powerful.

"Basics Pt. II" is the last straw where the show tipped over from being relatively hard sci-fi to a pulp adventure serial. No-nonsense Janeway turns over some rocks and instructs her crew to eat the grubs they find underneath.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>:<ul><li> Most of the elements introduced by DS9's Michael Piller, most notably the Kazon Nistrim, were abandoned after ratings faltered and the other producers agreed that they weren't working. Originally they were angling for a darker, more serialized show like DS9. The big problem is that Piller was no Ron D. Moore. The other problem was that the Kazon were indistinct from Klingons. A third problem was that, even in their original conception, the Kazon were meant to be an allegory for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangBangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangBangers">the Crips and Bloods</a> (right down to the afros) who were harassing some of the crew members in their secluded neighborhoods. The L.A. riots were the context in which the Kazon were designed, and the class tensions led to some racial subtext which permeates the Kazon episodes. It is probably for the best that "Basics, Part II" marks the end of the Kazon as a recurring threat to <em>Voyager</em>, even if that ending was less than graceful.</li><li> <em>Janeway Lambda One</em>. Janeway's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CostumeDrama">Victorian-era holonovel</a> was going to unspool throughout the series. The idea was to show a private side to Janeway and develop her character beyond the limitations of the Captain's Chair, but it was a flop. Critics were getting tired of the over-reliance on the holodeck for stories, even at this early stage. Jeri Taylor said "the fans" didn't share her "appreciation" for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror">gothic horror</a>, instead of recognizing that nerds often love horror, just not her trite version of it.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">Absolute Xenophobe</a>:<ul><li> The unnamed aliens in "The Swarm".

The Doctor objects to this racism, and the episode seems to be building toward an Aesop opposing bigotry ... until it is revealed that the Cardassian doctor, Crell Moset, is actually a war criminal. The episode then turns into a debate on medical ethics, and the racism issue is all but forgotten. The Star Trek franchise is normally very firm in its opposition to bigotry, but this episode actually seemed to imply that the prejudiced characters were <em>right.</em> B'Elanna even acts like the discovery of Moset's war crimes vindicates her earlier hostility toward him. When she says that she had "a bad feeling" about the Cardassian as soon as she saw him, nobody calls her out on the fact that her "bad feeling" was the product of nothing more than her own racial prejudice.</li><li> "Friendship One" has Janeway lament the death of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Carey</span>, noting that exploration can't justify the loss of even one life.

Seven and the Doctor got the most, with their quest for humanity. B'Elanna Torres, Tom Paris, and Harry Kim noticeably "grow up" over the years. In the first season, Tom is cynical, immature, and won't follow the rules; Harry is naive and lets Tom "lead;" and B'Elanna has major anger issues. Over time, Tom gains better morals and learns to fit in, reworking his talent for irony into a sense of humor to lighten the mood for everyone; Harry becomes more confident, and even earns the responsibility of commanding night shifts; and Torres gains better control of her emotions, and even starts to open up to her Klingon heritage.

In the episode "Hope and Fear" the crew meet an alien who can finally translate a Starfleet message that is heavily encrypted - it shows them the location of a Starfleet ship sent using a prototype drive. In this message the admiral is wearing the new uniform: however, the alien has never seen these so it's questionable how he knows that the uniforms have been changed.</li><li> Starfleet ships introduced in <em>First Contact</em> also appear in Seasons 4 and 7.

The only way Voyager can be operated is by merging the two crews and having skilled Maquis take over key positions on the ship. Notably, neither crew has a doctor or even a medic left alive so the Emergency Medical Hologram has to be used all the time, which it was not really designed for. Over the course of the series the EMH develops a distinct personality and starts fighting for his rights as a person.</li><li> Occurs in "Displaced," where crewmen keep disappearing while aliens appear in their place.

Worth noting, however, is that "Voyager" also made effort to show the lower-decks crewmen once in a while. "Learning Curve" focused on Maquis crewmen adjusting to Starfleet regulations; several seasons later, "Good Shepherd" starred three of Janeway's original Starfleet crew who weren't adjusting well to life in the Delta Quadrant; and "Ashes to Ashes," which was essentially about a dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> trying to return to Voyager, also counts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>: While all <em>Trek</em> shows loved to juggle sweeping drama and sci-fi horror with frothy comedy, the pendulum swung to even farther extremes in this case. Janeway was shown on multiple occasions to be willing to contradict her principles, form dubious alliances, and trade dangerous technology to shorten <em>Voyager</em>'s trip. There are also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">numerous episodes where the crew gets messily killed</a>, usually involving time travel, holograms or cloning.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkParody">Dark Parody</a>: In-universe, the EMH sings a parody of "Rock-a-Bye Baby" where instead of falling out of a tree (dangerous, but still a chance of survival) the baby is on an exploding shuttle.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory">Dated History</a>: Used in-universe in "Living Witness".

Say what you will about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">The Dominion</a>, the Gamma Quadrant looks positively hospitable in comparison. Even discounting the Borg, this isn't someplace you'd want to be stranded. The <em>Voyager</em> crew meets a total of <em>two named races</em> (The Ocampa and Talaxians) that aren't at best underhanded and untrustworthy, at worst xenophobic and hostile (And even the Ocampa and Talaxians have a couple of duplicitous factions each), and at least two quasi-fascist empires. Here's the rundown:<dl><dd><ol><li> The Vidiians. If you live near them, disfigured organ stealing space pirates might show up at any time.</li><li> The Hirogen. Savages by choice, with loads of advanced technology. Their favorite pastime is to hunt and kill any other intelligent species they encounter for sport.</li><li> The Krenim. An aggressive, territorial race that manipulates time. We are told that they used to dominate the sector with their temporal weapons.</li><li> The Devore.

Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance">Voyager survives</a>. The reason this is this trope is that Janeway is only acting that way <em>because</em> of the experiments of the aliens</span>.</li><li> The Seska arc introduces a wildly complicated question when Seska reveals that she forcibly stole Chakotay's DNA and impregnanted herself with it, and later begs for his help when she and his son are in danger. How he's supposed to respond to that is agonizingly difficult. To the show's credit, they do spend a good deal of time dealing with these questions (Chakotay decides to try and get custody and raise him after the spirit quest version of his father makes the observation that the boy is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a>), but they're ultimately rendered moot when it turns out that the child isn't actually Chakotay's after all.

Chakotay, the only one originating from the proper timeframe, enlists the help of a Janeway from before <em>Voyager</em> was launched into the Delta Quadrant, injecting her with a special chroniton-infused serum so that she can exist in the other timeframes. Along the way, she begins to learn about all of the crazy stuff that's happened to <em>Voyager</em> throughout its run in the Delta Quadrant and blames herself for it. She wants to modify Chakotay's plan to fix things so that all of <em>Voyager</em> is back in the proper timeframe so that it is instead in <em>her</em> timeframe, and thus she can make it so that it never goes into the Delta Quadrant. Chakotay tells her that she's not seeing the big picture - all of the families and relationsships that have formed on <em>Voyager</em> and how everyone's grown. He also says that it's presumptuous of her to think that she has the right to change everyone's future. Yet, in the series finale "Endgame," this is exactly what happens. <em>Admiral</em> Janeway returns from the future with a plan to get <em>Voyager</em> home. There's maybe about two minutes of hand-wringing about the ethics of this at most, with most of the rest of the story spent on the ironing-out and execution of the plan, the upshot being that it works out exactly as intended and <em>Voyager</em> gets home nearly 16 years before it did in Admiral Janeway's timeline.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DenserAndWackier">Denser and Wackier</a>:<ul><li> The show had its share of corkers, too.<div class="indent"><strong><a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/30vy5e/screw_the_haters_star_trek_voyager_is_where_its_at/">Redditor<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></strong>: Watching <em>Voyager</em> is like returning to your favorite bar to talk about a philosophical concept you once heard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">your smarter, more boring, cousin</a> tell you about.

Supposedly, the bio-neural packs are more efficient at keeping track of the crew (not really, Chell actually complained about that in "Repression") and can pilot the ship better than even Tom Paris, making the helm utterly redundant.

For deep space operations, speeds in the hundereds of km/h would be <em>glacially</em> slow, and the ship may as well not be moving at all, even if it's assumed to be relative speed to a nearby object.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchyVoicedSenior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchyVoicedSenior">Scratchy-Voiced Senior</a>: In one episode, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravelEpisode">Kes keeps travelling back and forth in time</a> and when she's old, her voice becomes deeper and croakier.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecurityBlanket">Security Blanket</a>: According to Paris in "Tsunkatse," B'Elanna takes a stuffed animal named "Toby The Targ" with her whenever she has to be away from <em>Voyager</em> for more than one day.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeenItAll">Seen It All</a>: By the third season, the appearance of being caught in a temporal loop just prompts Janeway to scan for the appropriate particles.

So the "1 in 20, at best" odds of survival may not have looked so bad, especially in light of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">opportunity to at least take the aliens with them</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid">Uneven Hybrid</a>: Tom and B'Elanna's 1/4 Klingon daughter Miral, born in the series finale.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnitConfusion">Unit Confusion</a>: Isotons.

Guy</a>: Tom Paris' father Owen Paris was a Starfleet admiral and Tom never felt that he could live up to his reputation. Things were strained between them and only became worse once Tom had joined the Maquis and then ended up in a Federation penal colony. It was only after the <em>Voyager</em> got lost in the Delta Quadrant and later established communications to Earth that the two re-connected, especially once Tom and B'Elanna became a couple and had a child. In the novels, things became strained between them again due to circumstances in part beyond Tom's control and Owen died in a Borg attack.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamShot">Wham Shot</a>: In the "Unimatrix Zero One" two-part episode, several Borg Drones have created a mental world where they can live as individuals free from the Collective's control.

This includes encountering a race of photonic creatures in a different plane, and another which considers holographic programs to be insurgents. Even what rights the Doctor has on the ship has been explored, with him even trying to resign in one episode.</li><li> By the mid-nineties, the old "peaceful white men vs. brutish brown aliens" was beginning to look suspect. The writers, to their credit, deconstructed this dusty <em>Trek</em> trope in two episodes of note.</li><li> "Nemesis" pits Chakotay against a toothy, hairy, stock warrior race (they're even called "Nemesis" and "Beasts") brutalizing helpless natives who look and sound like nice Europeans. Janeway, while negotiating for his release, beams up some delegates from the planet&mdash;<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and it's a well-bred Nemesis in a dapper suit. The humans on the surface are just figments to entice Chakotay to kill.</span></li><li> In "Author, Author", a Federation book publisher tries to game the legal system to exploit the Doctor (and even the crew's "victory" there fell short of having the Doctor recognized as a person under the law). We also learn that the Federation is using sentient holograms like EMH Mark Is as slave labor.</li><li> In "Living Witness" (yes, this episode again), we see an age-old war from two different historical perspectives. In one, the rubber-headed Vaskans are the traitorous Quislings who sold out the planet in exchange for land. In the Doctor's revised account, the 'human' aliens were indeed the instigators of the bloodbath: the so-called "martyr" of the Kyrians was the one leading the boarding party to attack <em>Voyager</em>. Further muddying the waters is the class division amongst the Kyrians and Vaskans: The prologue is hosted by a Kyrian curator, suggesting that the Kyrians came out on top in the end. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutionFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersecutionFlip">the well-dressed hosts are just "token" Kyrians</a>, elected to give the impression of a balanced debate.</li><li> This angle played into the Kazons' story very early on. The Kazon were once a Slave Race employed by their white masters, the Trabe, and it's stated that the entire galaxy now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMansBurden">rues the day their earned their freedom</a> (erm....). The Kazon are a confused mess of storytelling by writers who intended it as a commentary on redlined city districts and the cycle of crime, but for whatever reason, the species fell back into the famliar "Warlike Alien" role which Trek is used to, and their oppressors were painted with a softer brush. Somebody obviously took notice of this, and sought to rectify it with other races.</li><li> In "The Killing Game", Captain Janeway stops the Hirogen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">Hunting the Most Dangerous Game</a> by handing over their hologram technology. As that episode showed, Voyager's crew already use holo-novels that involve shooting holograms for their own entertainment. At what point do the holograms have rights? Is it when they become so advanced they are self-aware? Because in "Flesh and Blood" it turns out the Hirogen have increased their capabilities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotThinkThisThrough">to make them more challenging prey</a>, until the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">holograms killed the Hirogen</a> and are now on a crusade to liberate all AI holograms. But they discover the issue isn't simple, at one point liberating a crew of holograms whose programming is so simple they can't comprehend their 'liberation'. They literally are talking machines.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>:<ul><li> Seven calls Janeway on this when she and the crew intend to delete memories causing the Doctor to almost literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">BSOD</a> instead of trying to work through his problems psychologically. She wasn't around to object the first time they did it.</li><li> In "Hope and Fear", the alien blames Janeway's decision to back the Borg against Species 8472. As the latter were forced to retreat, the Borg were able to go on and assimilate his world.</li><li> Remember back in the TNG episode "A Measure of a Man" where Picard chewed out Starfleet who were planning to disassemble Data so they could build Androids to serve on Federation vessels, arguing that it was tantamount to them actively perpetuating a Slave-Race? Well apparently Starfleet doesn't, as it's revealed in "Lifeline" that they reprogrammed every single EMH Mk I in the Alpha Quadrant to mine Dilithium asteroids.

Ordinarily, this is not a concern of the VOY crew. However, the museum curator has roped the EMH into this farce by placing culpability for "war crimes" on his shoulders.

If they're 75,000 lightyears from earth, 75,000 x 3 seconds /60/60/24= 2 and a half <em>DAYS</em>, not 75 years.</li><li> In &#147;Timeless&#148;, Voyager makes improvements to the warp drive that would get them home in a couple of days, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">thus ending the show</a>. The new drive creates a Quantum Slipstream that the ship would ride through, but the simulations keep having the ship blow up because it can&#146;t compensate for the fluctuations in the Slipstream. Harry solves this problem by riding ahead of Voyager in the Slipstream in a smaller shuttle craft. He would take readings, calculate for fluctuations, and send those back to Voyager. This is pure nonsense for a lot of reasons, but the one that sticks out (and blew up the ship) was that Harry made the calculations himself instead of programing the computer to do it, which would have saved all the time and prevented all the mistakes. A problem that was not lost on the writers when, in the episode &#147;Fury&#148;, Janeway points out that the computer can plot vectors &#147;a bit faster&#148; than Tom, who is plotting them manually.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronglyAccused" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WronglyAccused">Wrongly Accused</a>: "Ex Post Facto" (Tom Paris is framed for a crime in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoirEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoirEpisode">Noir Episode</a>), "State of Flux" (Joe Carey is framed by Seska before she's exposed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>), "The Chute" (Tom and Harry are imprisoned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">The Alcatraz</a> after being convicted by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a>), "Living Witness" (the Doctor is activated after hundreds of years to find he's received a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalVillainUpgrade">Historical Villain Upgrade</a> and is accused of war crimes), "Random Thoughts" (B'Elanna is accused of spreading aggressive thoughts in a telepathic society that leads to murder).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WroteTheBook">Wrote the Book</a>: In the finale, a future Starfleet instructor introduces Admiral Janeway as "the person who, literally, wrote the book on the Borg."

The use of PADD's (tablet computers) stands out even more in the post-2010 era. In the episode "Hunters", Neelix distributes the first (text only) letters from home personally to each recipient among the crew individually on a PADD, since apparently email has become a lost technology. It is also not unusual to see people using multiple PADD's to multitask, as each can seemingly only run one application at a time. In "Imperfection", Icheb brings <em>three</em> PADD's to the Doctor to show off his original bioscans (which the Doctor should have had on file in Sickbay anyway), his projections regarding the chances of success for a cybernetic surgical procedure and finally one that contains information on DNA resequencing he has designed. To a modern real-world tablet computer user it looks faintly comical.</li></ul></div><hr><dl><dd><div class="indent"><em>"Set course.... for home."</em></div></dd></dl><hr>
