Set in the 24th century, about ninety years after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">original series</a>, the program features a new crew, new perspectives on established cultures (a Klingon Empire as a semi-friendly ally against a Romulan Empire emerging from decades of isolation), new antagonists and a new <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolStarship">Enterprise</a></em> (<em>Galaxy</em>-class starship, registration NCC-1701-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">D</a>).</p><p>After struggling for a few seasons trying to establish itself apart from the original series, it exploded into one of the most well-respected television shows ever made, partially because of a change in direction (its creator had health problems starting around season two of the show's run leading to co-producer Rick Berman taking over most of the show's daily production and his promotion to executive producer during season three) and an increased willingness to experiment with the format and scope of the show, and science fiction as a whole.

Like its predecessor, the series has proved wildly popular in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReRun">Syndication</a>, despite having broadcast its final episode in <em>1994</em>.

The success of the series led to an expansion of the franchise and is single-handedly responsible for the creation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Enterprise</a></em>. TNG, DS9 and Voyager are often called the "Next Generation Era" in discussions regarding the franchise as a whole.</p><p>Though fans will usually agree that the quality of the episodes varies wildly, all but the very worst of the lot usually makes for compelling and thought-provoking viewing. Even boilerplate stories such as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeeFiFauxPas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeeFiFauxPas">clueless foreigner offends alien culture</a>" or "Aliens took my <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridgeBunnies">Bridge Bunny</a>" are handled in a similar manner to TOS, with Picard and company carefully explicating and deliberating over each problem. With the Federation existing in a relative state of calm and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">cowboy diplomacy</a>" no longer a viable option, the challenge is remaining true to Starfleet ideals without resorting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">quick and dirty</a> solutions... and also trying to realize <em>when</em> it's time to get "dirty".</p><p>Although firmly a genre show that aired during an era when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiGhetto">Sci Fi Ghetto</a> was in full effect, <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> was one of the most acclaimed television shows of its day. The episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS1E11TheBigGoodbye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS1E11TheBigGoodbye">The Big Goodbye</a>" won the show a Peabody Award in 1987, the only one ever recieved by a <em>Star Trek</em> show or episode. In 1994, for its final season, <em>TNG</em> was nominated for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EmmyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EmmyAward">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Drama Series, making it the only syndicated program ever to be nominated for that prize (It lost to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PicketFences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PicketFences">Picket Fences</a></em>).</p><p>CBS commissioned <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Okuda">Mike Okuda<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> (who designed several visual elements of the show including the main bridge design and the LCARS system used by the Federation) to oversee <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Remaster">high quality Blu-ray transfers of the entire series</a> from the original film stock to replace the poor quality DVD versions of the series.

In at least two of them, crew members were specifically targeted for abduction because they were Federation citizens, and the Federation had access to plentiful weapons and supplies that they hoped would be traded for the hostages. In all cases, Picard refused to provide any significant aid to the party opposing the ones that took his personnel, citing the Prime Directive as his reason. The problem with that is that the abductors had committed an act of war against the Federation. One group came very close to stealing or destroying the Enterprise, the flagship of the fleet. So the moral of "You have to solve your own problems, rather than finding someone else to solve them for you", became "The strong and principled are good targets, because they won't fight someone so much weaker than them."</li><li> The episode "The Game" attempted to make an aesop that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil">video games are EVIL</a>. However, the game in question (a weird "put disc into bad CGI tubes" game) was actively programmed to brainwash who ever plays it. Also, holodecks are the final form of video games (can simulate ANY scenario imaginable, and stimulate all the senses while doing it), and nobody had a problem with them.</li><li> Picard's actions in "Hide And Q" where as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/SFDebris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/SFDebris">SF Debris</a> points out, the moral is that with with great power <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">Comes Great Responsibility</a>, unless it can be used to save a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfantImmortality">little pink-clad dead girl</a>.</li><li> "The Outcast" as a metaphor for homosexuality... except all the androgynous aliens are portrayed by women, the titular character identifies as a <em>woman</em>, and falls in love with a <em>man</em>. So the story ends up looking more like a heroic straight woman rebelling against lesbian tyranny. This might have been the point (reverse the discrimination to show people what it's like), but it didn't come across quite right. Jonathan Frakes objected to the casting of a woman in the part, arguing that it would be more effective with a man.</li><li> In "Symbiosis", Picard cites the Prime Directive as the reason he cannot interfere, even though the Brekkians are exploiting the Onarans' addiction to the Felicium, believing it to be a "cure" for a plague they have, when it's actually a narcotic. In the end, he decides to give them the drug, but refuse to help them fix their freighters, thus causing them to go cold turkey. Good ending, right? Except Picard seems to overlook the fact that once they go cold turkey and realise the Brekkians have been lying to them for <em>centuries</em>, this would probably result in them declaring <strong>War!</strong> Which is fine with the PD; what they do about their issues is their business<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3m2q4');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3m2q4" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3m2q4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">So it's fine with the Prime Directive, as noted, and also, declaring war is rather useless when the two sides are on separate planets and have no SHIPS</span>.</li><li> The Season 7 episode "Eye of the Beholder" is a bizarre and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CluelessAesop">curiously awkward attempt</a> at an Anti-Suicide PSA, but they botch it by trying to have it both ways. The first act treats the suicide of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">Red Shirt</a> completely seriously, exploring it from all angles, explaining how those that commit suicide often show no obvious signs of distress. It's fairly effective, sort of a forerunner of the subject's similar treatment on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseMD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseMD">House, M.D.</a></em>. And then they completely botch it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaving">Hand-Waving</a> the uncharacteristic suicide as being the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> gone awry, using it as another pitstop in the Worf/Troi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>.

Nikolai Rozhenko is made out to be in the wrong by the characters and the episode never addresses that the main characters (our heroes) were basically ready to let a civilization die out for the sake of a legal document. Not only is this morally unpleasant, it flies in the face of both previous episodes ("Pen Pals") and a later movie ("Insurrection"). The central point of the Prime Directive is that interfering often does more harm than leaving things alone; death is kind of the ultimate harm<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4gmqc');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4gmqc" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4gmqc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Even worse, the civilization is about to be destroyed by a natural disaster-type extinction event - if the civilization had brought about their own ruin somehow, one could have at least cold-bloodedly argued that there was no point in saving such a people that would do this to themselves</span>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourDisabled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuryYourDisabled">Bury Your Disabled</a>: Subverted in "Ethics".

He's even hopeless with women. One particularly cruel episode had an alien taunt his blindness by moving his visor around, just because. The series seems to never let us go on the fact that he's blind (until the movies, well actually he gets taunted again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Generations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Generations">Generations</a></em>, which may or may not have led him to go get cybernetic replacements by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact">Star Trek: First Contact</a></em>.). And apparently his mom disappears as some plot of the week. Worst yet is that nobody gives a damn about his mom afterwards. And to add insult to injury, in Voyager's "Timeless" he tries to stop <em>Harry Kim</em> and fails. Ouch. In one episode, he's heading on his merry way to Risa for some rest, relaxation and poontang.

Gene Roddenberry, it turns out, wasn't so fond of character development. The characters were supposed to inhabit an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">enlightened future</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">conflict is what breeds drama</a>. Some writers left after season 1 due to this and other strange restrictions he had. Characters introduced later in the show's run, Lt. Barclay and Ensign Ro Laren are significantly more complex and, importantly, flawed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">Characterization Marches On</a>: During the early first season, Captain Picard used occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousFrench">Gratuitous French</a> and made references to France. This aspect of the character was dropped, although he's still nominally French.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterShilling">Character Shilling</a>: Multiple examples, but the most well known was that of the shilling done for Wesley, which grated at the fans and became the former trope namer for the more negative and YMMV version of the trope, <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

Apart from shilling Wesley, the story also shills a few other characters, even those who are actually popular like Riker. We are frequently assured that Riker could be a captain on any other ship in the fleet, but without a great deal of backing for the idea.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a>:<ul><li> In the episode "The Defector", one of the coded communications Picard receives is from a Klingon vessel. We don't see the communication and it seems to be a throwaway line in the middle of the episode. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Turns out, he was enlisting the assistance of the Klingons. Three of their vessels joined the <em>Enterprise</em> under cloak through the Neutral Zone and defended them against two Romulan warbirds who attempted to ambush them.</span></li><li> Another example of this trope involving Klingons takes place in "Reunion". We're given our first look at the <em>bat'leth</em> in Worf's quarters and see him showing Alexander the right way to hold and swing it. Later on, a grieving and enraged Worf takes it off the wall again and uses it to exact lethal revenge on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Duras</span> for killing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> K'Ehleyr</span>.</li><li> Something about Klingon weapons just seems to make it impossible to resist using them. In "Suddenly Human", Jono examines a dagger in Picard's quarters, observing that it's Klingon. Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he uses that dagger to try to stab Picard to death in his sleep.</span></li><li> In "Genesis," La Forge and Barclay are accessing circuitry in the Jeffries tube. During dialog, Barclay, for no apparent reason other than to show the audience what he's about to work on, which tips the trope off, twirls a band of brightly-lit power cords like a lasso in his hand. Later, when Picard seeks escape from a frenzied Worf, he uses said cords to electrify the deck to electrocute Worf while Picard sits atop an insulated panel.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChemicalMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChemicalMessiah">Chemical Messiah</a>: The episode "Symbiosis" features a medicine that supposedly cures the race of a planet from some sort of illness. Except that the medicine is really a drug curing them of nothing more than severe withdrawal symptoms! The people believed that it was their last saviour of mankind, but it wasn't. OK, so yes it did cure them at one point, but now the people of the planet had become drug addicts.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChewingTheScenery">Chewing the Scenery</a>: Several aliens, but most notably the leaders of Akmarian Gatherer faction from season 3 episode 9, "The Vengeance Factor".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildMarriageVeto">Child Marriage Veto</a>: In "Haven", Deanna Troi has been arranged to be married to Wyatt Miller.

(Apparently, this is his way of interpreting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman">Officer and a Gentleman</a> trope.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilizationDestroyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilizationDestroyer">Civilization Destroyer</a>: The Borg would not destroy any planet they conquer, but they would assimilate all the sentient life forms in such planet essentially eliminating any form of native culture and civilization.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>: An early episode had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Sufficiently Advanced Alien</a> known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">The Traveler</a> strengthened by the entire Enterprise crew concentrating on making him better.

How advanced it really is isn't firmly established, but it's strongly implied that it's at least a match for the <em>Enterprise</em>.</li><li> In "Devil's Due," the "devil" is simply using technology to simulate magic. Noteworthy in that the technology isn't even <em>sufficiently advanced</em>; it's just been dressed-up to look more impressive than it really is.</li><li> The third season episode "Who Watches the Watchers" again casts the <em>Enterprise</em> crew in the role of the ones with the sufficiently advanced technology, when a botched encounter with a pre-industrial civilization leaves some of them thinking that Picard is a god.</li><li> In "The Next Phase", Ro and Geordi are invisible and intangible after an accident. Ro is at first convinced that they're ghosts now that need to make peace before moving on to the afterlife. Turns out they're just "out of phase" with normal matter, except for the plot-convenient floors (and oxygen).</li><li> Subverted in Q's first appearance, where it is made very clear that Q has the power of a god essentially and is willing to use it to satisfy his own whims, leaving the Enterprise crew completely at his mercy and needing to satisfy the requirements of his game to survive.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cliffhanger">Cliffhanger</a>: One at the end of every season from year 3 onward.

This led to rumors that Patrick Stewart was leaving the show and the episode was intended as a way to write his character out of the series. The first part even sets up a new first officer for the ship. These rumors proved untrue, and at the end of part two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">everything returned to normal</a>, but the story was told so well that few viewers minded.</li><li> At the time, fans seemed to be divided between four possible scenarios: Picard would die and Riker would become Captain, Picard would live but remain a Borg and thus become the show's recurring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">big bad</a>, <em>Riker</em> would die saving Picard's life, or things would return to normal. Quite a few fanfics (and at least one official Star Trek comic) have been devoted to exploring the alternate scenarios. The alternate scenarios are also given a nod in later alternate-timeline episodes, most notably "Parallels".</li><li> The official story is that Stewart was renegotiating his contract and they had to leave it open for the possibility of his leaving. The ending wasn't decided until after the first part was shot.</li><li> Fandom reaction to all the cliffhangers was mixed, most often finding the setup episode wonderful and the resolution episode somewhat lame.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm">Clich&eacute; Storm</a>: Invoked in the episode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS2E12TheRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS2E12TheRoyale">"The Royale,"</a> where Riker, Worf, and Data get trapped in the simulation of a terribly-written crime novel set in the eponymous hotel-casino. Periodically, their attempts to escape are interrupted by scenes from the book, causing the NPCs of the simulation to start reciting the hammiest possible lines to each other (complete with a jazzy soundtrack spontaneously starting up to accompany them), all while the crew looks on in bewilderment.

For example, in "Who Watches the Watchers?", Picard asks Crusher if the Mintakan's memory can be erased, mentioning it's been done before. Crusher replies that she's familiar with Dr. Pulaski's research (as seen in "Pen Pals" with Sarjenka). Then in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part I", when about to join the away team onto the Borg ship, she asks Data what kind of resistance they can expect.

Cut four years later to "Tapestry", when we find out <em>why</em> young Picard started laughing.</li><li> Another example is in Season 7, Episodes 11 and 18 ("Parallels" and "Eye of the Beholder"). In the latter episode, Worf awkwardly discusses the theoretical case of being interested in someone Riker was, had been, or might want to be involved with in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denial</a> sort of way.

The biggest instance of this trope is during the close of Season 7. The episode "Journey's End" establishes the Federation-Cardassian Demilitarized Zone.

Riker seems altogether flummoxed by things such as it helping guide him where he's going. Later on these would be treated as standard for every ship. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in that many may have <em>become</em> standard after being tested aboard <em>Enterprise</em>.</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> In "Heart of Glory", the <em>Enterprise</em> notifies Starfleet that they're entering the Neutral Zone. Notification, not approval. Also, the Visual Acuity Transmitter seen here is never used again.</li><li> "The Samaritan Snare" in Season 2 also has a line of dialogue clearly implying that the Klingons have actually <em>joined</em> the Federation, rather than just becoming standoffish allies (though this was already inconsistent with several previous episodes at the time, and may perhaps have been a reference to an idea that had been rejected before the series began but slipped in by mistake).</li><li> The first appearance of the Trill featured hosts that looked nothing like they did in later series, as well as allowing humans the ability to serve as temporary hosts &mdash; another feature that was forgotten about later on. The episode also seemed to imply that the Trill had very little prior outside contact, although DS9 established they'd been interacting with the rest of the galaxy for some time (one was Sisko's mentor when he was young, and he certainly knew about the symbiont/host relationship). This episode also implies that the mind of the host is completely irrelevant, the mind and intellect almost entirely the symbiont's, and transferring the symbiont to a different host means transferring the same person to a different body. <br><br>After that, it's established that implanting the symbiont into a host creates an inseparable melding of the symbiont and host's minds and that the death of the host is essentially the death of that person, whose mindset and memories continue to exist within the symbiont and then meld together with previous hosts to form the basis of the new mind with the new host. Their avoidance of transporters was also dropped after the first episode.</li><li> The early seasons suggested that the Federation/Klingon alliance was a relatively new development. However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekVITheUndiscoveredCountry">Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</a></em> would show that the alliance officially started 70 years before TNG.

It was essentially to allow an exchange of resources so that the Klingons could deal with the environmental devastation of their homeworld. The formal alliance came later, after the <em>Enterprise-C</em> attempted to save a Klingon colony from a Romulan attack. Of course, in one episode, Wesley's line suggested that the Klingons had actually <em>joined</em> the Federation.</span></li><li> The man skirt, AKA <a class="urllink" href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Starfleet_uniform_%282350s-2370s%29#Skant">the skant<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>. It was created on the reasoning that with complete gender equality, a skirt uniform would have to be unisex.</li><li> Worf, Geordi, and O'Brien are all redshirts. O'Brien has held more job titles than any of them: He begins the series as a helmsman, is promoted to Transporter Chief, and leaves the series a full-fledged Chief Engineer, with no prior mention of his training in either field. (Although he mentions once fixing a Jeffries tube in TNG's "Realm of Fear".) On DS9, O'Brien explains that he discovered a knack for repair work when he was jerry-rigging a transporter beacon during the war with the Cardassians, and the series finale "All Good Things..." retcons his engineering credentials way back during the events of the first season.</li><li> In the first season, Worf acts half-feral. He is highly emotional, resorts to wordless growling when he gets upset, and at one point acts disgusted at anything that even resembles bathing. A far cry from the stoic and disciplined officer he would be later.</li><li> Take away the enjoyable introductions of the senior staff (and a non-advertised cameo by DeForest Kelly!) and you have a boilerplate TOS script masquerading as a series pilot. At this stage of the game Gene Roddenberry is playing it safe and introducing a great deal of Original Series elements to the show &#150; sexism is rife, God-like beings are judging humanity and familiar music punctuates events with urgency. The Farpoint mission brought back the TOS miniskirts and knee-high boots, except with TNG coloring. You'll note also that the hand phasers are smaller here.</li><li> It seems Gene was a little fuzzy on the definition of "android" (as opposed to cyborg), hence a smiling Data who is susceptible to the polywater virus.</li><li> Geordi the helmsman is much less staid than Geordi the engineer and behaves in an almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JiveTurkey">Jive Turkey</a> manner.</li><li> The holographic table in the conference room is pretty nifty but one understands why they stuck to a viewscreen in future seasons. (DS9 ran into a similar problem with the one-episode wonder "holo-communcator", which looked good but took ages to shoot.) Another quibble from "The Last Outpost": Dr. Bev affectionately calls by his first name, "Jean", but leaves out the Luc.</li><li> The first two seasons on a whole have a more low-budget and campy feel to them than the later seasons.</li><li> The Bajorans and Cardassians.<ul><li> The Cardassian makeup was changed after their first appearance in "The Wounded". Initially, their complexion looks more human, with flesh-tone coloring and brown hair, compared to their gray complexion and jet-black hair in later appearances. They also wear very different military uniforms with helmets. One sports facial hair, something that was never seen after that.</li><li> The Bajoran makeup is slightly altered between "Ensign Ro" and later Bajoran characters, and Ro wears her earring on her left ear rather than her right, a practice favored by members of the Pah-wraith cult in DS9.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note049yr');"><sup>Expanded universe&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note049yr" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note049yr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The novels justified the latter as Ro not believing in the Prophets, and wearing her earring on the wrong ear to stop clergymen from trying to feel her <em>pagh</em>.</span></li><li> The Occupation is portrayed as much less severe than in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>.</li><li> TNG makes no mention of the Prophets or the Bajoran religion in general.</li></ul></li><li> Season 2's "Unnatural Selection" takes place at a Starfleet facility in which genetic research is being done to create super humans. It would be pointed out many times in the future, as well as on ''DS9'' and <em>Enterprise</em> that the Federation has a strict ban on any such research being done thanks to the Eugenics Wars.</li><li> In "The Battle", one Ferengi expresses amazement that the Federation would construct their communicator badges out of gold, considering using such a valuable metal for such a utilitarian purpose as wasteful. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>, it's established that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks">gold is actually considered worthless</a> in a society where it can be easily replicated, and that Ferengi only use gold to encase latinum, a rare liquid metal that cannot be successfully replicated.

At one point late in the series it's revealed that space is actually wearing down in those lanes; Starfleet sets a speed limit of warp five to minimize continued damage, but then they weasel out of that by giving authorization to exceed speed limits right and left.</li><li> In the finale, "All Good Things", even relatively low-tech medical ships easily travel at warp 13, even though the Federation's speed limit was warp 5. Either the Federation figured out how to reduce the damage from their warp drives, or the writers forgot about the speed limit.</li><li> The USS Voyager had "variable warp field geometry" to minimize damage to space/time. This is why the nacelles moved before it jumped into warp, but it was stated in later episodes of Voyager and Deep Space Nine that the technology was being retrofitted to older ships with fixed-mounted nacelles. Medical ships traveling at warp 13 are still probably a writer memory lapse, considering that it was stated many times that warp 10 represents infinite speed and requires infinite energy to attain. The only possible explanation for warp 13 would be that they switch to a different speed scale in the future.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9acxx');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note9acxx" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9acxx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This would make sense, assuming they never figure out how to break the warp 10 barrier. A ship's velocity increases asymptotically after warp 9, so there's a major difference between warp 9.999 and warp 9.9999. At some point, they would naturally gain the ability to travel at such high velocities. Restructuring the warp scale by, say, setting warp 20 as infinite speed with an asymptotic increase after 19 would make intuitive sense.</span></li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-trivia.png" class="trivia1 rounded" title="This example contains a TRIVIA entry.

If done properly, this allowed a starship commander to allow his ship to appear in two places simultaneously, because the sensor return from the ship's previous location had not yet gotten back to the enemy ship. This tactic was notably of limited use, only being effective against enemies who did not possess subspace sensors.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedEscape">Hyperspeed Escape</a>: Quite a few times, given the ubiquitousness of Warp Drive in this setting (as a general rule, if you don't have warp drive, nobody in Starfleet is terribly interested in dealing with you anyways).

This may be more out of personal and professional dislike than anything; in the end, when she makes being allowed to wear her earring a condition for staying on, Picard accepts with a grin.</li><li> Dr. Crusher qualifies for this in her application of medical ethics. Repeatedly the way she carries out her duty of care is flawed (self-oriented rather than patient-oriented, and picking and choosing what elements of her duty of care to adhere to as it suits her), her ethical approach is hypocritical or one-sided, often valuing sheer survival over patient autonomy, privacy, rights, their personal and cultural values, and their own choices (patient autonomy being one of the core values of medical care), and even blaming other people - often others she has duty of care over - for their decisions and/or when they are involved with the death of someone under her care (which she has no right to do).<ul><li> In one instance an injured Romulan is brought aboard the Enterprise and requires Worf's ribozomes for neuronal and cellular repair. Worf refuses to donate his ribozomes on grounds of his own morality, and the patient refuses the donation anyway out of hatred for Klingons. Crusher disregards the values of both and their right to choose, and not only repeatedly presses Worf to donate, intending to donate the ribozomes to the Romulan against his will, but she even blames him for the death of the Romulan, repeatedly harassing him over his decision, bringing Worf into sickbay to watch him die, and continuing to firmly blame him afterwards for the death. All of this is in violation of her duty of care as ship's physician and hypocritical in terms of medical ethics.</li><li> In "Suddenly Human" the Enterprise comes across a ship of injured adolescent aliens on a training exercise with a human amidst them, who identifies as one of the aliens and wants to go back with them "home." Crusher sees evidence of past injuries and instead of taking into account the culture - a militant civilization which trains children from a young age to be soldiers/warriors - or what the boy says, or interviewing the other alien boys with him, or evaluating whether the other boys have similar injuries, or asking to speak to the person in charge of the boy's care, she immediately and conclusively determines that the boy was brutalised and abused, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome">Stockholm Syndrome</a>, and needs to be rescued and introduced to a proper "human" way of life. Of course in the end it turns out that the boy was found and brought up by a loving family who didn't ill-treat him, the injuries were a result of the training the boys go through and quite common, and Crusher's assumptions and presumptions were harmful and traumatic.</li><li> In "Ethics" when Worf is injured leaving him paralyzed from the waist down, Dr. Crusher doesn't listen to what Worf wants, his cultural and personal bias, his requirements for adequate quality of life, or respect his autonomy. Instead, she not only condescendingly decides what he should want and what he should do, she compromises one of the core tenants of medical ethics and decides which options for treatment he should want and <em>does not even inform him of all his options.</em> More than that, she compromises the very ideals of the Federation, which in such a diverse society necessarily require respect for other cultures and belief systems. She flat out states, when told Worf will kill himself unless he regains full function, that she'll hold him in confinement until he comes around to the only correct way of thinking, the human way. She even gets angry at the spinal specialist who comes onboard because she <em>does</em> tell Worf all his options, putting Crusher in the position of performing a life-threatening procedure which is outside her comfort zone. It takes Picard having to explain to Crusher her own patient's wishes and needs, which shows just how warped and egocentric her view of medicine has become. Of course Dr. Crusher then goes on to lecture the visiting spinal doctor on her hypocritical medical practices... without realizing how she herself is repeatedly putting her own needs and desires in front of her patient's. Also, her beef with the other doctor, in her horribly misfired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, is with performing experimental procedures that haven't been proven...despite the fact that, multiple times in her career, Crusher has to devise a whole new treatment for some condition that's never been seen before.</li></ul></li><li> In "Attached", the xenophobic Prytt abduct Picard and Crusher, who were attempting to visit the neighboring Kes. In the course of trying to get them back, Riker abducts the security minister who ordered the original abduction. She is outraged. She actually uses the word "outrage".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocrisyNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocrisyNod">Hypocrisy Nod</a>:<ul><li> In "The Drumhead" when Picard proclaims that it's intrusive to use a Betazoid to discern if someone is lying, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral">Admiral Satie</a> throws it right back in his face that he uses <em>Troi</em> to do it all the time. He does point out there's a difference between taking Troi's empathic sense of someone's dishonesty into account with other evidence and using it as the sole basis for an accusation. To his credit, Picard concedes the point and replies that he might reconsider this policy in the future.</li><li> In "Ethics", Dr. Crusher turns on another doctor for trying unconventional techniques to save someone's life, accusing her of choosing which treatments to give based on her own bias. When she questions this doctor's judgement, she says "I made the choice that I thought gave him the best chance of surviving, isn't that what you would have done?" Meanwhile, Crusher is doing the exact same thing in Worf's case: picking and choosing which options to give him...except Worf isn't unconscious, and Crusher is ignoring his opinions and patient autonomy nonetheless.

Mind you, there is a general sense of fashion victimism on the <em>Enterprise.</em> The bridge set feels like the epitome of Eighties luxury, all beige leather seats and wood paneling, and cozy-looking seats that lounge waaay back... given that all they are doing is pushing the odd button on an armrest, it's surprising half the crew doesn't fall asleep.</li><li> The biggest exception, though, is painfully noticeable to the kind of computer nerds who tend to love <em>Trek.</em> In the late 80s and early 90s, the LCARS computer interface looked incredibly slick and high-tech (<em>touchscreen controls?!</em>)... but as of the 21st century, many people would wonder why there doesn't seem to be tabbed displaying, the apparent inability to have multiple applications running at once, and the laughably slow speed at which text appears on screen, line by line, although the latter could easily simply have been implemented as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeGraphicalRepresentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeGraphicalRepresentation">Extreme Graphical Representation</a>.</li><li> The PADDs are another example. While they seemed very impressive at the time, they often fall well short of the capabilities of real-world tablet computers post-2010. For instance, they do not appear to offer two-way communications functionality (in particular video) and, like the main computer stations, cannot seem to run multiple applications. It is not unusual in-universe to see people who are multitasking using more than one PADD, with each one being used for a single task.</li><li> A great in-universe example of zeerust is seen in the episode "Booby Trap". A derelict alien ship that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">1000 years old</a> is discovered in an asteroid field. Picard and the team visit the wreck out of curiosity. The bridge interior looks like something that wouldn't be out of place in The Original Series.</li></ul></li></ul></div><hr><dl><dd><div class="indent"><em>Engage!</em></div></dd></dl><hr>
