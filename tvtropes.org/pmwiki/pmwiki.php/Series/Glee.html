It begins with Ohio high school teacher Will Schuester (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMorrison">Matthew Morrison</a>) attempting to organize his small public school's show choir while dealing with both his personal issues and the torrid personal lives of his students.

They're also constantly pursued by Sue Sylvester (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneLynch">Jane Lynch</a>), the vindictive cheerleading coach who arbitrarily has declared the Glee Club her nemesis. Tons of character stereotypes showed up, to the point of reviving a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Tropes</a>.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>And all the while, they're singing. The first episode alone featured music from such disparate sources as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/GuysAndDolls">Guys and Dolls</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Journey">Journey</a>, and the show went on to showcase everything from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a>. The musical numbers were usually given an in-universe justification with the activities of the Glee club, but just as often sprang fully-formed from the minds of characters in normal situations, as with most musicals. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatRemindsMeOfASong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatRemindsMeOfASong">That Reminds Me of a Song</a> was the order of the day, and in the event that somebody broke into a full-on song and dance sequence with back-up dancers and props and so forth, it was generally assumed that these moments appeared to be taking place at least partially in the individual's thoughts.</p><p>The first episode actually aired in spring of 2009 as a special preview before the actual premier that fall. However it was such a smash hit that the show had a full-season order by the time the other episodes started airing, and was renewed for both a second <em>and</em> third season before the first was halfway finished. The success put most of the cast in the spotlight and led to a touring cast concert, 3D movie of said concert, and reality show spin-off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGleeProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGleeProject">The Glee Project</a></em> where hopefuls competed to land a recurring role on the series.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>However, the show soon became one of Fox's most divisve shows (due to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypeBacklash">Hype Backlash</a>, writing of varying quality, and focusing on a few fan-favourite characters to the detriment of the ensemble&mdash;though YMMV for all of that, of course). Nevertheless it was strong enough to recieve a season four renewal in 2012 and another double-renewal in 2013. It maybe have lasted longer as well were it not for the untimely death of star Cory Monteith in the summer of 2013, a few weeks before the fifth season was due to begin filming. It was later confirmed by Ryan Murphy that the sixth season would be the final season, and it ended on March 20, 2015 after six seasons and 121 episodes.</p><p>The series has had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeCrossover">Fake Crossover</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/archie-glee-crossover-sees-clash-between-riverdale-and-mckinley-1.1374719">with the Archie universe<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> in <em>"Archie Meets Glee"</em>. It also spawned a British singing contest called <em>"Don't Stop Believing"</em> (yes, with the 'g') that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BritishBrevity">lasted six episodes</a> in summer 2010, was won by the only team who sang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbraStreisand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BarbraStreisand">Barbra Streisand</a>, and has never been mentioned since.</p><p>Please add the related tropes to following Sub Pages</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Glee">Character Sheet</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/HoYay/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/HoYay/Glee">Ho Yay</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/Glee">Wild Mass Guessing</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/Glee">Recap</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/Glee">Headscratchers</a>, which is divided into<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeasonGeneric" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeasonGeneric">Generic (Non Season-Specific)</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeCharacters">Character-Specific</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason1">Season 1</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason2">Season 2</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason3">Season 3</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason4">Season 4</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Headscratchers/GleeSeason5">Season 5</a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/GleeTheme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/GleeTheme">Themes</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AwesomeMusic/Glee">Music</a></li></ul><p></p><hr><h2>Tropes Include:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A-B&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: Repeatedly.

Some are the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Socalization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Socalization">Socalization</a>, while others are just plain wrong:<ul><li> Outside the larger cities and their suburbs, the smaller cities like Lima don't have particularly large Asian or Jewish populations. Lima does, however, have a significant Black population, at least more so than we've seen on the show.</li><li> Westerville, the location of Dalton Academy, is a suburb of Columbus and almost 2 hours from Lima. Kurt commuting when he attended Dalton and dating Blaine at leisure must take a hell of a lot of gas.</li><li> Ohio's age of consent law is 16. It technically wasn't illegal for Jeremiah, Blaine's previous crush, to date him and be intimate. It's not unreasonable for an adult to be uncomfortable having that sort of relationship with a teenager, but saying he'd go to jail over it was right out.<ul><li> Since Blaine was retconned to being a sophomore in season 2, he very well could have still been 15 by Valentine's day.</li></ul></li><li> Blaine would have to move to Chicago for the summer if he wants to perform at Six Flags, since Six Flags Great America is the only Six Flags park in that part of the Midwest, as the one in Ohio was sold to Cedar Fair, Inc. in 2004, and then closed in 2007. His better bets would be Cedar Point in Sandusky, or going back to King's Island in Cincinnati.</li><li> The students at McKinley are often seen lounging outside before class during times of the year when it would be way too cold to do so (from late October to mid-April, if you're lucky). In fact, most Ohio high schools don't have much in the way of outdoor accommodations at all for that reason.</li><li> Akron, Vocal Adrenaline's home base, is 3 hours from Lima, making it extremely unlikely that the kids from one town can travel to the other at leisure. And since Akron is basically a slightly-smaller Cleveland, it's also unlikely for Carmel High to have such an outrageous budget for its glee club. Since it hasn't been established who Unique is living with in Lima, it's clear she drives 155 miles every day to go to school.</li><li> Allen County does not have a community college, though this is forgivable since NYADA is equally fictional.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseSports">Artistic License &#150; Sports</a>: The episode "Preggers" gives us the notorious "All the Single Ladies" football play.

In the end, Blaine realizes that he isn't actually bi because he has no chemistry with Rachel. So bisexuality isn't a shield to hide your gayness, it's just brought on by drunkenness! Granted, Blaine's realization doesn't invalidate his point that bisexuality is very much a thing, but it seems like the writers just backed off.</li><li> There seems to even be one in-story in "Born This Way." The word Will writes on the board is acceptance and then tells the kids to make t-shirts about things that make them different and special that they should embrace because they can't change, and most of the kids do that but Will tells Emma that her shirt should have been about her OCD, and while she does need to admit that she's got OCD, it's not something that she should just accept because it can be changed and in Emma's case it really needs to change because her OCD is having severe effects on her ability to live her life.</li><li> In general, a lot of the Aesops concerning bullying, especially when the show seems to take every instance of anti-gay bullying seriously but alternates in whether other forms of bullying are equally serious or something to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a>: In "Unicorn," Kurt is feeling insecure about his masculinity, after learning he may not be a shoo-in for the lead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WestSideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WestSideStory">West Side Story</a></em> as he previously thought, and goes to his dad for advice.

In season two, Kurt and Blaine have their first kiss and it's full, on the mouth. In season three however, both Kurt and Blaine and Santana and Brittany barely show any affection on screen. As mentioned above, Santana and Brittany took over a dozen episodes from becoming an official couple and sharing their first on-screen kiss. The whole thing was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in "Heart" when they got in trouble for sharing a peck in the hallway, while straight couple Finn and Rachel could make out all over the place with no consequence.</li><li> Season Four was pretty much the same, but there was at least an excuse considering all the show's couples were broken up. There were still a couple aversions of this trope however, most prominently in the episode "I Do", which had Kurt and Blaine having a full-on makeout session in the car. In general, in seasons three and four, gay couples would only kiss if it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episode</a>.</li><li> Season Five finally started to avert the trope for real. In the first two episodes of the season, Kurt and Blaine share duets, get engaged in the most over the top proposal ever, share <em>two</em> passionate kisses, and Santana also gets a new girlfriend that she flirts with and kisses on screen. Once Blaine moves in with Kurt mid-season, the trope is practically non-existent. They cuddle in bed, duet, dance, share steamy and casual kisses, have realistic arguments, and their very active sex life becomes somewhat of a running joke. And when Brittany comes back later in the season, she and Santana get back together with a passionate kiss.</li><li> Season Six also averted the trope. Brittany and Santana share sweet moments cuddling in bed, kissing, sharing loving duets, and getting engaged in a simple, but adorable, proposal. Kurt and Blaine, while not even dating, share a <em>very</em> steamy kiss and their break up is a main plot point.

Additionally, one of the most prominent fan theories is that it all takes place in one of the characters' heads whilst they are committed to a mental institute - this character usually Quinn, Finn or Rachel. Out of all the characters, only Quinn and Emma are canonically called and stated to be "crazy" (Quinn: depression and bipolar, according to Sue, Emma: OCD), but the others display many signs of craziness. Sandy could be argued to have clinical delusion and be a stalker, Shelby had postpartum - as did Quinn, as a matter of fact - and Brittany definitely has... something. Santana and Dave both rush through mental illnesses related to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">gayngst</a> in the first half of season 3.

The list could go on.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay">Cast Full of Gay</a>: Despite many characters being cis-hetero, the list of LGBT characters is rather long. By the end of the series there have been three regular characters (Kurt, Blaine, Santana) and ten major recurring characters (Sandy, Dave, Sebastian, Rachel's dads, Adam, Dani, Elliott, Spencer, and Alistair) that are homosexual, a <em>ton</em> of one-shot characters that are queer, plus two transsexuals (Coach Beiste and Unique) and one bisexual (Brittany) in the main cast.<ul><li> Fanfic writers believe Dalton is a SCHOOL full of gay. So do many of the characters, whose reaction upon encountering Dalton or the Warblers for the first time usually has something like 'is this a gay school or just a school that appears gay?' between the lines.</li><li> Plus, there are a LOT of out actors on the show. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisColfer">Chris Colfer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DotMarieJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DotMarieJones">Dot Marie Jones</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneLynch">Jane Lynch</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NayaRivera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NayaRivera">Naya Rivera</a> (implied to be bisexual) and Alex Newell all play main characters, but there have been a ton of out guest stars including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AdamLambert">Adam Lambert</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato">Demi Lovato</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattBomer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattBomer">Matt Bomer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilPatrickHarris">Neil Patrick Harris</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheyenneJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheyenneJackson">Cheyenne Jackson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeredithBaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeredithBaxter">Meredith Baxter</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanGroff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanGroff">Jonathan Groff</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorGarber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VictorGarber">Victor Garber</a>, Ali Stroker and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickyMartin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RickyMartin">Ricky Martin</a>.

This is probably to avoid being the targets of their own group's bullying antics, which involves throwing drinks at nerds, shoving people into lockers, or any other methods of abuse. It's notable that even though Finn and Puck are star players on the team, after joining the glee club, they slowly start to shed from the jerseys, until they never wear them again after senior year (third season). The cheerleaders are also permanently in their uniforms or varsity sweaters, like the football (and hockey) team.

Which is correct (or was at the time), <em>if you include the Glee cast version with the Journey version</em>.

Brittany tries to get her to come to terms with it by encouraging her to be true to herself, but when she explains that she still loves Artie and will not break up with him even though Santana tearfully confessed that she wants to be with her, Santana becomes hostile and angry with her for how she "blew [her] off". While Sue expels Dave Karofsky, who went through a very similar arc, for his bullying, Brittany constantly overlooks Santana's bad behavior even when Artie becomes upset with her and how she doesn't recognize that Santana is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">manipulating her and taking advantage of his insecurities so she can break them up</a>.

Despite Quinn having selfish motives for wanting to reveal the affair, the fact remains that Shelby <em>shouldn't</em> have gotten involved with Puck, a student at the school she works at and if she had lost the job and the child as a result of this, it would have ultimately been her <em>own</em> fault.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>: Multiple characters.<ul><li> Special note goes to pretty much all of the new New Directioners, with Kitty being the only one retained for the final season, although Unique does make a cameo.
