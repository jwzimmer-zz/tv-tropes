This is because <em>Half-Life 1</em> is set in 200X, and Ross doesn't want to step on the timeline's toes. That said, there is some contradiction to when exactly the Mind Series (and its spin-offs) takes place:<ul><li> Some of Freeman's references heavily imply the series takes place very early in the 2000s as opposed to later in the decade, given the lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> references when Freeman discusses the military, law enforcement, and Department of Defense (common topics, given his situation), and Black Mesa using <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrix">Cyrix<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> processors.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3do3v');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note3do3v" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3do3v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The company went out of business in 1997, but it's perfectly plausible that a government office could still be using their products in 2000.

Ross adjusted the damage values in-game so that the marines, who are all carrying body armour of some kind at the very least, go down in three or so shots from the Glock 17 or MP5 as opposed to the ten or so shots it would take in the original game under the reasoning that it makes fights come off as less video gamey. This makes for a slight case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Reality Is Unrealistic</a> when considering that the type of armour issued to modern American soldiers (soft armour backed up by rifle-proof ceramic plates) offers superb protection against rifle rounds; against most pistol rounds, modern armoured soldiers are outright <em>immune</em> bar shots to unarmoured areas.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4gns9');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note4gns9" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4gns9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The <em>Half-Life</em> HD pack fixed this somewhat by replacing the MP5 with an M4</span> It helps though that Freeman tends to shoot the soldiers a lot more than he technically <em>needs</em> to and the game is set in an era where most soldiers wore simple PASGT kevlar vests and helmets without hard plates, which would indeed fail against several closely-spaced 9mm NATO rounds fired from a longer barrel at very close range (which every firefight in Half-Life is). The ones with the ISAPO plate add-on to the PASGT (which at least a few should have) would be pretty much immune to pistol rounds and somewhat resistant to rifle fire, but <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">this can be justified</a> as the lucky few with those plates being the ones he shoots in the head, blows up, etc. Ross also noted in an interview that some of the soldiers Freeman shot are probably still alive thanks to their armour, a fact Gordon echoes later on. However, he doesn't think he's at the point of checking his kills.<div class="indent"><strong>Ross Scott:</strong> Even if you're wearing armour, I don't care <em>who</em> you are; if someone blasts you point blank with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShotgunsAreJustBetter">SPAS-12</a>, you're going down.

Freeman notices this, but is very confused as to why they seemingly wear armour everywhere but their torso, saying that their armour looks like something a stripper would wear.<div class="indent"><strong>Gordon:</strong> Are we being invaded by strippers?

A lot of humour comes from Gordon's reactions to the soldiers' stupidity. While some of it comes from scripted sequences, like the friendly fire artillery barrage in Episode 13 and the odd (to say the least) ambush in Episode 29, there's plenty that's just a result of the AI, the most usual ones being soldiers killing each other with grenades, or running straight at Freeman around a corner even after seeing their buddies getting shot around the same corner.</li><li> In Episode 22, two soldiers run straight into their own trip-mines.<div class="indent"><strong>Gordon:</strong> You know it's probably the military who put these trip-mines here to begin with, and they just go and run into them! I don't get it. They bomb each other, they can't figure out who the civilians are, and they can't duck. I mean look how easy this is. <em>[ducks under a trip-mine laser]</em> Power slide! <em>[slides under another laser]</em></div></li><li> Episode 30 had three Marines blowing each other up with grenades, making Gordon wonder if he just came across <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>. He thinks that he could see Moe just lose it and kill the other two.</li><li> Another time, Freeman encounters a soldier in a hallway and, after shooting him about a dozen times, sarcastically compliments the soldier for his brilliant plan of attacking him in an empty hallway with no cover or room for hiding. Then he walks over and figures out that the door the hallway led to was actually open.<div class="indent"><strong>Gordon:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmFailure">Huh. So I guess that really was your plan.</a></div></li><li> He thinks that natural selection is making them smarter, though. He's genuinely surprised when one soldier DOESN'T just blindly run around the corner and shoot him again, instead chucking a grenade.</li><li> In Episode 47, he witnesses an IFV hitting one of its own soldiers with its cannon in an attempt to kill Freeman, who wasn't even near the blast.<div class="indent"><strong>Gordon:</strong> Man, I'm NEVER joining the military.</div></li><li> It gets even <em>worse</em> in Episode 58, when Gordon takes a teleporter trip over to "Uplink" (a.k.a. the <em>Half-Life</em> demo). The AI there is even more unpolished, leading to things like soldiers blowing themselves up with their own grenades. Gordon concludes that either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">the soldiers are covering up their own cover-up</a>, everyone's on drugs, or everyone is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">just that stupid</a>.

I thought I would feel weird about killing all these people, but really, I don't. That's because they're all pricks and deserve to die! I'll make a speech at their funerals if someone wants me to. I have no problem with going up to a grieving widow and telling her "I'm sorry for your loss... but your husband was a ratfuck meathead who tried to kill me for no goddamned reason because he was too stupid to figure out what the word 'civilian' means.

A good dozen episodes later he fights aliens in a freezer and notes they couldn't come from a swamp planet, because they wouldn't be able to survive in such conditions.</li><li> Near the end of On A Rail, he says that everyone who is wearing a military uniform is now a free target. At the beginning of Apprehension, he sees a soldier off in the distance and yells "Ah! Uniform!

Six years later in real world time, in Episode 49, while crawling through a pipe, a soldier attempts to kill Freeman by throwing a satchel in the pipe Freeman is crawling through.

In Episode 52, a missile explodes near him, causing a similar ringing.

Especially when he's speculating on how the <em>other</em> scientists wearing the same suit as him and carrying the same weapons probably died (e.g. killed by the Gonarch, beaten to death by Vortigaunts, gored on the floor after falling off a ledge or out of the sky...).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBodyParts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBodyParts">Cloning Body Parts</a>: Gordon muses how he would like to clone individual body parts of a stranger and then spread them across a town over a few months; creating the illusion that someone is getting slowly chopped up by a serial killer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">Cluster F-Bomb</a>: Expect Gordon to carpet F-bomb the area with plenty of screaming to got along with it whenever he gets ambushed or almost dies.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdSniper">Cold Sniper</a>: Commented on by Freeman regarding the snipers he comes across during his trek through Black Mesa.

Krim, the creator of that series, requested that this line appear in the main series, but Ross Scott decided it would be too obvious, plus confusing for anyone not familiar with the spinoff, so went with something more unexpected.

In Episode 10.5 he dies because of picking up the shotgun, leaving him too encumbered to make a jump. Later, he puts down the Gluon Gun because it's too heavy for the use he gets out of it. However, just before getting teleported to Xen, he happily takes the entire cache of weapons plus the bulky Long Jump Module.

On the other hand things like heavy machine gun rounds, alien melee attacks, and explosions are indicated to be instantly lethal, assuming Gordon gets hit by them, which again is unlike the actual game, where even rocket launchers and tank shots can't kill Freeman in one hit, and can be shrugged off by simply picking up a couple medkits after.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncompetenceInc">Incompetence, Inc.</a>:<ul><li> Black Mesa appears to be this to Freeman.

However, other times he takes a careful aim and snipes a target from a considerable distance with little effort. He also has no trouble operating or reloading his weapons, even those that he's never seen before like the Gluon Gun. According to his monologue, he's never fired a gun before the resonance cascade incident, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowMortalKombat">learned all he knows about guns</a> from watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> multiple times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceSpoiler">Interface Spoiler</a>: The credits of Episode 68 cite footage from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the "G-Invasion" mod</span>, which is nowhere to be seen in the episode itself (or, for that matter, any other episode in the series).

Ross has stated that this is because, in this version of the <em>Half-Life</em> universe, the suit is impervious to low-calibre rounds. Gordon has repeatedly expressed his amazement at the durability of the suit.</li><li> As the series goes on, Gordon increasingly disregards small-arms fire and alien projectiles, while continuing to take high-calibre gunfire, explosives, and artillery seriously. As well as giant monsters (e.g. Gargantuas). And anything that comes near his head. At one point he comments that he hasn't been shot enough times to scrape the paint off his suit, which suggests that there's a kinetic threshold below which the thing is completely impenetrable.<ul><li> Rifle rounds are able to dent the suit and leave welts and bruises on the wearer, implying that the soldiers could take him down with mere body shots if they packed assault rifles and shot him enough times.

In one episode, he shoots down a helicopter with an MP5. He spends the beginning of the next episode pondering how that's even possible. In another episode, he rams a series of concrete bollards with a tram, expecting nothing more than that the tram will explode, while it instead plunges right through without slowing down. He eventually concludes that the bollards must have been made of Styrofoam.</li><li> In Episode 45, he's pleasantly astonished at managing to somehow destroy a tank with a submachine gun.<div class="indent"><strong>Gordon:</strong> I'd love to do a ballistics simulation to try and come up with a theory as to how shooting a tank with <em>bullets</em> can make it explode.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>: Freeman wishes he could be one.<div class="indent"><strong>Gordon:</strong> Working in an underground lab is pretty cool.

Both of these are obviously unrealistic, but the latter is particularly notable because said Bradley had just (realistically) taken dozens of rounds of small arms fire and three grenades without taking any damage. This is of course because the tanks and IFVs in <em>Half-Life</em>, just like every other enemy, could succumb to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> from any weapon, including the <em>crowbar</em>. Though these ones would only take damage from hits to the turret; their bodies were invulnerable.

He has to settle for using the mounted machine gun.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeChicken">Tastes Like Chicken</a>: One of Freeman's rants is against those who claim everything they haven't tried tastes like chicken, and he emphatically states that the giant tentacle he just barbecued likely tastes <em>nothing</em> like chicken.

He also criticizes the soldier who fires missiles at him from a mounted launcher in a tunnel, which could collapse.</li><li> In Episode 41, Gordon recruits a scientist to open the door leading outside, but first has to get past a couple of spinning blades. Gordon easily moves through them and tries to coach the scientist to do the same. The next thing you hear is *SPLAT*. Gordon is annoyed.

In Episode 35, he can't remember the events of the previous day or so, including the resonance cascade scenario. It's not until halfway through Episode 37, after he faces a bullsquid, that he really starts to remember all of what had happened, but for some reason he has false memories of it being caused by a Lovecraftian cult.

For example, in Episode 10, he doesn't even seem to care that zombies can punch right through concrete walls, even though that would be very bad for him if they ever got close. In Episode 46, he can't even bring himself to utter a "What the fuck?" when he sees an <em>entire missile testing facility</em> turned into a giant trip-minefield by the "rescue team".

Usually lampshaded, like when he speculates that the surprisingly-flimsy concrete barriers are actually just Styrofoam.<ul><li> In Episode 0, he lampshades the stupidity of having to jump from a great height onto a target painted on the concrete floor during the Hazard Course. The idea in the actual game, of course, is to demonstrate what kinds of falls will actually hurt. In this series, Gordon decides to simply lie about finishing the test, assuming his supervisors will be too lazy to check.</li><li> Stand out examples include making a running jump across an elevator shaft onto a ladder and running through an open area and strafing to dodge while a Bradley fires its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">25mm autocannon</a> at him.

This means he often misses supplies and ignores areas most gamers would explore. Notably, he skirted the room where the first shotgun is located, and so did not find one until two full chapters later. He also avoided picking up the Tau Cannon, an extremely powerful weapon, in part because it was covered in blood and body parts at the scene of a recent explosion. The other part, though, was that he'd heard the scientist and guard talking about it...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">and getting killed from it overcharging</a>.

Season 2 of <em>Freeman's Mind</em> leaves it ambiguous if <em>Barney's Mind</em> is in the same continuity (not only does Barney sound different, but Gordon also doesn't recognize Barney when <em>Barney's Mind</em> claims that Barney was Gordon's best friend and college roommate), despite a whole episode being devoted to Ian's Barney conversing with Robin's Shephard.

As far as he's concerned, he just saved the guy's life and the thanks he gets is a gun pointed in his face and a boot out the door, which leaves him utterly baffled. He decides that the only explanation that makes sense is that the Vortigaunt was the guy's slave, and the guy was simply angry about his personal property being destroyed, as anyone else would be.</li><li> Gordon himself complains about Alyx saving him because she killed five cops, not realizing they are already on a full manhunt for him anyway, and doesn't quite get that Barney bailed him out at a checkpoint, solely complaining about the lack of directions to Kleiner's lab.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKillerManhunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CopKillerManhunt">Cop Killer Manhunt</a>: Lampshaded by Gordon. After Alyx murders the Civil Protection officers beating him up, Freeman berates her for it, noting that killing a police officer means they will come after you with greater force and intensity. When he's hunted by the Civil Protection in the train station, he assumes that it's due to a "guilt by association" thing, and he's only making it worse by defending himself.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">Cutting the Knot</a>:<ul><li> Done unwittingly after discussing the trope with the actual trope namer (saying you just look like a brute that couldn't solve it the right way; to be properly deified, you would need to untie it, then just cut it in half for the hell of it right after), early into episode 8. What he needed to do was turn a valve to flood the sewer he was on, and swimming out a pipe that he couldn't reach with the current water level. What he <em>did</em> do was accidentally hit an explosive barrel while trying to kill a manhack, causing a chain reaction that wrecks the entire place and shatters the pipes, causing the needed flood (which is impossible in-game).</li><li> In the same episode, Gordon is presented with a fallen power line electrifying an empty container blocking the way, in which he would need to make it through without touching the walls even once to survive. Gordon decides to simply back up a bit, follow the fallen line and shoot its respective transformer until it goes off, leaving a safe, non-electrified passage (again, something that is impossible to perform in the game).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathGlare">Death Glare</a>: Initially, Gordon refuses to put on the hazard suit because it gives him bad memories, but acquiesces after seeing the way Kleiner is looking at him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontAskJustRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontAskJustRun">Don't Ask, Just Run</a>: Gordon is a firm believer that if you see a whole bunch of people all screaming and running in the same direction, then they probably have more information than you do and you should probably follow their example.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWrongRight">Do Wrong, Right</a>:<ul><li> Gordon is miffed when he thinks the Vortigaunts are being used as personal slaves. Not because he disapproves of enslaving them (he enthusiastically approves of <em>that</em>), but because making them <em>personal</em> slaves is something he feels is irresponsible and unsafe, presumably because it would be easier for them to rebel that way.</li><li> Gordon finds the actions of Civil Protection to be counter-intuitive; they destroy rebel bases instead of just letting them all congregate in one spot and get picked off all at once, or set up outposts along the canals for would-be members to get lured to their deaths at. He likens it to stomping on cockroaches heading to their nest instead of following them to their home.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a>: Gordon at one point muses he's being used as a scapegoat because he's not a political dissident people are rallying behind.

In particular, he dislikes Barney's flippant attitude, as he regards the former security guard as mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a>.</li><li> Averted with Kleiner, who does properly recognize Gordon's contributions. Gordon especially likes how Kleiner says that "trouble follows in his wake," as it means that he's the victim of it, not the cause.</li><li> Hilariously, Gordon misses Breen's speech about him becoming a Messianic archetype for the resistance. Gordon keeps thinking Barney and G-man are psychos who are using Gordon as bait to fulfil some other goal instead of having absolute trust in Gordon's ability to succeed no matter the odds. He also complains about women showing interest in him only to instantly turn cold towards him when they talk to him. This despite it being very obvious that Alyx has minor hero worship for him.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong">Entertainingly Wrong</a>: Gordon assumes that he's just a nobody who nobody is rallying behind and the local dictatorship can make up any story they want to make him into a scapegoat.

Gordon guns down the first friendly Vortigaunt he meets under the assumption that it's hostile, earning the ire of the human it was working with. He assumes the Vortigaunt was the guy's slave.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a>: Ross is playing a custom mod that allows for moments where Freeman does something completely different than what was expected.

Two problems with that. One, any armoured helicopter is going to bare minimum be proof against 7.62x39mm ball and 5.56x45mm ball (some of the most common rounds in the world) which, as rifle rounds, have far greater penetration than nearly any pistol round (bar novelty guns and certain tungsten sub-calibre penetrators), to the point that a weakened subsonic 5.56x45mm round can still zip through <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZxMkV0XeoQ">multiple class III-A<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> vests like so much paper when just one of them can stop a .44 magnum round cold. Two, the MP7's 4.6x30mm rounds, while not as penetrative as high powered rifle rounds, still have better penetration than most pistol rounds (including .44 magnum) due to their 700-800 m/s muzzle velocity and steel cores. Though, because the Hunter-Chopper is likely constructed of a similar material to other Combine technologies and structures, any form of small-arms fire likely won't even make a dent, to begin with.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HearingVoices">Hearing Voices</a>: Freeman begins to suspect he is when he hears a Breencast speech before he discovers the source.

He proceeds to brag about solving the problem, which makes him a hypocrite on two fronts: 1. That he "cheated" by his standards and didn't solve the problem the right way, and 2. He didn't even solve the problem himself, it got solved <em>for</em> him purely by accident. Later in the episode, Gordon continues his hypocrisy by <em>deliberately</em> cutting another knot in his path. Both times, Gordon does something that isn't even possible to do in the actual game, so he <em>definitely</em> isn't solving his problems the right way!</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IconOfRebellion">Icon of Rebellion</a>: Gordon figures out that the Lambda symbol is one for the Resistance, and promptly goes into a rant about how stupid it is to tag every rebel location or ammo dump with it since if he was able to figure it out that easily, the authorities most definitely can too and can use it to identify Resistance strongholds and secret areas.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy">Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy</a>: In Episode 10, Freeman lampshades the poor aim of a CP officer by calling him a stormtrooper in the making and nicknames him "Darth Uzi".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsBeyondSaving" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsBeyondSaving">It Is Beyond Saving</a>: Gordon ponders this about Earth when he sees nearly a dozen barnacles grouped up in a sewer.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">Laser-Guided Karma</a>: Gordon is ecstatic when he finds a Vortigaunt being forced to sweep the floors. Short of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation">mounting their heads on spikes</a>, he couldn't have asked for a better outcome. He's also delighted to see trash littered everywhere, thinking people are doing it on purpose just to make the aliens clean it up.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForMasturbating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForMasturbating">Mistaken for Masturbating</a>: Done with dialogue. When Barney comments that he's behind on his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">beating</a>" quota, Gordon quips "Pervert."</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookChivalry">Mook Chivalry</a>: At the start of his escape, when he is armed with nothing but a crowbar and being shot at by multiple cops, he thanks one of them for coming at him with a stun baton.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a>: Gordon seems to truly respect Kleiner, despite his usual caustic, misanthropic attitude towards everyone else. Although some of this "respect" seems to stem from fear, as he remembers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">a very different Kleiner from the one we get to see</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneSolution">Mundane Solution</a>: When Gordon has trouble with the boat ramp in the canals, he backtracks a bit to take some boards off a post and nail them to the empty section of the ramp, extending it so he doesn't have to jump as far. Again, not something you can do in the game.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NestedMouths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NestedMouths">Nested Mouths</a>: Gordon comments on this feature of the barnacles after killing one, then notes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtEvolution">he doesn't recall them having it before</a>.</li><li> <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry. It should be moved to the YMMV tab."><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareRetardant">Nightmare Retardant</a>: Gordon turns manhacks, a prime source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> in the original game, into this through judicious application of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>. He points out that their AI is extremely primitive, only being able to fly towards moving targets, and as such, they will always be defeated by a chain-link fence or a guy with a baseball bat.<div class="indent"> <strong>Freeman:</strong> This is redneck technology! ... This was invented by some guy duct-taping a circular saw to a remote-control helicopter to keep people off his property.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">Noodle Incident</a>: Gordon's life keeps getting more interesting even before it all went to hell.<ul><li> He remembers Kleiner as something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleporterAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleporterAccident">the cat incident</a> from the game is brought up, Gordon is dismissive of the whole topic, knowing for certain the cat died and finding <em>nothing</em> weird or unnerving about it, implying more research along the same lines. And he's almost killed Gordon before in different experiments.</li><li> Gordon was a college can throwing champion to the point a Metrocop's attempts at bullying him fall flat because Gordon thinks he wants to see the master at work.</li><li> During a rant, he admits to himself he once attacked a cardboard cut-out at a shoe store.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a>: While trying to shoot a manhack, Gordon accidentally hits an explosive barrel, which he knows explode with ridiculous ease, in a cramped sewer room stacked to the ceiling with them. He has enough time to notice the flames after the manhack is down.<div class="indent"><strong>Gordon:</strong> <em><span class="font-s">Uh-oh...</span></em></div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneITrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneITrust">The Only One I Trust</a>: In the first episode, Gordon admits that Kleiner is the only person he trusts at this point. Considering how little respect Gordon usually has for other people, that's saying a lot.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Police Brutality</a>: Freeman notes that the Civil Protection officers didn't even bother to shout "Freeze!" at him before opening fire.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight">Rant-Inducing Slight</a>: When Barney sarcastically comments that Gordon's MIT degree "really pays for itself" as he does some basic tasks for Kleiner, Gordon snaps at him to fuck off, reminding Barney that he's (seemingly) a High School dropout and that Gordon helped build the teleportation tech in the first place. He spends the next minute in a foul mood before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Lamarr accidentally screws up the teleportation process</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidFireNo">Rapid-Fire "No!"</a>: Gordon's reaction in Episode 11 when he sees the canal gate closing.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">Remember the New Guy?</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a>. While Barney knows who Gordon is, Gordon has no idea who Barney is. He doesn't recognize Dr. Breen either. He does, however, <em>immediately</em> recognize Dr. Kleiner and seems to think well of him, despite not having mentioned him at throughout the previous series. Ross Scott justified this in a fan chat when he explained that Barney is not mentioned anywhere in the original game, whereas Kleiner is at least mentioned in the manual as part of Freeman's backstory. Going on the canonical sources and taking them at face value, there's no reason to expect that Freeman knows Barney. He also has no memory of Breen or Eli Vance for the same reason.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Sarcasm Mode</a>: Alyx calling Gordon a "man of few words" is played as this since in this series Freeman doesn't shut up.<div class="indent"><strong>Freeman:</strong> <em>Yeah</em> I talk a lot, but that's because <em>I get things done</em>.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScapegoat">The Scapegoat</a>: As mentioned under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntertaininglyWrong">Entertainingly Wrong</a> above, Gordon believes he's just some random guy nobody has ever heard of that the goverment is using as a scapegoat purely out of convenience, ignorant of the fact that the Resistance practically worships him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>: When Gordon sees a train run down a cop without even trying to brake, he assumes they must be really serious about their schedules.<div class="indent"><strong>Freeman:</strong> Arrival times are the word of <em>God</em> here.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In addition to the <em>Shepard's Mind</em> shout-out in Episode 61 of season 1, Episode 5 of season 2 reveals that <em>Freeman's Mind</em> takes place in the same continuity as Ross Scott's other series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/CivilProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/CivilProtection">Civil Protection</a>.</em> The jury's still out on his Source shorts <em>Galaxy Gulp</em> and <em>A Stranger in Need.</em></span></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">Shown Their Work</a>: In Episode 7, Gordon complains that the new handgun and submachine gun use different calibres, while the ones at Black Mesa used the same calibre. In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em>, the handgun was a Glock 17 and the submachine gun was a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10djes');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note10djes" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10djes');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">MP5SD3 specifically</span>, which both fire 9x19mm Parabellum bullets and share the same in-game ammo pool. By contrast, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em>'s handgun is a Heckler &amp; Koch USP Match (which uses 9x19mm Parabellum bullets) and its submachine gun is a Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 (which uses 4.6x30mm bullets), so they use separate in-game ammo pools. In short, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">leaning</a> on some cross-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">The Stoner</a>: In Episode 9, Gordon suspects one is responsible for planning his route.<div class="indent"><strong>Freeman:</strong> (In a stereotypical stoner voice) Yeah, he'll be like Evel Knievel, except like, on the water, <em>maaaan</em>!</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideoGameGenerosity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciousVideoGameGenerosity">Suspicious Video-Game Generosity</a>: Gordon is deeply suspicious, and slightly unnerved, at the discovery of random ammo packs that happen to be strewn across his path. Especially since the packs are always the right calibre for his gun. May double as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to when he mused on the possibility of being a cosmic pawn in the first series. He eventually concludes that the cops are <em>so</em> trigger-happy that they just walk around carrying these big boxes of ammo everywhere and sometimes drop them accidentally.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a>: In Episode 14, Gordon rants (again) about reality collapsing since he was supposed to die but didn't, and decides that he's going to take all of reality down with him if that's the case.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">Tempting Fate</a>: At the start of Episode 13, Freeman thinks the calm following the previous episode is prelude to a plane passing overhead and bombing him, noting that it's what he'd do. He then spends the rest of the episode outrunning an <em>attack chopper</em> bombing (and shooting) him.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureAlwaysWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureAlwaysWorks">Torture Always Works</a>: Gordon confidently states that he would fold under torture and switch sides if he was captured and threatened with it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncertainDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncertainDoom">Uncertain Doom</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/CivilProtection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/CivilProtection">Mike and Dave</a> run past a sewer grate Freeman is looking out of in Episode 7</span>, and shortly afterwards, Gordon is ambushed by several CP officers.

Since he's currently being pursued by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerCop">Metrocops</a> in a train yard, he muses that the trains <em>would</em> run on time if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">being late</a> meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">getting shot</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VomitIndiscretionShot">Vomit Indiscretion Shot</a>: In Episode 5, Gordon pukes his guts out after freeing himself from a Barnacle's strangling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">Neck Lift</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastebasketBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WastebasketBall">Wastebasket Ball</a>: When Gordon encounters the "Pick up that can!" Civil Protection officer, one might expect him to take the route of most players and throw the can in his face instead of putting it into the trash as ordered. Instead, he is only too happy to comply with the order... by making a magnificent shot into the trash from the other side of the room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">He didn't even realize that the officer was trying to bully him</a>; he thought the can-throwing skills that he honed during his college years were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">just that famous</a></em>, and that the officer was simply asking the master for a demonstration.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction">We Need a Distraction</a>: After the failed teleport, Gordon is sent out alone by Barney with nothing but a crowbar and his orange Hazard Suit for protection.
