It centers on the Fox family, a reasonably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily">average 3-child household</a>. Most of the humor comes from the characters or commentary on pop culture, occasionally both at once.</p><p>The five main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Foxtrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/Foxtrot">characters</a> are each known for their various defining quirks. Peter starves himself for three days before each Thanksgiving and is an overall <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">Big Eater</a> to the extreme. Paige has an imaginary boyfriend named Pierre who factors heavily into her dream life (the strips involving him usually repeat the phrase "Ooh, Pierre!" a lot and end with a panel outside the dream, where Paige is sleeping and Jason has Quincy (a pet iguana) pressed to her lips or the like). Jason plays <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> with his best friend Marcus, but their battles are usually against fictitious versions of Paige. Andy, the health-conscious mom, tries to sneak tofu into their diet on a regular basis (and doesn't like the thermostat set above freezing). Roger, the techno-fossil dad, should never be allowed to plan vacations. Ever. And Jason occasionally draws a comic book called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue">Slug-Man, whose nemesis is the evil Paige-o-Tron</a>.

Neelie" for three weeks, and he's shocked that not only is the player a girl, she is his "real-life nemesis", Eileen. She later reveals that she knew his username from the get-go and had tricked him to prove a point (that they could be friends if it weren't for his real-life hang-ups).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingUnnatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActingUnnatural">Acting Unnatural</a>: Paige and Nicole shoplift a CD. Nicole tells Paige to act naturally. Paige holds her breath. Nicole tells Paige that acting naturally includes breathing. Paige immediately starts loudly panting as Nicole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacePalm">Face Palms</a> and adds "Quietly".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">Adult Fear</a>: Paige has never been the best babysitter when watching Katie for Ms. O'Dell, but this Trope <em>truly</em> came into play when she dozed off while watching her and Katie started playing with scissors. (Fortunately, Paige woke up before a disaster happened.)<ul><li> In one series of strips, Roger comes home from a business trip only to find out that Jason was hit by a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hot Wheels</span> car while he was gone. Roger is so badly rattled by the event that he temporarily quits his job in order to spend more time with his family; to his family's (and his co-workers') relief, he realizes this was a mistake and goes back to work.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffairHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffairHair">Affair Hair</a>: Andy thinks she finds one on Roger's jacket during an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfCharacterMoment">uncharacteristic fit of jealousy.</a></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a>: Of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em> when Jason attempts to fill in for Aaron Mcgruder, despite knowing nothing about "African American Culture" or "Politics".</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles">Afraid of Needles</a>: Roger, in a story arc that ran after 9/11, decides to give blood despite being afraid of needles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCheeringAllTheTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCheeringAllTheTime">All-Cheering All the Time</a>: When Paige was trying out for cheerleading, she started using cheers all the time; including giving a (correct) answer to a question on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter">The Scarlet Letter</a></em> in English class.<ul><li> And when Paige was on the JJV (junior junior varsity) cheer squad, she was sent to cheer at events like chess matches and debates.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>: Several strips have the characters dreaming an absurd situation (Jason giving Andy the keys to a fancy car and vacation tickets because she raised his allowance to $15,000 a week &#151; then cut to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that he's whispering into her ear to manipulate her dream).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">Aluminum Christmas Trees</a>: A strip from the early '90s has Jason sending a suggestion to Disney about a planned theme park in Virginia. Disney <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_America">really did have plans to do this<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> at the time.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Always Someone Better</a>:<ul><li> Eileen is this to Jason. She seems to trump him at everything (schoolwork, video games, you name it), much to his rage, and his attempts to one-up her always end in disaster. The fact that she has a crush on him only makes it worse.</li><li> This is sometimes taken to ridiculous extremes. In one strip, Jason found a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLeafClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLeafClover">Four-Leaf Clover</a> right before class started, and then gloated to Eileen how it would help him get the highest grade on the math test... And then Eileen found a <em>five</em> leaf clover. In the last panel of the strip, Andy is yelling at Jason because he apparently flunked the test because he missed it, because he was spending the whole time searching for a clover with more leaves.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazinglyEmbarrassingParents">Amazingly Embarrassing Parents</a>: Andy becomes one in an early story arc in which she is tapped to write a column about family life for her newspaper. Much to the kids' chagrin, she shares embarrassing stories about them while using their real names, leading to their being mercilessly teased at school. She finally bows to pressure and agrees to publish her column under a pseudonym.<ul><li> Andy's mother is this to her by the virtue of being, as described by the <em>New York Times</em> itself, "perfect".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a>: Whenever Paige beats Jason up, he has broken glasses.<ul><li> Peter wearing a catcher's mask so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterMuffykins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterMuffykins">Fauntleroy</a> couldn't bite him? Sure, it was worth a shot. Crouching down and taunting Fauntleroy to do his worst? Not such a great idea.<div class="indent"><strong>Peter:</strong> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">[speaking through a layer of bandages</a>]</em> Did you know that some dogs' heads are smaller than a baseball?</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">Analogy Backfire</a>:<ul><li> Occurs in an early story where Jason becomes interested in trading commodoties, then asks Roger for advice:<div class="indent"><strong>Roger:</strong> The basic idea behind commodoties trading is that you're trying to predict whether something will become more scarce and thus <em>more</em> valuable, or less scarce and therefore <em>less</em> valuable. For example, if you thought space aliens were going to come and take away half the world's cows, you might want to load up on cattle futures, since the low supply would send their value through the roof. <br><strong>Jason:</strong> Space aliens?

Since then, the strip hasn't really broken the fourth wall at all, but it has come very close at times:</li><li> In one of the first Sunday strips, that very strip's splash panel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality">is shown on a newspaper that Roger is reading</a>.</li><li> Early in the strip's run, the "F" in the strip's splash panel logo featured Quincy resting on it, having already taken a bite out of the "F." In one strip, Peter was blowing on a barbecue grill in the splash panel, and the smoke was drifting in the direction of the logo, resulting in the Quincy on the logo coughing.</li><li> In one arc, Peter and Jason discuss what would happen if a cartoonist got sick &mdash; would he draw stick figures, try to Photoshop the strip, etc.? &mdash; and their suggestions are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">reflected in the final panel</a>.</li><li> Another example of this is a discussion between Andy and Roger talking about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert">Dilbert</a></em>, the innovations it came up with, and the fact that people might try to rip it or other successful comics off. Just guess what the last panels tended to be.</li><li> The last set of dailies consisted of Andy and Roger discussing what would happen if a cartoonist stopped doing dailies, asking how he would thank his fans, etc. This trope even gets <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a></em> at one point when Roger suggests that the cartoonist would straight-up thank his fans for their support, and Andy responds, "And break the fourth wall? Not likely."</li><li> In another arc, Andy was having trouble motivating herself to write her column. In the last strip of the arc, she finally finishes at around midnight, and Roger muses about what might happen if a cartoonist just didn't feel like drawing. Cue the lights turning off.</li><li> In the aforementioned cookie-nightmare arc, Peter points out that he has it on authority that they'll be back to normal in the next strip. He calls it a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">doughus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">ex machina</a>."</li><li> The 'ink outage' arc shatters the fourth wall, jumping all the way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">Medium Awareness</a> (see below).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a>: Jason, to the point where he appears in nearly every strip to deliver the punchline.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriarPatching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BriarPatching">Briar Patching</a>: Jason tries this after accidentally crashing the family car, but makes the mistake of listing a punishment he would not like (losing computer time), as a lenient one.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenTreasure">Broken Treasure</a>: In one early story arc, Quincy chewed up Paige's favorite sweater and Jason (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">actually feeling guilty</a>) tried to repair it, but when he got found out he ended up buying a replacement...except that it was a Spider-Man sweater, which he thought she'd like better.<ul><li> In a later arc, Paige gets an autographed photograph from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">Backsync</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Boys</a>, but once again Quincy eats it while she's at school. Since Andy promised to watch it, Paige blames her and spends the next few days slinging guilt (calling Andy "mother who ruined my life" and such) to get whatever she wants.

In another strip, he takes advantage of the all you can eat special at the pizza place where his friend Steve works at, and eats for six hours straight, only stopping when Steve tells him to leave at midnight (seeing as the special has ended, and his manager is <em>pissed</em>. Peter pushes his luck further and asks if he can have some to go.).

Paige also once attempts this by mixing coffee and tea together at Peter's suggestion so she can finish a book for English, but it ends badly as she overdoes it (shocking even Peter with how much she drinks) and is so jittery as a result that she is unable to sit still long enough to read.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a>:<ul><li> The first vacation arc began Roger excitedly asking the family where they are going, and them unenthusiastically responding that it's Uncle Ralph's cabin, where they've gone camping at for the past 10 years. When Roger asks how they knew, one of them says, "Dad, you're blocking the TV." A year later, a gag repeats the first three panels word-for-word, but the fourth panel has the dad shouting "HAWAII!" and one of the kids saying "Dad, you're blocking the T&#151;<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWhat">WHAT?!?</a>"</li><li> One early strip has Paige finding her old teddy bear "Grizzly Pooh" in the attic and remembering how she used to use it to harass Jason (the implication being that this is the reason he harasses <em>her</em> nowadays). Almost two decades later, we get a strip where Paige pulls Grizzly Pooh out of the attic again, once more realizing that she put him away because of Jason (though this time it's due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">G.I.

Midway through, she realizes that it's a dream, and concludes that she'll wake up before hitting the ground. Sure, enough, she does. The last panel has her realizing she was right... as she falls out of bed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catch22Dilemma">Catch-22 Dilemma</a>: A strip where Jason asks Roger if he can hang out with his friend Marcus, and Roger answers "I'm okay with it if your mom is." Then when Jason asks Andy, she says "I'm okay with it if your father is." The comic ends with Jason reading a book on formal logic, trying to figure out whether they actually gave him permission or not. The next comic had Paige asking a similar question and getting the same answers... and she simply interprets that as an okay.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelebrityParadox">Celebrity Paradox</a>: It's not uncommon for an out-of-universe comic strip character to be spoken of by the Foxes as though they were a fictional character only to make a cameo (often as part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverPunchline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverPunchline">Crossover Punchline</a>) in another strip.

But later on? He <em>loves</em> school.<ul><li> One early storyline sees him try to impress Roger and Peter by memorizing sports trivia. By the mid-1990s, he considers anything of the sort beneath him.</li></ul></li><li> Early on, Roger was shown as being <em>good</em> at chess and wasn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">Too Dumb to Live</a>.

About a year later, with no explanation given but ostensibly because it got old for her, she's suddenly sick of Jason's antics (though it's she still doesn't flip out the way Miss Grinchley supposedly did).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateFrostedSugarBombs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateFrostedSugarBombs">Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs</a>: This Trope is used often, usually to contrast against Andy's own health-craziness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>:<ul><li> During one shopping trip, Andy asked Jason to pick out one cereal whose first ingredient wasn't sugar.

Flakes."</li><li> Another has Jason admitting that while his "Sugar-Frosted Honey Flakes" are gross enough to turn his milk into purple ooze, he'll still eat six bowls every morning to get a glow-in-the-dark dinosaur stickers offer. Paige, reading the ingredients, remarks, "Actually, I'm a little surprised you don't glow in the dark by now." The choice of the color purple is likely a direct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a></em>, in which Calvin once said, "I won't eat any cereal that doesn't turn the milk purple.")</li><li> In another series of strips, Jason's cereal <em>itself</em> glowed in the dark, and when Peter ate it (because they were out of Wheaties) it made him sick. At first he was surprised that one bowl of cereal made him so sick; then he read the ingredients, and was glad it <em>only</em> made him that sick.</li><li> In yet ANOTHER strip, the kids have nothing but a bowls of sugar for breakfast and claim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">it STILL doesn't have as much sugar as most cereals.</a></li><li> In the throwaway panels of one Easter Sunday strip, Paige is wondering what to take from her candy basket first.

One Halloween comic in the 80s had Roger attempt to impersonate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Darth Vader</a>, and he mispronounces "Obi-Wan Kenobi" and does the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Vulcan salute</a>.

Heck, when I was a kid, 19<strong>80</strong> was this year way off in the future!" (The joke being that all of the monologue is coming from off-panel until the last panel, when it's revealed that it's Peter talking, not Roger.) Of course, twenty years have passed since that strip was published...</li><li> It was played with in a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/foxtrot/2008/04/06">strip<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> about the comic's twentieth anniversary where Jason complains that Paige stole his hairpiece again.</li><li> An odd example happens in an arc where Roger decides to do the Christmas cards himself to surprise Andy. In one strip he finds and prints out a Christmas letter he found on the computer, the gag being that it's hilariously outdated ("Peter stopped using diapers this year..."). However, the fact that it's on the computer suggests that they've had one since Peter was at least a toddler, while this particular strip was printed in the early 2000s, which would date the old letter to the mid 1980s.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyOffTopicReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyOffTopicReport">Completely Off-Topic Report</a>: Jason once had to do an oral presentation on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldYeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldYeller">Old Yeller</a></em>.

When Andy finds one with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid1989">Ariel</a> on it, Paige is practically openly suggesting she get it for Jason, although Andy seemed to know better, causing Paige to curse that she's no fun. It's not made clear as to whether Paige wanted the backpack for herself or whether she did genuinely intend to give Jason the backpack, although solely to humilate him, but what is made clear is that it wouldn't have benefitted or fit Jason in either case.</li><li> Something similar happened in another strip where Paige went Christmas shopping for various clothing that supposedly were her family, although they were actually intended to be for herself (for one thing, all the items that they have in common are that they are girls' items, and one of the shoes, Andy notes, matches Paige's shoe size).</li><li> Roger once gave Jason Four Solid Metal Gears and a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WalkTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WalkTheLine">Walk the Line</a></em> CD in previous Christmases, apparently because Roger did not understand what Jason meant by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4GunsOfThePatriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">or even "Cash"</a>.</li><li> Another rather unpleasant example was when Andy went back-to-school shopping and bought Jason stuff with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyAndFriends">Barney &amp; Friends</a></em> pictures on them, believing he'd like them because he liked dinosaurs.

Unfortunately, Andy herself has "issues" with her due to feeling inadequate when she's around; her worst case of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">Lethal Chef</a> came from trying to outdo her on Thanksgving.

He once tried to form a one-man corporation, but all he had to show investors was "a dinky little program I wrote for fun."

If the thought ever occurs to him to make money off of the things he produces, it's only so he can buy materials needed to cause greater mischief.

He once tried to run a yellow light from five blocks away. Another time, his driving created a zero-G effect in the car. When Jason plays the video game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Carmageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Carmageddon">Carmageddon</a></em> it gives both him <em>and</em> Paige the feeling they've been in the actual car.

As the 1990s progressed, pretty much everyone's personalities got exaggerated into cartoonish caricatures, while "nerd" humor (though present in small doses from the earliest years) and pop-culture references began to dominate even the most basic of interactions. Some of the defining personality traits &mdash; such as Roger's and Paige's incompetence at cooking, Peter's huge appetite and incompetence in sports &mdash; aren't even present in the earlier strips at all.<ul><li> One could be forgiven for thinking that the strips pre-1992 or so were part of a different comic, as the character designs and the tone are so dissimilar to what they became.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a>: Zig-zagged at the end of one arc in which Jason unwittingly gets Eileen's hopes up by giving her the impression that he's interested in her.

In another, he locks all the food in the car, and spends the whole arc trying to open it with a clothes hangar.</li><li> Subverted once when the family's next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleCampingTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleCampingTrip">Horrible Camping Trip</a> was instead a trip to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouvenirLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouvenirLand">Fun-Fun Mountain</a> (Although the parents weren't too happy).</li><li> And subverted again in an early arc where they go to Hawaii.</li><li> Zig-zagged in the Caribbean resort arc, as most of the family enjoyed it even though the place turned out to be every possible kind of fake and cheap: It was actually housed in a giant building with an artificial beach hundreds of miles from any ocean, the staff all had fake Jamaican accents, the "steel drums" were a synthesizer (whose player accidentally hits the button for bagpipes instead), and the "limbo suite" is so named because of its low ceiling. (Roger had taken the "How low can you go" sales pitch to mean it was a low rate.) Andy was the only one dissatisfied with the trip.</li><li> Roger turns out to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a>, as revealed in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/foxtrot/2002/08/17">this strip<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowTheCharacterStoleChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowTheCharacterStoleChristmas">How the Character Stole Christmas</a>: Jason wrote a pastiche of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas">How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</a></em> with his mom as the title character.

When she learns that Peter punched the guy for insulting her, she says "And you <strong>just</strong> punched him in the nose?!" and Peter, rolling his eyes, responds "Look, Clint, I..."</li><li> Roger is like this in a very early Sunday strip. He wakes the kids up for church, and they're upset, wanting to go back to sleep. Roger scolds them, telling them, "Someday you'll realize that some things are more important than sleep!" What does he do when they get to church? He falls asleep.</li><li> In another strip, Paige chides Peter for hanging a wall calendar in his room filled with photos of half-naked (or more) women.<div class="indent"><strong>Paige:</strong> Need I remind you that Mom and I <em>do</em> come into this room on occasion? Did you ever think of that, Mr. Insensitive? I mean, you could have gotten one with at least a <em>couple</em> of half-naked men. <br><strong>Peter:</strong> What?! Every time you see <em>me</em> in my skivvies you just laugh.</div></li><li> In one series of strips Paige gets a pimple on the end of her nose and freaks out about it. Andy tells her that it's just a natural part of growing up and she needs to calm down...and then when Paige asks "Is that a new gray hair?" she freaks out just as bad, prompting Paige to walk off saying "No comment."</li><li> In one series of strips Peter goes to the pizzaria where his best friend Steve works, figuring that he'll be able to get free pizza.

It turned out to be Roger who's holding a literal bulb up because he wants to impress her with all his Edison knowledge.</li><li> Another strip has Paige, who is struggling with her homework, hold a lightbulb over her head in order to invoke this trope.

He professes to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a> (even <em>desiring</em> the "insufferable" part), but several times he proves to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a> armed with a vast library of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleKnownFacts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleKnownFacts">Little Known Facts</a> that he uses to try to impress people, only to look foolish. Some examples include doing a multimedia computer presentation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldYeller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldYeller">Old Yeller</a></em> as a book report that had nothing whatsoever to do with the book (which he never even read) and doing a class report on Amazon.com when the assignment was the Amazon river. (His excuse? "I looked it up, they don't have one.") There are dozens more, all of them incredibly silly. That said, Jason is very book smart, tutors Paige on math and generally gets straight As, but it could be argued he is Street Stupid. Eileen acts as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foil</a>, being both just as book smart at him but more streetwise</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllTakeTwoBeersToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllTakeTwoBeersToo">I'll Take Two Beers Too</a>: Peter and Denise at a fast food restaurant.

Paige apparently has superhuman hearing with regard to this, as in one strip Peter, while at home (and after being reassured by Andy that Paige wasn't), told Andy he was going to the mall and Paige apparently heard it although she was standing in the popcorn line at the movies at the time.<ul><li> The same gag applies to Jason with regard to computer shopping (in the story arc in which the iFruit is introduced).</li><li> Another example involving Paige occurs in an early strip in which Jason is being scolded by Andy for not buying Valentine cards for his class as he was supposed to, because the store only had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MuppetBabies">Muppet Babies</a> cards.<div class="indent"><strong>Andy:</strong> What's wrong with Muppet Baby cards? <br><strong>Jason:</strong> Mother, do you know what kind of <em>loser</em> buys Muppet Baby cards?! <br><strong>Paige:</strong> <em>[entering]</em> I can't believe I just got the last box of Muppet Baby cards! <br><strong>Andy:</strong> Bad timing, Paige. <br><strong>Jason:</strong> I rest my case.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent">Incendiary Exponent</a>: Basically any time Roger (and in some cases, Peter) attempts to light the grill for a barbecue.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a>: Jason and Peter are supposed to be skinny, and Roger is supposed to be overweight, but all three appear to be roughly the same build as all the other characters. (It's slightly more noticeable when their shirts are off. Some of it could be chalked up to Peter's baggy sweatshirt.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentSwearing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentSwearing">Innocent Swearing</a>: In one episode, Paige watches <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJerrySpringerShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheJerrySpringerShow">Jerzy Spaniel</a></em> while babysitting. Of course, the kid hears the word and starts repeating it. In the epilogue, Paige reports that the mother said kids always hear bad words and repeat them, but if you don't use them often or attach special significance to them, they'll eventually drop it. <em>Then</em> they discussed watching <em>Jerzy Spaniel</em> while babysitting... resulting in Paige making a grand total of <em>one cent</em> for that babysitting job.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAIJustAddWater">Instant A.I.: Just Add Water!</a>:<ul><li> The iFruit can speak, fantasize about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TombRaider">sexy video game characters</a>, demand hugs, and taunt those who refuse to play games against it. It also has, at times, a rather disturbing ability to deny user control and even control its own environment, changing not only its own wallpaper, but the wallpaper <em>in the computer room</em>.</li><li> One comic also featured a digital camera that supposedly had some sort of AI to guarantee decent pictures. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane">Roger</a> tried to use it, it asked to be handed to someone who knows what he's doing, and retracted all the buttons.</li><li> Various other talking, seemingly intelligent electronic devices: A electronic chess set in the early days, an obnoxious computer at Roger's workplace ("Can I get you some coffee? ...Oh wait, I don't have arms."), and a Tamagrouchy, a sentient (and aptly-named) knockoff of a Tamagotchi that Roger got Paige for cheap at the height of the real thing's popularity.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">Insufferable Genius</a>: Eugene Wu, mostly because he's an arrogant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who feels the need to rub his intelligence in everyone's faces.

Peter then tries to tell the order-taker that he was only there to get a cheeseburger, to which the order taker reopens the channel and apologizes, explaining that it's been a rough week.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover">Intercontinuity Crossover</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example: One strip had a TV Christmas special playing called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RudolphTheRedNosedReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RudolphTheRedNosedReindeer">Rudolph's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a> Christmas" where, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">just as the title implied</a>, has Hermie, Rudolph, and Clarence being dispatched by the Elf enforcer to Rivendell to meet up with Elrond for a council (presumably the same one Elrond held regarding the One Ring).

He never learns, apparently. Without a doubt, his worst attempt was the time he tried to use the computer to do them; a bad idea for someone who has a hard time simply figuring out how to use a mouse.</li><li> He actually tried it <em>twice</em>. To be fair, the first time <em>would</em> have worked... had Jason not deleted the file (due to its size) to make space for a Moon Rover simulator. He didn't <em>know</em> that the file was related to taxes, but randomly deleting files doesn't make it that much better.</li><li> A different variation of this occurred in a Sunday strip depicting Jason and Marcus trick-or-treating. Despite not wearing any obvious costumes, everyone at the door reacts with horror. It then cuts to a frontal shot, depicting the boys wearing T-shirts reading "IRS Auditor". Marcus admits he was skeptical when Jason's dad suggested the costumes, while Jason hopes that one neighbour was only faking the heart attack.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents">Invisible Parents</a>: Denise's parents, who only appear in one arc and never on-screen.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IProduct">iProduct</a>: The iFruit, of course.

Nicole eventually gets asked out and Paige becomes upset and starts guilt-tripping her, essentially because it meant she wouldn't have someone to share her dateless misery with. After being called out on her attitude by Andy, Paige realizes she was being selfish and mends fences with Nicole...but they still argue about what color dress she's going to wear (to which Andy responds "Good friendships take time").</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPopularNowItSucks">It's Popular, Now It Sucks!</a>:<ul><li> In-universe example.

Although he is only concerned that enjoying Tolkien's trilogy will make it (gasp!) mainstream to be a nerd, therefore depriving people like himself of their "special" status.</li><li> Also, a very early story arc had him upset when his mom bought him a Batman lunchbox from the 1989 film, because the movie had already been out for a few months and he didn't want to be seen as a bandwagon-jumper.</li><li> In a <em>very</em> early week-long arc, Jason was obsessed about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>, but in the last strip, thought that "the fad was pass&eacute;" because Paige liked it.

He showed his brother his game, "Here's the observatory and here's the library..." and Peter said, "Wait, these are all the same levels of the first game. What makes this different?"

Of course, he tried to make moves on her, despite saying no, and he only relented after she threatened to mace him (which Paige only brought because Peter made her). After telling Peter what happened, his only response is that he's going to spend weeks taunting her and saying "I told you so," which only made her night worse.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a>:<ul><li> Jason, throughout the comic strips regular storylines, could be downright unlikeable.</li><li> Every member of the family has their moments, actually, with Paige and Andy also being downright nasty a few times.

Over time the series has switched to a more simple gag-a-day format (even before it became Sunday only) and comics with heavier themes are typically saved for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AVerySpecialEpisode">Very Special Episodes</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickAndLoadMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LipstickAndLoadMontage">Lipstick-and-Load Montage</a>: Done in a Sunday strip that apparently shows Paige putting on her make-up getting ready to go out.

Nicole seems to have somewhat better luck with boys than Paige does, but not much.<ul><li> On the rare occasions someone other than Morton Goldthwait seems to take an active interest in Paige, he often turns out to be a creep, like Chris Hennessey, Paige's upperclassman prom date whose attempts to seduce her ended when she threatened to mace him; or Mitch Kellogg, who propositioned Paige for sex at a party while drunk (she angrily refused).</li><li> There was one story arc in which Paige did go to a school dance with a reasonably nice, good-looking boy who seemed to like her too, but he was never heard from again afterward.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a>: The kids try this all the time:<ul><li> Peter combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutASliceTakeTheRest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutASliceTakeTheRest">Cut a Slice, Take the Rest</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Exact Words</a> in one strip. He tells Andy that he and Jason only had "one slice each" at the pizza parlor before dinner, which translated to one pizza cut in half (coincidentally, on a night when Andy happened to be making "curry loaf" for dinner). Afterwards, Peter tells Jason "The Book of Peter, verse 1: Know thy loopholes."</li><li> Paige does a similar one: her mother says she can only have one scoop of ice cream before dinner, so she jams a spoon into the ice cream tub and pulls out its entire contents as a single cylindrical "scoop."<div class="indent"><strong>Paige:</strong> One scoop.

After his mother agrees, he is shown with an Xbox and explaining to his friend Steve that he'll claim he actually asked "Would it be alright if I buy an Xbox with the money I saved for college?" but the signal on his crappy phone dropped out partway through. That way, his mother will also buy him a new cellphone.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotsOfLuggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotsOfLuggage">Lots of Luggage</a>: In one strip, Roger laughs at the amount of gear Jason and Peter are bringing on the trip, saying that if they brought much more there wouldn't be room for <em>them</em> in the car. Obvious to the reader is the fact that that's exactly what they're trying to achieve (Fox family camping trips <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleCampingTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleCampingTrip">never end well</a>), and in fact most of their luggage is filled with styrofoam.<div class="indent"><strong>Peter:</strong> Out of curiosity, <em>how</em> much more? <br><strong>Jason:</strong> I'm running low on duffel bags.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudOfWar">Loud of War</a>: In one strip, Paige is annoyed at the sounds of Jason making sweet talk to Quincy in the next room, and eventually yells at him.

"You're kissing my pillow.") At the point where Roger is planting one on Andy's elbow, she suggests they keep a pot of coffee in the bedroom.</li><li> Peter seems to get this from his father, although it usually only kicks in during cram sessions. One strip taking place during midterm season has Peter reading off the entire menu of a coffeehouse as his order. Another one has him drinking Starbucks on the way home, and after his mom protests, he says that he's drinking lesser amounts to wean himself off the large amounts he took during test season to prevent a crash. When she asks if that means he's drinking half-caff, he reveals that it's actually a quintuple expresso.<ul><li> In one story arc, Paige, who needs to pull an all-nighter to finish reading a book for English class, asks Peter whether coffee or tea has more caffeine, and Peter suggests she <em>combine</em> both into one concoction. She overdoes it by drinking a <em>dozen</em> cups of the stuff - even Peter, the caffeine king, is shocked when he finds out how much Paige drank - and is so jittery as a result that she's unable to keep still in order to read, or to sleep once she gives up on reading because of her jitters.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends">Must Make Amends</a>: After Jason falls off the roof while trying to get the football, Peter offers to stay with him at the hospital as a means of atoning for causing this.

In one arc, Paige actually attends a Halloween party held by Morton, because she doesn't want to be rude. In an earlier arc, Paige actually <em>defended</em> Morton when Peter called him a "drip", even going so far as to kick Peter in the shin for his rude comment. To be fair, this was after Morton gave Paige a heartfelt "thank you" for just letting him sit by her at lunch, since most girls won't even let him near, and Paige was visibly moved. And in a third, Paige is actually <em>upset</em> when Morton asks someone other than her to the Christmas dance, although this turns out to not be such an out-of-character moment as the reason Paige was upset was that her ego was bruised.</li><li> Also, in another arc (conveniently one of the last daily strip arcs), Jason was apparently falling behind his studies because of his playing video games. The fact that he even has to take finals is itself out of character as Jason is actually more likely to not have any finals (usually taking them way back in September). Never mind the fact that he's usually portrayed as being so smart that he doesn't need to study.</li><li> Jason downloading a swimsuit calendar and happily noting how big Miss October's "hooters" are.

When Paige tried to do just that, she ended up slapping him in the face, and Andy informed her that she was now grounded for hitting her brother.</li><li> It happens to Jason himself when he bets Marcus fifty cents that he can write a longer essay. His thousand page essay easily trumps Marcus' 500-page one, but while Marcus gets an A on the essay, Jason, for all his work, gets a D, and fifty cents.

She doesn't take it well.</li><li> Another in-universe example is where Roger returns from the store and buys hygeine products for his family. He gives Paige a huge container of pimple cream (he went to a warehouse club to get them), causing Paige to react with emotional distress at the unintended implication that she was extremely prone to breaking out with acne, causing Andy to inform him never to buy hygene products from the club ever again. He didn't take the clue, as he also gives her anti-graying formula that's of a similar size, although we never see Andy's reaction. It's actually easier to list the in-universe ones than the YMMV ones in this strip.</li><li> Also, Roger mentions to Peter that he loves spring weather and reminisces that he and his friends often went in the noontime to relax near the lake.

Eventually, he did get the tickets, and speculated that the reason for the insanely long amount of time it took to download the tickets was because the theater's server was swamped. Jason was right, but not in the way he would have thought, as it immediately cut to the sink with a computer server in the sink with running water, with the head of the theater shouting to Johnson "I told you to wash the <strong>butter</strong> server!", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">thus meaning that the server was literally "swamped."</a></li><li> Another Johnson (or possibly the same one) was responsible for disconnecting Jason from the WOW server <em>just</em> before he could claim an ultra-rare item by tripping on a cable.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchOutForThatTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatchOutForThatTree">Watch Out for That Tree!</a>: "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/foxtrot/1998/07/08">We need to find softer trees.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>"</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterHoseRodeo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterHoseRodeo">Water Hose Rodeo</a>: Jason says "One day I'm going to put on weight and really enjoy watering the lawn" after one such rodeo.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightWoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeightWoe">Weight Woe</a>: Despite her penchant for junk food, Paige was shown to be occasionally weight-conscious in early strips.

The same college's iconic chapel frequently appears in the background during Roger's college reunions, leading to a nice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a>.</li><li> Several hints dropped seem to indicate they live in the Chicago area, such as Andy going to, and returning from, a Chicago Bulls game in the same night.

An example is one strip where Jason states that "the [Comic-Con] in San Diego is too far away" but a strip the next year has him getting ready to go to Comic-Con as though he lives there.</li><li> In one strip, Jason celebrates the new year at 8 am, remarking that's "it's midnight in New Guinea". This would place the Fox family in the Mountain Time Zone.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood">Whip It Good</a>: Peter and Jason wield whips (with varying degrees of success) while emulating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones">Young Indiana Jones</a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst">Who's on First?</a>: Jason and Marcus do one relating to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas">How the Grinch Stole Christmas!</a></em>, complete with a reference to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a>:<div class="indent"><strong>Marcus:</strong> Who are they? <br><strong>Jason:</strong> Yes. <br><strong>Marcus:</strong> I mean the people. <br><strong>Jason:</strong> Who. <br><strong>Marcus:</strong> The ones standing in a circle singing that "Fahoo" song! <br><strong>Jason:</strong> They're Who. <br><strong>Marcus:</strong> What are you asking <em>me</em> for?! <br><strong>Jason:</strong> Abbott and Costello meet the Grinch. <br><strong>Paige:</strong> Who?</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldBeStupidEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldBeStupidEnough">Who Would Be Stupid Enough?</a>: Jason asked every member of his family if they wanted to have a snowball fight with him. They each reply "Do I look like an idiot?"... until he gets to Roger, who says "Let me get my coat" before Jason can even finish the question.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">Wild Teen Party</a>: In a 1989 story arc, Paige and Nicole get invited to one at the home of Mitch Kellogg, an upperclassman, and quickly discover it's not what they expected. Everyone is drinking and doing drugs, and a drunken Mitch even propositions Paige for sex and then attempts to get her to smoke pot and do coke with him. Paige refuses each time, and when Mitch still won't leave her alone, resorts to punching him the face, remarking to herself, "Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrugsAreBad">just saying no</a> isn't enough." Perhaps to illustrate how strung out Mitch is, he is unfazed by Paige's punch and merely moves on to another girl.<ul><li> In the final strip of the arc, Paige complains about how much the party sucks, and Nicole remarks that at least it's better than sitting home watching a rental movie. This remark is followed by an off-screen beer chugging contest followed by everyone puking in unison. Paige and Nicole high-tail it out of there and head for the video store.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WilliamTelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WilliamTelling">William Telling</a>:<ul><li> Roger asks Jason what sport he has taken up and Jason tells him to put an apple on his head and he'll demonstrate. Roger, wisely, flees.</li><li> Inverted in one strip where Jason has an arrow tied to his head, and Marcus tries to shoot apples through a bow at it. He says that way, they're only being kinda stupid.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WomenAreWiser">Women Are Wiser</a>: Andy, although she's frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">Not So Above It All</a>. In fact, this eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderized">Flanderized</a> to the point where she's just about as insane as the rest of the family and only <em>thinks</em> she's the sensible one. (And very much averted with Paige.)</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WontTakeYesForAnAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WontTakeYesForAnAnswer">Won't Take "Yes" for an Answer</a>:<ul><li> Peter's first attempt to ask Denise out.</li><li> Also occurs in a 1990 strip where, even after Peter places an ad in the school paper, Paige is unable to find a date for her or Nicole. A set of twins finally says yes to both of them, but Paige rescinds their offer even <em>after</em> spending most of the past two weeks' worth of strips complaining about her inability to find a date. Apparently, this resistance was either because they insist on having someone ask <em>them</em> out instead of the other way around or because the twins were totally dorky (we never actually see them, but their response to being asked out was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoshDangItToHeck">Golly, gosh dang, gee whiz</a>, <strong>yes!</strong>").</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstNewsJudgmentEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorstNewsJudgmentEver">Worst News Judgment Ever</a>: Andy is watching the OJ Simpson trials. Suddenly, breaking news: aliens have landed and are now addressing the UN! Amazing! Now back to the OJ Simpson trials.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlockMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlockMontage">Writer's Block Montage</a>: Occurs with Roger in the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HerCodeNameWasMarySue">Her Code Name Was "Mary Sue"</a> story arc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingLines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingLines">Writing Lines</a>: Jason has been subjected to this on a regular basis, to the point of doing them a day in advance so he wouldn't have to miss a doctor's appointment by staying late.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenRoar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenRoar">Written Roar</a>:<ul><li> "AAAA!" is the preferred method of screaming in this strip.</li><li> Likewise, "WAAAA!" (sometimes with a ~ at the end) is the preferred method of crying/sobbing in this strip.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenSoundEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenSoundEffect">Written Sound Effect</a>: "Pbbspt!" is Amend's favorite onomatopoeia for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake">Spit Takes</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">Wrong Genre Savvy</a>: Jason seems to believe that the laws of fantasy apply to reality more often than not, but relying on them usually only get him in trouble or gets him hurt (or both). For example, when he tries to imitate Spider-Man and builds a web-shooter, he wonders why he only succeeds in getting himself tangled in it.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction">Xenofiction</a>: A few strips are from Quincy's (Jason's pet iguana) point of view. In one we're given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PovCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PovCam">P.O.V. Cam</a> view while he's inside his hamster ball. In another, we're taken inside a dream of his where he's the size of a T-Rex and terrorizing people in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a>: One 1990 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> has Roger getting a summer intern named Skip Riley who completely sucks up to him. While this thrills Roger, it saddens Peter, who feels that Roger is pushing him aside in favor of Skip (one strip has him gushing about Skip to Andy and completely ignoring Peter's request to come out and play catch). At the end, Roger has a meeting with a higher-up, causing Skip to ditch Roger entirely and start sucking up to him instead, in order to work <em>his</em> way up the ladder.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YetAnotherChristmasCarol">Yet Another Christmas Carol</a>: A two-week storyline has Jason having a dream involving the cast as the characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChristmasCarol">A Christmas Carol</a></em> (thanks to Andy's garlic, green pepper and tofu chili, 'the meal of a thousand nightmares'). Paige is Christmas Past, and shows him how happy she was before he came along; Peter was Christmas Present and, after making the standard "Present/Presents" mistake, eats the mountain of food; Quincy is Christmas Yet To Come, and shows Jason his grave (which freaks him out, since he died the day before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> came out.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreGrounded">You Are Grounded</a>: Happens several times to Peter. In fact, in one series, Andy grounded him for seeing <em>Kill Bill 2</em>, then grounded him for another week after figuring out he saw the first <em>Kill Bill</em> movie the year before. Andy eventually released Peter from being grounded, although only because trying to ground him for two weeks actually proved to be cruel and unusual torture for the rest of the family.<ul><li> In another story arc a few years earlier, Andy grounds Paige for seeing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndecentProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndecentProposal">Indecent Proposal</a></em>. In this instance, however, Paige is only grounded for one weekend (which is more than enough for Paige since it means she'll have to endure Jason all weekend).</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDONOTWantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDONOTWantToKnow">You Do NOT Want to Know</a>: This is Roger's answer when Andy asks just how zoned out she was with her allergy medication's side effects. It's also shown to send her into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">Mushroom Samba</a> (one of the kids offscreen asks Andy if she could take the Pink Floyd out of the music player, and Andy wonders who wrote squiggly lines on her hand).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMakeMeSic">You Make Me Sic</a>:<ul><li> Done frequently by Andy. She tries to justify it by being an English major who appreciates the value of the language, but judging from Peter's response of "You're coming through real clear", it doesn't work.</li><li> Roger, of all people, chews out a co-worker for turning in a typo-filled paper. Said co-worker blames it on his computer's lack of a spell checker. (Worth mentioning is that this isn't Roger complaining about a few misspelled words- the co-worker had the spelling skills of a three year old. Even the simplest words are mangled, the punchline being that computerized spellchecking was so commonplace that the co-worker believed the lack of it was a perfectly acceptable excuse for the abysmal quality.)</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom">Your Mom</a>: In one strip, Jason and Marcus exchange "your momma" lines as a means of trash-talking before a test. This exchange led to the title of one of the compilations, <em>Your Momma Thinks Square Roots Are Vegetables</em>.</li></ul></div><p></p><hr>
