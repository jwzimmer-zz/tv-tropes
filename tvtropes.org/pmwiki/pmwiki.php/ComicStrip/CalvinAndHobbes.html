It came at a time when the comics medium needed it the most; almost everyone before Watterson attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FollowTheLeader">copy the success</a> of <em>Peanuts</em> by imitating the deceptively simple style and focusing on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">funny animals</a> like Snoopy that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CashCowFranchise">bring in the money</a>. Unfortunately, comic creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody">missed the mark on the aspects of Schulz's strip that actually should have been followed</a>, mainly the philosophical themes and the down-to-earthiness. As a result, comics once again became gag-a-day strips rather than an artistic medium, and there was a shift from children characters to teenagers and adults.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Watterson reminded us that newspaper comics don't have to be bland, crude drawings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">funny animals</a> can have deeper personalities and insights in life, and that it <em>was</em> still possible for a strip to successfully explore philosophical themes without feeling tacked on. And yes, comics about children can still be great. It was so successful that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMSchulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesMSchulz">Charles M. Schulz</a> gave his approval in a foreword to one of the book collections.</p><p>Calvin is a precocious 6-year-old who lives in a slightly different, more exciting reality than everybody around him, full of alien visitors, dinosaurs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockYuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockYuck">parental cooking</a> so awful that occasionally <em>it</em> tries to eat <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RussianReversal">him</a></em>. Hobbes is his best friend; to Calvin, he's a walking, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingAnimal">talking</a> tiger. Surprisingly, to everyone else he's not only an inanimate plush toy, but looks different when he's immobile than he does when he's alive, despite the fact that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> there are lifelike stuffed animals that look nothing like their real counterpart.</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>As if Calvin's life wasn't exciting enough, he also often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrImagination">imagines</a> himself to be someone more glamorous, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera">sci-fi adventurer</a> Spaceman Spiff, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmNoir">world-weary</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateDetective">private eye</a> Tracer Bullet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> Stupendous Man, or a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrannosaurusRex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></em>. Calvin's non-dinosaur-and-alien-related moments are often much more philosophical than a six-year-old generally appears, and Watterson directly acknowledges this in several anthologies and interviews. To Watterson, Calvin is a tool to subtly mock the modern age in its myriad forms &mdash; Calvin creates snowmen that resemble pretentious postmodern art sculptures, rails against the modern world's hyper-commercialized state while indulging in it like the worst six-year-old, and occasionally questions the justification for humanity's continuing existence while gazing at a piece of trash carelessly discarded in the woods. At the same time, Calvin perfectly portrays the realistic child genius- one moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">casually articulating concepts he won't cover in vocabulary tests until high school</a>, the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrattyHalfPint">throwing a temper tantrum because they're out of his favorite cereal</a>.</p><p>One of the most important (or perhaps that should be least important) parts of the strip is that the reality of Hobbes' dual nature and the many adventures and misadventures he and Calvin share is frequently left ambiguous. Watterson has described the matter as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchrodingersButterfly">being a non-question</a>: This is not a strip about a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> going on magical adventures with a stuffed animal that comes to life when no one else is looking, nor is it as simple as a boy with a stuffed tiger and an overactive imagination. This is a strip about the world seen through Calvin's eyes. To Calvin, Hobbes is a real tiger, a cardboard box is a cloning device, a wagon driven off a ramp can fly to Mars, and mutant snowmen can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">stage a rebellion against their creator</a>. And that is all that matters.</p><p>The strip was known for being fun to look at, due to Watterson's sheer artistic skill; for its ability to tell stories <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDialogueEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDialogueEpisode">without dialogue</a>; and for its varied and creative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SundayStrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SundayStrip">Sunday Strip</a> layout. This in itself was a major controversy, as Watterson requested a fixed amount of square footage for his Sundays (as opposed to funny-page standards, which requires the cartoonist to fit the story into six or eight pre-sized panels that can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication">cut apart, reassembled or discarded</a> as each individual newspaper sees fit.) Watterson argued that, since comic strips are a visual medium, it would be in everyone's best interests for him to have complete visual control over his work, regardless of resulting upheavals in comics-page layouts. He won, and similar fixed-layout concessions have gone out to comics such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/OverTheHedge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/OverTheHedge">Over the Hedge</a></em> in following years.</p><p>Watterson consistently refused to license his characters for products or media other than the various compilations of the strip and even had a brutal fight with his syndicate over it. Though he won, this led to a booming market in unofficial merchandise, one of the more ubiquitous being window stickers of Calvin urinating on the logos of various American car manufacturers. At one point in time he considered an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">animated TV series</a> featuring the characters, expressing a fondness for the medium, though this never came to fruition. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0efyi');"><sup>note&nbsp;</sup></span><span id="note0efyi" class="inlinefolder" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0efyi');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One of the main reasons being that by giving the characters voices, Watterson felt he would be robbing long-time readers of what the characters sounded like to them. Moreover, Watterson felt that by animating the series, he would have to sacrifice the satisfaction of the cartoon being created solely by him. This was part of the reason for his obstinate refusal to license; to him, approving someone else's work is not the same as doing it yourself.</span></p><p><em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> ran from November 18, 1985 to December 31, 1995, at which point Watterson retired for fear of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark">strip going stale</a>. No new material has been released since then and Watterson, who changed careers from cartooning to oil painting, has become a notorious media recluse in the intervening years. In early 2011, he mailed an oil painting of a character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CulDeSac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CulDeSac">Cul de Sac</a></em> to his syndicate as a donation for the Team Cul de Sac Parkinson's Research charity. This was the first piece of new art his syndicate had received from him in 16 years. Two years later, he produced a poster for the film <em>Stripped</em>, a documentary on the history of newspaper comics. A year after that, he collaborated with Stephen Pastis for three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine">Pearls Before Swine</a></em> strips (Pastis called this the cartoonist equivalent of getting "a glimpse of Bigfoot", and would later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">pay tribute</a> to the iconic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndTheAdventureContinues">final strip</a> of <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> in the strip the day after Watterson's contributions). In a 2015 interview, he pointed out that he's not really "reclusive", but when you're trying to keep <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan">complete strangers</a> from digging up your phone number and calling you, you have to build walls and maintain them.</p><p>A documentary on the comic, called <em><a class="urllink" href="http://tinyurl.com/m4qnlzu">Dear Mr. Watterson<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>, was released on Nov 13, 2013. It features interviews with cartoonists such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">Bill Amend</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine">Stephan Pastis</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty">Berkeley Breathed</a>. It explores the impact of <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>. The normally reclusive Watterson does a lengthy interview in the 2015 book <em>Exploring Calvin and Hobbes</em>. He also did an audio interview for the comic strip documentary <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.strippedfilm.com/">Stripped<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>.</p><p></p><hr><h2>Provides Examples of:</h2><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="toggleAllFolders();">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open/close all folders&nbsp; </div><p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-B&nbsp;</div><div id="folder0" class="folder" isfolder="true" style="display:block;"><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>: Watterson once wanted to run a whole month's worth of strips involving Calvin getting stuck on the ceiling due to his gravity polarity being reversed, and then growing larger and larger (to the point of the galaxy being the size of a hula-hoop, when proportionately compared) to see how the fans would react. Watterson feared the backlash and quickly pulled out, however. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1989/11/13">Here is the arc<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Being miserable builds character." In the final frame, his mother is laughing so hard she's fallen out of her chair, and whilst his father disapproves of what a sarcastic child they're raising, he reluctantly concedes "the voice was a little funny".</li><li> One time on school picture day, Calvin put shortening in his hair and with the help of Hobbes, got an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em> hairdo. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/02/26">Susie actually wishes she had thought of that.<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AddedAlliterativeAppeal">Added Alliterative Appeal</a>: Often found in the Spaceman Spiff and Stupendous Man storylines.<ul><li> <strong>Z</strong>orched by <strong>Z</strong>arches, <strong>S</strong>paceman <strong>S</strong>piff's <strong>c</strong>rippled <strong>c</strong>raft <strong>c</strong>rashes on <strong>P</strong>lanet <strong>P</strong>lootarg!</li><li> <strong>Z</strong>ounds!

Calvin, being six years old, is concerned only about Hobbes, and rushes into the house to find him. His parents, however, are notably shaken, and remain so for the rest of the arc. Calvin's dad in particular has to come to terms with the fact that being a parent doesn't automatically make you some invincible figure as he imagined his father was when he grew up. It's a question of hiding all those fears behind a brave face for the sake of one's family, which he learns to do.</li><li> There was also the time Calvin got lost on a trip to the zoo. His dad guessed correctly that he was still at the tiger pit, but wound up running all the way there when the (not wholly unreasonable) thought entered his head that Calvin might be trying to get <em>into</em> the tiger pit.</li><li> There's also a sense of this in the story where Calvin accidentally pushes the car into a ditch. He runs away, but when found is surprised to find his parents were more worried about what happened to him than about the car (which, luckily, wasn't damaged.)</li><li> For readers who are parents, pretty much any of Calvin's hijinks can be this. Just look at the number of wagon/toboggan rides that have ended up with Calvin ramping off a cliff.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">Adults Are Useless</a>: In the arc when Calvin joins the school baseball team, the coach gives Calvin no instruction, is rather abrasive, and doesn't object in the slightest when Calvin wants to quit.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerialCanyonChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerialCanyonChase">Aerial Canyon Chase</a>: One strip parodies this concept as Calvin imagining his mother as the alien battleship.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternatePersonalityPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternatePersonalityPunishment">Alternate Personality Punishment</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in one arc where Calvin time-travels two hours into the future in order to pick up his completed homework from his future self at 8:30. Naturally, 8:30 doesn't have it because he went to the future to get it two hours ago, so 6:30 and 8:30 decide it's 7:30 Calvin's fault. They both go to 7:30 to confront that time's Calvin, threatening to beat him up... but 7:30 points out that hitting him means 8:30 Calvin will get hurt too. In the end, they both return to 8:30 to find that 6:30 and 8:30 Hobbeses have done the homework for them (a novelization of the evening's events <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator">narrated by Hobbes</a>). Calvin says it made him the laughingstock of the class even if it did get him an A+.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeSelfNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeSelfNameChange">Alternative-Self Name-Change</a>: One arc had Calvin make several clones of himself.

Calvin frequently relies on Hobbes to get him through scary situations, including thinking there's a monster in his closet.</li><li> Consumerism won't make you happy. Calvin's dad, in particular, rails against the modern age quite frequently while riding on his bike.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles">Afraid of Needles</a>: When Calvin acts up at the doctor's office, it's usually because he wants to keep the doctor from giving him a shot. Although his behavior is way over the top, this is nonetheless realistic because many children Calvin's age are frightened of needles.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgainstMyReligion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgainstMyReligion">Against My Religion</a>: Calvin tries this when asked to <em>add two to seven</em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgelessBirthdayEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgelessBirthdayEpisode">Ageless Birthday Episode</a>: There was an arc where Susie invites Calvin to her birthday party.

Being exact copies of Calvin, they refused to do anything Calvin wouldn't do, like clean his room.

After falling again, he then wakes up for real, except by that point he's too scared to get out of bed.</li><li> There's also the Reality Within a Dream, where he's woken up by his mother and gets ready for school and actually GETS OUT THE DOOR before being woken up again.

The doctor calls one of them a cattle prod and says it will hurt a little less than a branding iron. Calvin faints upon hearing this and the doctor says that "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">little kids have no sense of humor</a>".</li><li> Calvin shows Hobbes an antelope...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded">an ant coming down the ladder into her boyfriend's car</a>. Hobbes tells him it isn't funny.</li><li> One one occasion where Rosalyn babysits, she jokes that she brought a cattle prod. His parents laugh but Calvin, not amused in the slightest, reacts by deciding to run away.

He doesn't think about where he's going to go after leaving Earth until Hobbes asks him, and one time when he time travels to pick up a school project when it was done, he forgets the little detail that since he didn't do it in the past, it was not done in the future. When he (and his 8:30 self) attempt to threaten his future (7:30) self to do the project, 7:30 Calvin points out something they forgot: since they were all the same person, the 6:30 (original time traveler) and 8:30 Calvins would have to suffer whatever they did to him. If the 6:30 and 8:30 Hobbeses hadn't decided to write the story on their own, he would have been in trouble. Hobbes, as in the above examples, serves as the voice of reason, but usually not in time to avoid getting pulled into insane antics.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedThankYouLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreadedThankYouLetter">The Dreaded Thank You Letter</a>: In one strip, Calvin writes a thank you letter for Christmas, but only because a woman sent a snarky message saying that she was checking to see if the mail was still working.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbDinos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbDinos">Dumb Dinos</a>: In the dinosaur strips, the carnivores are savage, violent monsters while the herbivores are dim, helpless victims.

The fantasies were more grotesque than fanciful, and one notorious 1986 strip even had references to terrorism and inhaling pesticide.</li><li> Calvin started out as a member of a Boy Scouts-esque organization, which was quietly dropped after Watterson had more trouble coming up with material for them than he thought he would. Then he realized Calvin would never have joined such a group in the first place.</li><li> Hobbes started out with pads on his hands. Watterson removed them later on the grounds that they were "visually distracting."</li><li> Though Calvin was always unusually precocious for a six-year-old, the first few years of the strip are quite a bit lighter on the philosophical moments than the rest of the comic, even in the occasional dramatic storyline such as Calvin losing Hobbes or the well-known injured raccoon story arc.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">On a more mundane note</a>, the very first strip is the only time Calvin refers to his father as "Pop" instead of "Dad".</li><li> One early strip had Susie trying to cheat off of Calvin on a test. Later strips would characterize her as a diligent student who would never do that (not to mention being smarter than to trust any answer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Calvin</a> came up with).</li><li> One strip implied the family owned two cars. Before kicking off another Rosalyn arc, Calvin thought his parents were going to leave him home alone while they went out for the evening. Calvin suggested to Hobbes that they "get in the other car and learn to drive." This "other car" is never seen or mentioned again in future strips and the little purple hatchback the family is usually in remains their sole vehicle.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a>:<ul><li> In one strip, Calvin steals a doll from Susie while playing G.R.O.S.S. with intent to hold it for ransom. In retaliation, she steals Hobbes. After Calvin apologizes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">pays up 25 cents for Hobbes's return</a>, he bombards Hobbes with demerits for not devouring Susie while he was captive. Hobbes claims he read Susie's diary.<div class="indent"><strong>Calvin:</strong> "You get 15 demerits for besmirching the club's reputation, plus 5 more for conduct unbecoming of an officer, and a censure in the club book for not devouring Susie when you had the chance. <br>... <br><strong>Hobbes:</strong> "I read an open page of Susie's diary, it said 'Calvin is a pig-faced smelly fat-head!'" <br><strong>Calvin:</strong> "Brilliant work Hobbes!

Calvin, feeling bad for hurting Susie's feelings with the same sort of offhand insult he'd toss casually with Hobbes, apologizes to her. Susie says that she forgives him, and Calvin sprints off, the weight of guilt lifted. Realizing that she suffered much more than he did, Susie is suddenly less inclined to be forgiving.<div class="indent"><strong>Susie:</strong> <strong>ON THE OTHER HAND, LET'S SEE YOU GROVEL A LITTLE!</strong></div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter Egg</a>: Watterson occasionally slips some into the comics; for example, on at least two occasions he altered his signature to fit an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtShift">Art Shift</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theheartofgold.org/jumpstation/facts.html">This page<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a> lists a few of them.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a>: The strip began in this era, as you can guess by the occasional nods to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>. It ran for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">a whole decade</a>, and you'll occasionally see references to contemporary technology and social issues. Calvin often expresses frustration with his parents being behind the times.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>: Some of those snowmen would be head trips if they weren't made of snow.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventyZillion">Eleventy Zillion</a>:<ul><li> When Calvin is having trouble with his homework, Hobbes tells him that the problem requires calculus and imaginary numbers, such as "eleventeen" and "thirty-twelve." (Imaginary numbers are a real mathematical concept, but this isn't how they work.) And just to put the cherry on top, the question is <em>eleven plus seven</em>.</li><li> In one strip, Calvin and Hobbes are discussing the value of nature and wildlife. When Hobbes suggests that "we need to start putting prices on the priceless," Calvin replies, "Yeah. If our woods are worth a zillion jillion bagillion, think what Alaska is worth."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyBroadcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmergencyBroadcast">Emergency Broadcast</a>: Calvin parodies one of these, with his attention signal being a loud, panel-filling scream.<div class="indent"> <strong>Calvin:</strong> Had this been a real emergency, the scream you just heard would have been followed by lots more just like it.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">Enemy Without</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subverted">Subverted</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Inverted">inverted</a>. In one arc, Calvin creates a duplicate of himself to do his chores, but the duplicate is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">too much like him</a> and refuses to help. Then it gets him in a bunch of trouble, not because it's more evil than him, but because it knows it can have fun and the original Calvin will get all the blame. In a later arc, Calvin manages to duplicate only the <em>good</em> side of his personality, who then masquerades as Calvin while the real article gets to slack off. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: "If you're Calvin's good side, you ought to be a lot smaller.") This goes better, until the good duplicate tries writing romantic poetry for Susie, to the original's horror. The good duplicate eventually gets so frustrated with the original that it stops being good and just self-destructs.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a>: Calvin, though nowhere near as evil as some others, is still a terror.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a>: Calvin's report on bats, which he thought was excellently and professionally worked on, turned out to be this. As a matter of fact, the story arc ends with this exchange:<div class="indent"> <strong>Hobbes:</strong> Do your parents know about your grade on it? <br><strong>Calvin:</strong> No, and if you'll grab a shovel and help me out, it'll stay that way.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>: When Rosalyn plays Calvinball with Calvin in her last appearance, she complains that the game makes no sense and it's like Calvin's just making it up as he goes. And then Calvin panics that she stumbled into the Perimeter of Wisdom, and it <em>all</em> falls into place.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneHasStandards">Everyone Has Standards</a>: Despite the rather minuscule nature of Calvin's good side, he never tries to actually hurt someone, and is always remorseful over any harm resulting.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryManHasHisPrice">Every Man Has His Price</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Discussed">Discussed</a> by the duo during one wagon ride.

Calvin realizes he's caught and gets ready to really take a bath.</li><li> Calvin thinks a bee landed on his back and asks Hobbes to check. Hobbes says "That's not a bee," and Calvin is relieved. Hobbes meant that the insect was actually a hornet; Calvin soon gets stung.</li><li> Calvin brags to Hobbes about his juggling skills, saying he can keep a dozen eggs in the air at once. He tosses the eggs up in the air; a second or so later, Calvin and the carpet are both covered in egg yolk and broken shells. Calvin says, "Notice I didn't say I could do it very long."</li><li> One of Calvin's attempts to thwart Hobbes' daily "Calvin is home from school" pounces involves yelling "I'M HOME!" <em>before</em> he opens the front door.<div class="indent"><strong>Calvin:</strong> <em>[as Hobbes holds his head in pain]</em> You'll notice I didn't say I was inside.</div></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>: When Calvin gets assigned to give a report on a newspaper article, he chooses: "Space alien weds two-headed Elvis clone."<div class="indent"><strong>Calvin:</strong> Actually, there's not much left to explain.</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcuseBoomerang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcuseBoomerang">Excuse Boomerang</a>: Similar to the Zeno of Citium story, Calvin claims that he can't be held accountable for his actions because he was fated to do them.

It gave us the wonderful Hobbes quote, "The only shade I see is from that bulldozer." Another gem is when Calvin asks how humans would feel if animals bulldozed the condos to put in new trees... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GilliganCut">cut</a> to Hobbes in the bulldozer, saying it's no good, as the driver didn't leave the keys.</li><li> Another famous line; while looking at a pile of garbage in the forest, Calvin sadly says: "Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us."</li><li> Another iconic strip involves the duo encountering litter in the middle of the woods. After Calvin rails about the pointlessness of this kind of waste, Hobbes quips, "Sometimes it's a matter of personal pride not to be human." After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">moment's thought</a>, Calving takes off his clothes, saying "I'm with you."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">Grey-and-Gray Morality</a>: Most nobody in the strip is completely good or bad. Calvin is a bratty child who enjoys ruining people's days. Hobbes, despite being Calvin's best friend, constantly torments him, says rude things just to annoy him, and makes snarky comments. On the other hand, most of Calvin's other antagonists, such as Susie, Rosalyn, and Miss Wormwood, are just reacting out of Calvin bothering them. The only character shown without any redeemable traits is Moe, not counting imaginary foes like the bike or the monsters under Calvin's bed.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrillingPyrotechnics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrillingPyrotechnics">Grilling Pyrotechnics</a>: Calvin once tried to talk his dad into invoking this.

In one strip, he gets sent to bed early just for firing two Nerf darts at her and in another, the <em>mere mention</em> of how he threatened to flush her science notes is enough to get him into trouble.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch">Halfway Plot Switch</a>: A few story arcs did this...<ul><li> The "Yukon Ho" story arc from 1987 started out with Calvin and Hobbes attempting to secede from the family and strike out for the Yukon. But a while into the journey they fight, and Calvin heads back for home leaving Hobbes on his own. Then when it gets dark, Calvin realizes Hobbes is still out there and sets out to find him, and the plot is now about trying to find Hobbes in the woods.</li><li> A spring 1989 story arc had Calvin and his parents go to a wedding, accidentally leaving Hobbes behind due to Calvin putting up a fuss about going, which Calvin keeps complaining about. When they return the next day, they find that their house was robbed, and the mood and plot suddenly changes, with the parents shaken up badly by the break-in, though once Calvin finds Hobbes (he was under the bed covers), he finds the whole robbery exciting... until he learns the television was stolen.</li><li> The story arc after <em>that</em> (and the longest in the strip's run) had Calvin and Hobbes setting up their secret club G.R.O.S.S., but then when they decide to use the garage for their clubhouse, an attempt to push Calvin's mom's car out accidentally sends it rolling into ditch, and then Calvin and Hobbes attempt to run away from home after what they did to avoid getting in trouble.</li><li> In a late 1989 story arc, Calvin is trying to do his homework when gravity reverses, causing him to get stuck on the ceiling. Just after everything reverts to normal (halfway into the arc), he starts to grow bigger and bigger until he falls off the Milky Way Galaxy. As he puts it, "this has been a very peculiar afternoon." The 10th anniversary book has Watterson admitting that the story was "weird for weirdness' sake".</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a>: Calvin's parents. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggedTrope">Most of the time, anyway...</a><div class="indent"><strong>Mom:</strong> It's <em>your</em> fault we don't have a sweet little girl! <em>Your</em> stupid chromosome!

When grown up, he wrote his <em>Contrat Social</em>, inspired by <em>Leviathan</em>, the work of Thomas Hobbes. Rousseau also wrote <em>Emile</em>, a thesis on the upbringing of children, claiming that a child should have as much freedom as possible. Cue our titular character (like his namesake, he also believes in predestination-more specifically that he's destined for great things and everything revolves around him).</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalLongevityJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalLongevityJoke">Historical Longevity Joke</a>: Calvin once asked his dad if dinosaurs were around when he was young.

Guess who ends up being hit by the snowball.</li><li> Another in-universe example: Calvin and Hobbes are going to have a water balloon fight. Calvin starts filling balloons, but he keeps messing them up and splashing water on himself.

Calvin claims that they do this to curb human overpopulation, a popular justification for deer hunting.</li><li> Though the Sunday strip where Calvin explains why he hangs out with Hobbes instead of human kids is a heartwarming moment.</li><li> One memorable comic strip...<div class="indent"><strong>Calvin:</strong> Hobbes, look!

This is contrasted with Calvin, whose more extravagant wish for "a trillion billion dollars, my own space shuttle, and a private continent" goes unfulfilled.</li><li> Another time, Calvin and Hobbes are outside and Calvin asks Hobbes what he would wish for if he could have anything. Hobbes wishes for "a big sunny field to be in." Calvin points out that Hobbes is <em>already</em> in a sunny field and says he should wish for something big like power or riches.

Is he real, or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">Imaginary Friend</a>? Debate on this question rages on, though Watterson has said it misses the point and Hobbes' nature is a matter of perspective.</li><li> Some of the more surreal events of the strip. Was Calvin actually abducted by aliens and replaced by a robot double? Did he truly hijack the spaceship of a shape-shifting alien who took his place? How about the Snow Goons? Or the monsters under his bed? They could all be credited to Calvin's imagination, but there's never any proof that they're not real. Hobbes once wrote a good story for Calvin's homework assignment, and Calvin honestly had no idea what it was about until he read it to his class, though critics use this as proof of Calvin being mentally ill.</li><li> Stupendous Man flew to a tree branch ten feet above the ground to drop a snowball witnesses state was the size of a bowling ball onto Susie Derkins. A cubic foot of well-packed snow weighs over <em>twenty pounds.</em> How could Calvin possibly have gotten it up a tree &mdash; much less dropped it onto Susie's head &mdash; without her noticing his presence in a red superhero costume with ground-trailing cape? Although skeptics could suggest that a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToonPhysics">Toon Physics</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> were at play.</li><li> The incident that most fans point to is the time that Calvin asks Hobbes to tie him to a chair so that he can break free. Calvin is tied so tight that his parents are stumped as to how he got himself into the situation, despite Calvin's insistence that Hobbes did it.</li><li> There are several strange things that have little explanation other than that Hobbes <em>is</em> real. As in <em>photographic evidence</em>. When Calvin took a picture of Hobbes "pouncing" on him, it was indeed a picture of Hobbes flying through the air with seemingly no outside force (possibly a friend could have thrown him, but of course Calvin has no friends.) Hobbes once took a photo of Calvin while the boy was sneezing. There was no way Calvin could do this by himself &mdash; setting the time right would be nigh-impossible and we can see Calvin's hands in the photo. Heck, it makes Hobbes pretty impressive; catching someone mid-sneeze would be an impressive feat for a professional photographer. That said, no one else except Calvin and Hobbes sees the photo so one could still say the picture was imaginary.</li><li> The one scene where Susie sees Calvin fighting Hobbes, and <em>losing</em>. Even she admits that she can't explain that one.</li><li> There's the time that Hobbes was missing, and Susie found him, and decided to hold a tea party with him. Enter Calvin, asking Susie if she's seen Hobbes, and rushing over to thank her, kissing her hand. Now, Calvin was in front of Susie the whole time, in her line of sight. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/05/31">But when she turns back to her tea party?<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><div class="indent"> <strong>Susie:</strong> Hey! Who took all the cookies?</div></li><li> There's Calvin's bicycle. He's clearly terrified of it and convinced that it wants to kill him. An easy explanation is that he's creating malicious fantasies to justify his fear of falling off the bike, yet on one occasion, he actually found it "hiding" in his room in an apparent ambush. Could Calvin have overcome his fear enough to move his bike in order to set up an imaginary attack, and then seemingly repressed the memory of having done so, when he normally runs away from it as a matter of course?</li><li> On the other hand, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">incredibly convenient</a> that Calvin's fantastical escapades never line up with what anyone else is seeing or end just as someone else comes into the situation. When Calvin's been transmogrified his mom still sees him as a regular boy, occasionally Hobbes gets cleaned in the washing machine and stitched back up despite Calvin thinking of him as a real tiger, when he showed his dad pictures of dinosaurs he took when he went back in time to the Jurassic, they just looked like plastic toy dinosaurs to him, during the arc where his personal gravity is reversed, he suddenly and inexplicably reverts back to normal the moment his mom appears, in the arc where Stupendous Man supposedly "vaporized" Calvin's school still followed up with Calvin continuing to go to the same school afterwards, it goes on and on.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayIBorrowACupOfSugar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayIBorrowACupOfSugar">May I Borrow a Cup of Sugar?</a>: The usual order of events is inverted in the June 3, 1990 strip (with the joke coming first), in which Susie Derkins goes over to Calvin's house and finds him caught up in one of his "Stupendous Man" fantasies, deciding to just leave after he runs off to continue it. It's not until the last panel shows her coming home that we find out it's this trope, when her mother asks "Did they have an egg you could borrow?", and Susie claims nobody was home.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Meaningful Name</a>: Averted in early strips. The characters both share the names of philosophers, but a read through the early strips shows that any real significance once the strip itself got philosophical is a coincidence. (Calvin was, in fact, originally going to be named Marvin until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Marvin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Marvin">a strip of the same name</a> launched.) Later characterizations played this trope straight. John Calvin was a theologian who believed in predestination, similar to how Calvin often ponders destiny and blames his faults on other forces. Thomas Hobbes was a philosopher who after going through the English civil war wrote the book <em>Leviathan</em>, which advanced a very dim outlook on human nature. Likewise, Calvin's tiger often finds problems with humanity's stupidity, saying that tigers are superior. Other parallels exist, as well.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenagerieOfMisery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenagerieOfMisery">Menagerie of Misery</a>: Hobbes hates the zoo and sees it as equivalent to a prison for animals, as shown in one strip, when Calvin asks to go to the zoo, Hobbes asks Calvin if they can visit a prison afterwards.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentalStory">Mental Story</a>: Even leaving aside the question of whether or not Hobbes is real, a lot of stories take place in Calvin's imagination.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a>: Defied, at the cost of such hostility that Watterson actually thought about quitting the strip.

I hate my life! I hate everything! I wish I was <em>dead!</em> ...Well, no, not really. I wish everyone <em>else</em> was dead."</div><ul><li> At one point, Calvin fantasized about being an ancient god who brings whole worlds into existence and torments those who don't appease him. "The doomed writhe in agony!" The only thing keeping the strip from being mega-creepy is the fact that it ends with the reveal he's playing with Tinkertoys.</li><li> Also, Calvin has no friends aside from Hobbes.

These are the names Calvin gives to the various cliffs and hills he and Hobbes go down in the sled or the wagon, depending on the time of year. Presumably a joke on Watterson's hometown (and ambiguously the setting for the comic; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereTheHellIsSpringfield">Where the Hell Is Springfield?</a>) of <em>Chagrin</em> Falls, Ohio.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">The Napoleon</a>: In one summer strip, Hobbes asks Calvin why he's wearing long pants on a hot day and wonders why he doesn't wear short pants instead.

The combination almost seems hypocritical on Bill Watterson's part. Generally speaking, Patterson tended to defend <em>newspaper</em> comics, which weren't necessarily less stupid at the time, but, at least in his view, had far more potential to convey deep meaning than the comics from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">The Dark Age of Comic Books</a>, which was then the one in progress, that seemed to be in a competition to cram the highest possible death toll into twenty pages.<ul><li> Various remarks by Watterson in the Tenth Anniversary Book include:<div class="indent">"I would suggest that it is not the medium, but the quality of perception and expression that determines the significance of art.

The arc just ends on a strip where Calvin and Hobbes attempt to roast hot dogs over a campfire only to burn them, and then in the next strip they are suddenly back home in their own backyard with no explanation or resolution. Subsequent camping trips usually do wrap it up properly, usually with the family starting to pack up to head back home, something Calvin had been anticipating the whole trip.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven">No Name Given</a>: Calvin's last name, and the names of his parents.

Several minor characters who don't appear but are only mentioned, and then usually just the once, have full names: This includes three of Calvin's classmates and the author of his favorite book.<ul><li> Watterson once commented that he invoked this with Calvin's parents because the strip is presented from Calvin's viewpoint, and as such his parents are only important <em>as</em> his parents. Part of the reason that Uncle Max never made any further appearances in the strip was that Watterson found it awkward that Max couldn't refer to Calvin's parents by their names.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a>: While Calvin's parents &mdash; and especially his mom &mdash; will occasionally indulge in his fantasies and games, there are also times when they simply refuse to put up with his bad attitude and ignore him.<ul><li> In one strip, Calvin covers himself with a cardboard box and pretends to be a robot probe from Jupiter in an attempt to steal some chocolate from the pantry. Calvin's mom doesn't even look up from her coffee and tells him no, then remarks "Go back to Jupiter, X-3 whatever" when he threatens her with a dart gun.</li><li> Calvin once claimed to have a stick of dynamite (really a hot dog with some string attached) and threatened to blow the house up if he didn't get cookies.

Later, the bathroom is cleaned and Calvin is already in bed, and asks Mom to check his homework for him. Then the next morning, Calvin is up and out of bed without being called and eager for school.

What's more, Calvin goes to great lengths to instill this antipathy in his parents (hiding dead bugs in his own mother's shampoo, blockading his dad's driveway with snowmen so he'll be late to work). The pair can't even have a nice dinner out without Calvin destroying the house in their absence. Hence, when badgered with letters regarding Calvin's cruel parents, Watterson simply said, "They do a better job than I would." On the other hand, there are things that Calvin's parents could be criticized for that seem to be independent of the possible effects of his brattiness on them. Good examples are found mainly with Calvin's father, who drags his family on camping trips they hate and can be preachy, like all the times when he tells Calvin that doing things he hates builds character.

But while writing the story he realized Max wasn't bringing out any new sides to Calvin, and also found it awkward to write around Max not addressing his brother and sister-in-law by name, so Uncle Max boarded a plane and went home, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongBusTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongBusTrip">never to appear in the strip again</a>.<ul><li> Rosalyn disappeared halfway through the strip's run but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">returned</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">for one final story arc</a> in September 1995.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QualityOverQuantity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QualityOverQuantity">Quality over Quantity</a>: In a water balloon fight, Calvin brags to Hobbes how he has the overwhelming advantage because he's got three water balloons as opposed to Hobbes' one and taunts about how he will drench Hobbes thoroughly. Hobbes simply tosses his balloon to Calvin, who screams that his hands are full, resulting in him getting quadruple-drenched.

In a more conventional strip, Calvin would've practiced until he was a champion, then scored for his team. Instead, he gets hit in the nose with a grounder when he tries playing with his dad, then, when he actually plays for the team, he ends up making them lose (due to them not bothering to tell him that they're switching places), causing them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoreLoser">harshly yell at him</a>.

In the comic's first strip we see Calvin captured Hobbes in a tiger-trap.

In particular, in some strips he only wants to play outside, while in others he can't imagine doing anything but watching TV, usually dependent on which one his parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConflictBall">least want him to do</a>, or just for an opportunity to mock television.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a>: <em>Many</em>.

Either Calvin uses phrases copied verbatim from art journals to describe his snow men, or his breathless praises of comic books as an art form are interrupted by comments like: "Oh no, Captain Steroid's getting his kidneys punched out with an I-beam!" Watterson's career peaked during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">The Dark Age of Comic Books</a>, which likely influenced his opinions quite a bit, but as to why he didn't seek out fellow "comics can be art" proponents such as <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveSim">Dave Sim</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottMcCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScottMcCloud">Scott McCloud</a> and join up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GraphicNovel">Graphic Novel</a> movement is a mystery.</li><li> Watterson directed a few Take Thats at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a></em> creator <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimDavis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimDavis">Jim Davis</a> over the years. In a rare 1987 interview, he harshly condemned Davis' comic strip <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/USAcres">U.S. Acres</a></em>, calling it stupid and badly done. In <em>The Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book</em>, Watterson extensively discusses why he hates merchandising, and how it robs a comic strip of its heart and soul. He even writes about how a cartoonist risks becoming a "factory foreman," remarking on how he went into cartooning "to draw cartoons, not to run a corporate empire." He disgustedly remarks on how he would have sold out his own creation if he'd done this. Given the context, it was pretty clear who he was talking about. Granted, since Jim Davis stated that he created Garfield for the purpose of making money, and probably didn't intend there to be much of that deeper significance in which Watterson puts so much stock, it's unlikely that Watterson would have liked it anyway.</li><li> Bill Watterson's foreword to <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillAmend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillAmend">Bill Amend</a>'s first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a></em> book is an extended take that against Jim Davis. For example, Watterson champions Quincy the Iguana for not thinking "the cute thoughts that quickly get most comic strip animals in the greeting card business."</li><li> Watterson had Calvin reading from <em>Chewing</em>, a magazine that rated chewing gums in excruciating detail (e.g., "[T]he top five brands of chewing gum based on flavor retention, elasticity, bubble capacity, and chewing rebound,") offered advice for chewing it, and otherwise was a spot-on parody of <em>every</em> review mag. Specifically, Watterson based <em>Chewing</em> off a lot of bicycling magazines he'd read.</li><li> Watterson made several strips with subtle jabs at his editors and the syndication people.</li><li> There is a Take That related to <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em>, although not in the strip itself. For strips in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty">Bloom County</a></em> that parodied cartoon cats that featured characters such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield">Garfield</a> and Hobbes, Bill Watterson retaliated hilariously with <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030516031339/http://ignatz.brinkster.net/cimages/cbreathedsketch.jpg">this comic<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a><small>&loz;</small>. In response Berkeley Breathed said this:<div class="indent"> "I have committed other thefts with a clean and unfettered conscience. <em>Garfield</em> was too calculated and too successful not to freely raid for illicit character cameos. <em>Calvin and Hobbes</em> was too good not to. <em>Calvin</em> creator Bill Watterson took these thefts in stride and retaliated in private with devastatingly effective illustrated salvos, hitting me in my most vulnerable places. Bill's sketch is an editorial comment on my addiction to the expensive sport of power boating and the moral compromises needed to fund it. That's me doing the kicking. The chap on the dock represents my cartoon syndicate boss, which says it all, methinks."</div></li><li> In one comic Calvin talks about wanting to be a talk radio host. It ends with him saying "Imagine getting <em>paid</em> to act like a six-year-old!" The strip in question was published in 1994, right around when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RushLimbaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/RushLimbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> was first beginning to attract a wide audience.</li><li> Watterson has very choice words about his disdain for "graphic novels" in the collection books. Given what Watterson says about the term "graphic novel" in the Tenth Anniversary Book, it's possible he had a very cynical viewpoint of the term and had his impressions of comic books too colored by the contemporary examples he had in front of him to listen to anyone talking about it being a legitimate art form.</li><li> In one strip, he also took a jab at comic book collectors of the time, which eventually became vindicated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatComicsCrashOf1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGreatComicsCrashOf1996">comic industry crash of the mid-90's</a>, which was in part caused by the oversaturation of the market with worthless "collectors" comics.</li><li> Watterson makes it clear in the collection books that the appeal of sports is completely lost on him, which is also best summed up by the cruel treatment Calvin goes through during the baseball arc.</li><li> In one comic, Watterson takes a jab at DEVO and their 'Easy-Listening Muzak.'</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingHeads">Talking Heads</a>: in one strip, Watterson complains about the prevalence of this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewspaperComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewspaperComics">Newspaper Comics</a>.
