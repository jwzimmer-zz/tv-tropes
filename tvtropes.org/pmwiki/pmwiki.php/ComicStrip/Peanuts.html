Also, by his own admission, Schulz looked at his drawings of Faron and realized uncomfortably that he couldn't draw cats very well. When he got rid of the cat, his only regret was naming it after Faron Young, his favorite country singer. In the late 1960s, Schulz would introduce the unseen, (originally) unnamed "The Cat Next Door", and was much more pleased with the results.</li><li> What had been intended as a lengthy &#150; possibly months-long &#150; arc with Linus and Lucy's family moving away came to a very sudden end because fans objected.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedForChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbridgedForChildren">Abridged for Children</a>: Charles Schulz poked fun at this trope in an early '60s comic strip:<div class="indent"><strong>Violet:</strong> What are you reading? <br><strong>Charlie Brown:</strong> This is an adaptation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>. <br><strong>Violet:</strong> An adaptation? <br><strong>Charlie Brown:</strong> Yes, it's been adapted for children...

In one story arc, Charlie Brown went to talk to his pediatrician to find out why the school board (which the doctor was a member of) had banned a book called <em>The Six Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out</em> from the school library. The doctor fainted. The nurse later told Charlie Brown that little kids made him nervous. (Remember, this was a <em>pediatrician</em>.) Later, Charlie Brown told Linus that the doctor admitted that he only reads medical journals, but the pictures upset him.</li><li> Another story arc shows that Peppermint Patty's teacher is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> type. A hole in the ceiling classroom was causing rain to fall on Patty's head. According to Marcie, the teacher couldn't move Patty to another desk, because that would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">disrupt the alphabetical seating arrangement.</a></li><li> There was <em>one</em> animated special, <em>Snoopy's Reunion</em>, where there are not only adults seen, they can be heard. It's the one where Charlie Brown gets Snoopy for the first time. We see the puppy farm owner and he even talks.</li><li> <em>Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown!</em> had a couple of adult characters who appeared on camera and spoke normally: the cab driver who took Snoopy to Wimbledon, and the teacher at the French school. There is also a London waiter who speaks in a thick Cockney accent that the kids can't comprehend, and Violette's uncle, "The Baron," who speaks normally but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">appears only in silhouette</a>.</li><li> And more background adults (or possibly teenagers) at the club in <em>Flashbeagle</em>.</li><li> Adults are heard, but not seen, in <em>She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown</em>, but that's due to the storyline <em>requiring</em> intelligible adults for once (most notably, the rink announcer).</li><li> The adults in <em>This Is America, Charlie Brown</em>.

Even then they're only seen from the neck or legs down, or as outlines in distant crowd shots (as part of a storyline involving Lucy participating in a golf tournament). The perspectives are noticably wonky, with the kids barely reaching the adults' knees; notably, those three Sunday strips were not reprinted in any <em>Peanuts</em> collection until Fantagraphics put out the 1953-1954 edition of <em>The Complete Peanuts</em>.<ul><li> We see an adult doctor (or, rather, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Linus's drawing of one</a>) in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1964/11/08">this 1964 strip<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.</li></ul></li><li> The strips where Rerun was carried along with his mom when she went bike riding showed her, though admittedly they only showed her back, and she never said anything.</li><li> Charlie Brown does go to his father's barber shop and comments on how great his father is for showing him affection.</li><li> Violet always took unseemly pride in comparing her father's accomplishments with those of the other kids'.</li><li> Off-screen, there had to be a whole townful of adults giving Halloween trick-or-treaters treats, and rocks to Charlie Brown.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfraidOfNeedles">Afraid of Needles</a>:<ul><li> Linus is not only afraid of getting shots, he's scared when he has to get a sliver taken out of his finger with a needle or tweezers.

After having his mother remove the sliver &mdash; indicated by an off-panel scream from Linus &mdash; he came back and said, "I told them where the gold was buried!")</li><li> In one arc, Lucy and Peppermint Patty wanted to get their ears pierced, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">and Marcie was a big help</a>, telling them about all the dangers of getting that done by an unskilled amateur; Patty almost freaked when Marcie mentioned a penicillin shot.

At the time this was a straight reference, while in reprints it looks as though it's a gag on how Lucy and/or Snoopy are out of touch.</li><li> The character Jos&eacute; Peterson represented a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeltingPotNomenclature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeltingPotNomenclature">Melting-Pot Nomenclature</a> joke at the time, as the idea of someone with a Swedish father and Mexican mother seemed like a bizarrely unlikely combination - it wouldn't be seen as that remarkable in the modern US.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThisIsFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThisIsFor">And This Is for...</a>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeMyValentineCharlieBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeMyValentineCharlieBrown">Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown</a></em>, when Linus is unable to give his candy to Miss Othmar because she left with her boyfriend, he feels so upset that he goes up onto a bridge and starts throwing off the candies one by one (Snoopy and Woodstock both catch the candies in their mouths and eat them).

Even Schroeder got in on the action, adding, as Linus was about to throw another rock: "THIS is for people who don't like Beethoven!" Linus repeated, "YEAH!

Snoopy would often interact with said music notes, such as shoving them aside so he could lie on the piano, slipping himself in between the bars, using it as a bowling lane and striking the notes down like pins, etc. Schroeder also once weaponized this against Lucy, making the music notes appear and shove her off the piano.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a>:<ul><li> Snoopy. The first couple of years of the strip had him being a non-entity who never spoke and was treated as a secondary character. But he quickly became arguably the most famous character of the series. There's a reason the official name of the strip's website was "snoopy.com" for much of the internet era (both before and years after Schulz's death).</li><li> Alternatively, you have Lucy (upstaging original female lead characters Patty and Violet) and Peppermint Patty, who had her own supporting cast of sorts (Franklin, Marcie, and occasionally Jos&eacute; Peterson).</li><li> Schulz admitted in the liner notes to one book that Peppermint Patty was probably the only one of his characters besides Charlie Brown who could carry a strip by herself.</li><li> In the late 1950s, the strip had a heavy focus on Lucy and Linus; they both tended to appear in more strips than Charlie Brown, along with Snoopy. It could be because for much of the first decade of the strip, Lucy and Linus were the only kids to be siblings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome">while the rest of the kids were only children</a>, prior to Charlie Brown's sister Sally being born in 1959.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a>: Poor Charlie Brown can barely go a day without being miserable.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">Break the Haughty</a>: Sometimes Charlie Brown will get a few small victories, making him cocky, only to fail due to his overconfidence.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a>: The first strip about kicking the football had Violet (not Lucy) moving the ball because she was afraid Charlie Brown would miss and kick her arm. <em>Decades</em> later, Lucy promises to let Charlie Brown kick the football if he gets out of the hospital. When he does, she makes good on the promise&#133; and, sure enough, he misses and kicks Lucy's arm.<ul><li> The strip of December 22, 1962 references the San Francisco Giants' heartbreaking loss in Game 7 of that year's World Series two months earlier, with a despondent Charlie Brown asking, "Why couldn't (Willie) McCovey have hit the ball just three feet higher?" Then, in the January 28, 1963 strip, Charlie Brown (apparently still not quite over it) wails, "Or why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball even <em>two</em> feet higher?"</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a>: Despite his intelligence and wit, Linus is an average student at best - several storylines in the early and mid-1960s dealt with Linus's parents' and teachers' disappointment over his poor grades and/or failing to make the honor roll, since he has such great potential. In Linus's own words, "THERE'S NO HEAVIER BURDEN THAN A GREAT POTENTIAL!" A big part of the problem, though, seems to be that he's just not motivated, since he often makes up excuses to get out of doing his homework or studying for tests.<ul><li> Although another explanation for Linus's poor grades may be that he doesn't do as well in school without his security blanket. In a 1962 strip, Linus explains that having his blanket at school "calms [him] down, and helps [him] to get better grades," and went on to add, "Nobody laughs at a straight A average!" However, in a later storyline, Miss Othmar forbade Linus to bring the blanket to school.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblePipe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubblePipe">Bubble Pipe</a>: Snoopy uses one of these in the special <em>It's a Mystery, Charlie Brown</em>, where he's playing a detective trying to find Woodstock's nest.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">Buffy Speak</a>: Snoopy's novel <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1999/10/03">The Lonesome Horse Person<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a></em>.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>:<ul><li> Charlie Brown is the unequivocal epitome of this trope, with a goodly amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a> and <img src="/images/article-hreficon-ymmv.png" class="ymmv1 rounded" title="This example contains a YMMV entry.

A stack of tomato cans is interpreted as a pop art installation by Peppermint Patty, while a meat market is declared by Sally to be an exhibit of dinosaur bones (she had no idea they were so expensive, a nod to the rapidly rising price of meat when the special aired in 1973).

Also, in at least 1953 and 1954, it seems that Schulz couldn't decide whether to use normal word balloons or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoughtBubbleSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoughtBubbleSpeech">Thought Bubble Speech</a> for his dialogue (although in instances where normal balloons were used, it was still clear that the other characters couldn't hear him).</li><li> In a few early strips, adult characters actually spoke with the children (although this always happened with the word balloons coming from off-panel).</li><li> Lucy was a wide-eyed, cute little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">Cloudcuckoolander</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdPersonPerson">spoke in third person</a> and appeared to be toddler-aged, almost nothing like her later bossy, crabby, mean self.</li><li> Linus and Schroeder first appeared as babies.</li><li> The first pulling-the-football-away strip had Violet instead of Lucy, and she pulled it away from Charlie Brown out of fear he'd kick her hand rather than malice.

In a strip from December of 1989, she's getting ready to throw around a football with Marcie. It's very cold, but that's no problem, because Patty has a hoodie to keep her warm! Telling Marcie to kick the ball to her as soon as she gets it on, she puts it on <em>backwards</em> and then pulls the hood up, yes, <em>over her face</em>. Not able to see a thing, she misses the catch and gets hit in the head with the football a moment later.<ul><li> Although it's possible she put it over her face on purpose to protect her face from the ball, since Marcie is so inept at anything sports-related. After all, Marcie is the one whose reply to Patty asking her to join her baseball team was, "What if I get put in the penalty box?"</li></ul></li><li> Most of the gang's baseball games go poorly, but once, in the first game of the season, they give up a hundred runs. In another game, where Peppermint Patty is a guest pitcher, she pitches a no-hit game and makes five home runs and the team still ends up behind 37 to 5, leading her to quit in frustration. And if Charlie Brown is involved, even Peppermint Patty's team is vulnerable: in a 1981 storyline, Patty let Charlie Brown take over for her as pitcher, with her team leading 50-0 and two outs in the bottom of the ninth. They lost 51-50.<ul><li> Still, none of this compares to one 1959 strip in which Charlie Brown's team lost <em>600-0</em>.</li><li> Nevertheless, Charlie Brown's team has been shown to win some games - mainly the ones in which Charlie Brown does not play. A rare exception to this rule occurred in a 1973 storyline in which Charlie Brown's team managed to eke out a victory because Rerun kept getting "walked" at bat. However, even this ended badly, as the team were forced to forfeit due to a gambling scandal involving Rerun and Snoopy.</li></ul></li><li> All of the decathletes in <em>You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown</em> - except for Marcie - fail in epic fashion in at least one event.<ul><li> Charlie Brown gets off lightest; he finishes last in the 100m and 400m, but his worst performances are in the 110m hurdles, when he knocks over every hurdle but one and finishes last by several seconds, and the 1500m, when he is so elated by taking an early lead that he closes his eyes and misses the first turn in the track completely, running out of the stadium and out of contention.</li><li> Freddie Fabulous, the Fremont school champion, collides face first with the bar in the high jump on only his first jump, and trips while gearing up to throw the discus and falls flat on his face.</li><li> But it's the Ace Obedience School champion, the Masked Marvel (better known as Snoopy), who racks up the most embarrassing failures; he drops the shot on his foot in the shot put, his attempt to hop gracefully over the high jump bar ends in disaster when he lands on the bar instead and is launched halfway across the field, he ends up throwing the discus straight up into the air and unsuccessfully tries to outrun it when it lands again and spins around like a runaway wheel, and he gets his collar stuck on the pole during the pole vault and is launched halfway across the field again. Peppermint Patty later tells Charlie Brown that "the Masked Marvel" and Freddie Fabulous also got into a fight on the last lap of the 1500m and were both disqualified. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Small wonder Marcie ends up winning the decathlon!</span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EskimosArentReal">Eskimos Aren't Real</a>: Lucy once spent several strips mocking Charlie Brown for telling her that birds fly south for the winter: "In all my life, Charlie Brown, I have never met anyone with an imagination like yours!"

After being sent to the principal's office for deliberately defying the dress code and wearing her usual shirt, shorts and sandals, she hired Snoopy as her lawyer and tried to challenge the dress code before the school board.

Often it was the result of Lucy doing something to try to "break him of the habit," such as burying the blanket or making a kite out of the blanket and then letting go of it, but sometimes it was voluntary. A few times it even <em>almost</em> worked, but invariably something happened to make him "relapse": for example, Charlie Brown buying him a new blanket to make up for the one Snoopy had made into two sport coats (1971), or the discovery that his only pupil for his "security blanket cessation" clinic was Sally in disguise (1983).<ul><li> Lucy also got a taste of this when her mother decided to get rid of the TV set because she and Linus had constantly fought over it.

He agrees to do it, but spends most of the game asking her for a chance to pitch. Peppermint Patty, who knows exactly how bad Charlie Brown is at baseball (or so she thought), rejects him every time. That is, until the very end of the game, when her team is so far ahead - they have a fifty to nothing lead, and it's the last of the ninth, two outs - that she decides it's impossible for them to lose anyway, so she lets him pitch just this one time. The first thing Charlie Brown does, is to throw a wild pitch that knocks Patty unconscious. Then he somehow causes her team to lose fifty-one to fifty.

Although the wardrobes used to be much <em>more</em> limited; Linus became famous in a red-and-black striped tee, Peppermint Patty in a green one (plus flip-flops), and the other girls in color-coded dresses with puffed sleeves and a bow sash. In the early 1970s, Sally began appearing in shirts and pants as often as in her trademark blue-with-black-polka-dots dress, and Schulz would drop the 'girls in dresses, boys/tomboys in shorts or pants' meme completely by the end of the '80s.</li><li> Enforced almost absurdly in <em>It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown</em>. The kids are in their default outfits during the football game; the only concessions to football are the helmets, puffier shoulders suggesting pads, and cleats.

Sensing Peppermint Patty's crush on Charlie Brown, Marcie asks if she likes him, and a flustered Peppermint Patty snaps, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeIsNotMyBoyfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeIsNotMyBoyfriend">Who could ever be in love with boring, dull, wishy-washy old Chuck?</a>" Unbeknownst to her, Charlie Brown is within earshot of this remark, and he trudges off, his self-esteem obliterated, to Peppermint Patty's horror.

Lucy got her revenge when he went to her psychiatric booth for advice on dealing with his guilt and the first thing she did was to slug him.</li><li> Charlie Brown also dealt with this after yelling at Sally (then still a baby) for messing up his picture puzzle (1959) and trading Snoopy to Peppermint Patty's baseball team in exchange for some new players (1967). In the latter storyline, Charlie Brown decided to call off the deal, which turned out to be a moot point because the players Patty would have traded to him steadfastly refused to join Charlie Brown's team anyway.</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a>: The iPhone game "Snoopy's Street Fair" reintroduces Faron (Frieda has a cat-petting booth), depicts Lydia running a "Guess the Name" game, and shows Emily selling dance supplies and Shermy selling root beer <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1950/10/18">as in this extremely early strip<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

During an important football game Lucy pulls the ball from Charlie's kick, losing the game. She proceeds to blame <em>him</em> &#150; and the others go along with her.</li><li> Peppermint Patty also tends to dominate her conversations with Charlie Brown, never letting him get a word in edgewise as he attempts to object to or correct her. Then she yells at him when things don't live up to her expectations (though Marcie usually tries to talk her down). "I hate talking to you, Chuck!" Patty will also shift the blame onto Charlie Brown for things that are really her fault - such as failing a test because she talked with him on the phone instead of studying, when <em>she's</em> the one who called <em>him</em>. In a 1984 strip, she tries to blame him for her being sent to the principal's office for attacking a classmate, and her rationale is, "You're my friend, right, Chuck?

The Red Baron is an antagonist in Snoopy's imagination, the kite-eating tree seems to be how Charlie Brown's mind is able to accept so much bad luck with kites, and that was it for a number of years. The animated special <em>Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown!</em> broke tradition and added a team of no-good bullies from parts unknown to torment the gang.</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">No Ending</a>: The last true strip (the actual last strip is a letter from Schulz to his fans accompanied by recycled artwork) has Charlie Brown explaining his vast knowledge of love letters to Sally; when she notes his expertise, the punchline has him saying "If I ever got one, I don't know what I'd do."

Years earlier he tried the same thing with Charlie Brown. The first time he asked to have the blanket back Charlie Brown promptly obliged.

A few days later, Charlie Brown asked Snoopy to tell him what had happened on the way to the puppy farm to give Snoopy "cold paws," and Snoopy responded by screaming "AAUGH!" and fleeing. The incident was never discussed again.<ul><li> We also never learn what happened to Snoopy in his appearance before the Head Beagle after Frieda reported him for not chasing rabbits; all Snoopy says is, "Fortunately, the Head Beagle was very understanding."</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodlePeople">Noodle People</a>: Spike <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1975/08/13">in his earlier appearances<img src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" height="12" width="12" style="border:none;"></a>.

Then months after Lucy's debut in 1952, Linus was born. In 1959, Sally Brown was born, making Charlie Brown a big brother. By the end of the strip's run, the only <em>Peanuts</em> kids that weren't only children included Charlie and Sally Brown, Lucy and Linus and Rerun Van Pelt, and the kids 3, 4 and 5 95472.

Lucy never misses a chance to list off all of Charlie Brown's faults: in a 1964 storyline (later adapted into the script of <em>A Boy Named Charlie Brown</em> in 1969), she not only forced him to sit through a <em>slide show presentation</em> of all of his faults, but then got mad when he refused to reimburse her $143 for renting the projector, making up the slides, and so on (not to mention $100 of that sum was Lucy's "personal fee").</li><li> In one Sunday strip from 1969, Lucy delivered a Reason You Suck Speech to Charlie Brown using a variety of sports analogies in one session at her psychiatric booth. Fortunately, this time Charlie Brown had the perfect comeback ready.<div class="indent"><strong>Lucy:</strong> You, Charlie Brown, are a foul ball in the line drive of life!

And then there's this example from 1982, delivered by Linus in one of his bolder moments. Despite Lucy's comeback, Linus came away from it feeling immensely satisfied.<div class="indent"><strong>Linus:</strong> Oh, yeah? You should talk! You're the crabbiest person in the whole world!

On the morning after Valentine's Day, Charlie Brown's female classmates approach him, explain that they feel bad he didn't get a single valentine card, and offer him one of their own cards with the original name scratched off and his penciled in. Seeing this, an outraged Schroeder tears into them for their hypocritical gesture:<div class="indent"><strong>Schroeder:</strong> Hold on there! What do you think you're doing? Who do you think you are? Where were you yesterday, when everyone else was giving out valentines? Is kindness and thoughtfulness something you can make retroactive? Don't you think he has any feelings? You and your friends are the most thoughtless bunch I've ever known! You don't care anything about Charlie Brown, you just hate to feel guilty!

Charlie Brown doesn't need your... <br><strong>Charlie Brown</strong> (shoving him aside): Don't listen to him! I'll take it!</div><ul><li> Played more straight in 1966's <em>Charlie Brown's All-Stars</em>, when Schroeder delivers a modified version of the above to Lucy, Violet, Patty, Frieda and Snoopy, even though he had joined them in walking off the team just a few minutes earlier after learning they weren't going to get the promised uniforms.<div class="indent"><strong>Schroeder:</strong> You girls are very thoughtless.

(the series ended with a Yankee victory in the final game when Giants first baseman Willie McCovey hit what would have scored the winning runs directly to the Yankees' second baseman).

This is a novel of old Russia that's <em>over a thousand pages long</em> in most editions. And good ol' Charlie Brown is <em>8</em>. What's even worse is that nobody else seems to have to read it. Even Linus, who is explicitly in the same class (and was sitting behind Charlie Brown when the assignment was given) is never shown so much as picking up the book.

However, everyone else finishes the assignment early in the break where as Charlie Brown does it at three in the morning the day it's due. The fact that his paper was a last-minute rush job (and probably done while sleep-deprived, if the look on his face on the way to school is an indicator) whereas everyone else got it done properly was probably the determining factor in his just-above-failing grade.</li><li> Peppermint Patty had a couple of scary assignments also.

Almost none of his tricks go as planned...<ul><li> His first two tricks - pulling a rabbit (well, Woodstock with rabbit ears tied to his head) out of a top hat and the "linking rings" trick - seem to work, but a heckler in the front row ruins the effect by shouting "That's no rabbit!" for the first trick and challenging Snoopy to take the rings apart again for the second (at which Snoopy fails). The beagle conjurer forcibly shuts up the heckler both times.</li><li> Things go downhill when Snoopy starts recruiting members of the audience to assist him. Franklin volunteers for the "stick through the box" trick, but instead of appearing to pass through his body, the stick jabs him in the head, causing him to leap out of the box in agony. Peppermint Patty ends up worse off when she volunteers for the "amputation-decapitation cabinet" trick and has her head, torso, and legs scrambled, with Snoopy apparently unable to put her back together again until she finally forces her way out of the cabinet.</li><li> A "demonstration of telepathy" is more successful - which may have something to do with the fact that Marcie, to whom Snoopy whispers the identities of the objects Sally is holding, is not blindfolded - but a "cut and restore" trick for which Lucy volunteers a horrified Linus' blanket goes badly as Snoopy is able to do the first part but not the second. The sight of his blanket still in pieces when Snoopy pulls it out of the hat causes Linus to faint dead away.</li><li> Lucy herself ends up on the stage for the next trick, a levitation act. It seems to work at first, as Snoopy puts a blanket over her and makes her rise into the air, then sweeps a hoop down her body to show that there are no wires holding her up - but as he is bowing to the audience's applause, Lucy abruptly falls out of the air with a thud.</li><li> After returning to the audience in a daze, Lucy supplies a third volunteer, this time going from the unwilling to the unwitting as Charlie Brown is summoned to the stage for a disappearing act. Judging from Snoopy and Marcie's shocked reactions when the blanket is removed to reveal that he really <em>has</em> disappeared, they were not expecting the trick to work as it did. And when a sudden rainstorm breaks out and the audience and other performers flee, the invisible Charlie Brown is left alone on stage.</li></ul></li><li> In the comics, any school play is guaranteed to be full of flubbed lines and missed cues, as in these two storylines both adapted into the script of the second <em>Peanuts</em> Christmas special, <em>It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown</em> (1992).<ul><li> Sally is given a part as an angel in a Christmas play in a 1983 storyline, with only one word to say: "Hark!"

Meow! Moo! Whatever!" to riotous laughter from the audience and angry embarrassment from Marcie, who drags her offstage with her shepherd's crook. Although it's likely Patty flubbed the scene on purpose, as she had been insanely jealous that Marcie had been cast as Mary and not her ("MARY NEVER WORE GLASSES!!!") and she <em>had</em> remembered to say "Baa!" earlier in the show, but at the wrong time...<div class="indent"> <strong>Franklin:</strong> I am Gabriel.

Eventually the crossover was returned when Schulz climaxed a 1970s story about Charlie Brown hallucinating baseballs everywhere with a cameo by <em>Mad</em> mascot Alfred E Neuman.

And Lord help them if they <em>lose the game</em>...</li><li> Lucy is shown to be a sore loser as well. In one early strip, she got so frustrated by her inability to shoot a marble correctly that she flew into a rage and stomped on Charlie Brown's and Schroeder's marbles.

She'll also ask her big brother to play "hit man" by slugging or punching her "Sweet 'n' Sour Babboo" in revenge, which Charlie Brown is understandably reluctant to do.</li><li> Peppermint Patty is a bit more sweet towards Charlie Brown than she is towards anyone else, but is still prone to blow up at him if things don't go her way.<ul><li> Marcie sometimes shows tendencies of this as well.
