the strengths of Melancholic but some of the weaknesses of a Sanguine <br />** Gl.k is Sanguine<br />*** Nel has the strengths of Phlegmatic but the weaknesses of a Sanguine.<br />* [[spoiler:FreudianExcuse: Gar, though not a villan (More a [[VillainProtagonist Baddie main character]] like all other irkens) Is Insane because ever since her hatchday she was treated diffrently the Tallest used her as thier personal slave and as her hatred for them grew she gained a [[HearingVoices Voice in her head]] (Commonly known today as anti Gar) Who fed her hatred with lies until she snapped and tried to kill the tallest.]]<br />[[spoiler:** Another example is Melissa whom was born sadistic from her hatchday but was also ridiculled by many she also had a voice in her head (A bit [[WritingAroundTrademarks similar to Gar&#039;s trait]] but both are [[VeryLooselyBasedOnATrueStory true traits of thier creators]]) And enjoys torturing humans in sadistic ways.]] <br />* FriendshipMoment: When Gar saved Melissa moments from death after she was captiured by Alyssa.<br />** When Deef went through embarassing hell to save Alyssa from Melissa and Gar [[spoiler: Although justified since Deef has a crush on Alyssa]]<br />* FromNobodyToNightmare: Melissa [[UsedToBeASweetKid was just a normal smeet]], but then she got bullied like hell, killed many people, became a PsychopathicManchild, [[UpToEleven got a obsession with drinking blood]] and many other horrible things.<br />** Gar also was a normal smeet, whom the tallest chose to use as their personal ChewToy, went insane and tried to kill the tallest.<br />* GeniusBookClub: Often tried by Melissa to out geek Deef, although to avoid a [[BattleOfWits who&#039;s the smartest fight]] [[InvoluntaryBattleToTheDeath TO THE]] [[PunctuatedForEmphasis DEATH!]] Melissa and Deef&#039;s creators have agreed that they are both equally intelligent.<br />* GenkiGirl: Buu used to be this before Characterization Kicked in. <br />** San is this, obvously since she&#039;s a ShoutOut to [[Manga/MamotteLollipop San]].<br />* GoodIsNotNice: Alyssa and Deef, Mainly Alyssa though considering she [[spoiler: Tried to kill Melissa even when the latter stated she never even wanted to destroy earth and simply enjoyed toying with her and Deef]] <br />* GoshDangItToHeck: The creators of this use the words Keel, sheet and other subversions.<br />* GravitySucks: Whenever a person is deffieing gravity, The MINUTE somebody questions the logicallity Gravity kicks in.<br />** Played with where

too delicious to resist) or touch water unless coted in paste, without screaming in pain and steaming.<br />* HandyRemoteControl: Greatest example would be the remote control Melissa used to painfully Shock Alyssa, whenever Deef tried to foil her plan for making Deef, her and Gar&#039;s temporary slave.<br />* HearingVoices: Melissa with Maria, Gar with anti Gar, both are the ??? flavor.<br />* HeroicBSOD: Wunny and GD Jir both got one of these once, probably the most notible example was when Gar had a nightmare of Gl.k killing her and she avoided him for a few days and was totally out of it.<br />* HighCollarOfDoom: Gl.k has one of these.<br />* HisStoryRepeatsItself: Riz&#039; (Jir&#039;s Riz) multiple appearence that cause him to almost win but ultimatley be defeated.<br />* HoldingBackthePhlebotinum: quite a bit, One good example is Jir who is a all powerful death mechine, but holds back his insane powers because he&#039;s somewhat cowardly and JUST TOO DANG NICE!<br />* HollywoodPersonalityDisorders: Melissa is a example of Sadistic Personality disorder, she even flat out admitted it to Deef. <br />** Also Gar has OCD (Because her creator also has it) even a personified version of it commonly known as Anti Gar.<br />* HorribleJudgeOfCharacter: Deef seems to believe Melissa is because of her refusal to agree that Gar is a idiot (Although she really isn&#039;t Deef&#039;s just a JERK!)<br />* IAteWhat: Melissa had a red drink and Deef asked what it was. She told him to drink it and find out. He thought it was koolaid, It [[OhCrap was]] [[ImAHumanitarian not koolaid]]<br />* ICantFeelMyLegs: Boo, Melissa&#039;s [[ShoutOut LEAST FAVORITE CREATION]], often states this despite never having legs in the first place.<br />* IKnowYoureinThereSomewhereFight: Jir gets this wherever he&#039;s reprogrammed. <br />* ImprobableAge: Deef and Alyssa are around 13 years old, yet they fight 130 year old aliens on a regular basis ([[JustifiedTrope Justified since 130 year old irkens are the equivalent of a 13 year old child]].<br />* InertialDampening: Jir gave Deef a berry that had this effect ,making him immune to interal affects of Irken food.<br />* InfiniteSupplies:You barely EVER see anyone at stores to buy things they should have run out of.<br />* InfraredXRayCamera: Deef and Melissa have one in thier goggles.<br />* InnocentAliens: Dorp and Zarn are this, they don&#039;t hate Earth Zarn&#039;s just hiding out there and Dorp doesn&#039;t want to leave because of Nel.<br />* IntergenerationalFriendship: Dorp and Nel. Nel is a 10-13 year old human while Dorp is technically 140 human years old (Although he&#039;s the equivilant to a 14 year old teenager on his planet so it may be [[JustifiedTrope justfied)]].<br />* InterspeciesFriendship: Any Irken-human friendships.<br />* InterspeciesRomance: Dorp (Irken) and Nel (Human).<br />* InvisibilityCloak: This is a world where NOT having one is weird.<br />* InvoluntaryShapeshifter: This was a idea that was somewhat discarded with Jir and only has a DayInTheLimelight every so often.<br />* ItsAllAboutMe: Gl.k is a very, very vain person as most irkens are, also Bunny used to be this.<br />* IWillPunishYourFriendForYourFailure: involved in one of Melissa&#039;s most elaborate plan.<br />* JerkassDissonance: Melissa is so Evil yet many people (except Deef and Alyssa) like her.<br />* JetPack: Sir units have this in their feet.<br />* KidsAreCruel: In a NoodleIncident with Melissa she was picked on quite a bit at the irken acadamy plus Kids on earth are no better. <br />** Most notably Nel who was majorly bullied at Skool.<br />* KillerRabbit: Wunny for obvious reasons.<br />* KillItWithWater: Deef and Alyssa will often douse Gar or Melissa in water.<br />* LackOfEmpathy: Interspeicies empathy does not exsist (Save for Nel).<br />* LeaningOnTheFourthWall: --&gt; Alyssa: This is just depressing. I feel like I&#039;m the creation of some sort of sick, twisted mind who hates me so much that they won&#039;t let me die, but suffer until the point I wish I could. <br />* LEGOGenetics: GD Nel specializes in this.<br />* LivingBattery: Irken Paks may be this since they don&#039;t need sleep (With exceptions like Melissa who&#039;s PAK is slightly defective and can&#039;t self-recharge like normal Paks).<br />* LonersAreFreaks: Deef and Alyssa are freaks in diffrent fields, Alyssa is a BeetleManiac and Deef is a ChildProdigy.<br />* MadeOfExplodium: Nano (Formerly) seems to be since everytime he is smart [[YourHeadASplode His head Asploads!]]<br />* MadeOfPhlebotinum:Might as well be with how 95% of the characters aren&#039;t from this world.<br />* MagicAntidote: Jir&#039;s berries are deffanly this.<br />* MagicFromTechnology: Alot of Irkens and sirs have magical abilities.<br />* MasculineGirlFeminineBoy: Buu (Girl) and Iro (Boy) <br />** Buu (XD Again) and Len (Boy). <br />*** Bunny (boy) Moosie (girl).<br />*** [[spoiler: Also Melissa thinks Alyssa and Deef are like this although she may just be taking a huge wack at Deef]]<br />* MeaningfulName: Gar&#039;s name is a combination of Gir and Gaz, Jir was the cutest male name ending in -ir, Melissa was named after her creator, Jay was named and based of of [[Literature/WarriorCats Jayfeather]], Riz (Jir)&#039;s creator was eating Rice while creating him, Micky was named after her creators friend Mickayla, Riley is Named after His/Her creator&#039;s friend Riley, Maria means bitter the list goes on.<br />* MentalPictureProjector: Gar&#039;s dream projector.<br />* MoodSwinger: Jay envokes this trope because he&#039;s a JerkWithAHeartOfGold.<br />* MoralMyopia: Fip tries to justify Melissa&#039;s potential drinking of human blood by saying &quot;at least it wasn&#039;t anyone you knew&quot;. <br />** All Irkens seem to think like this<br />* {{Nanomachines}}:Melissa&#039;s S.I.R Micky can turn into a nanobot so she will be unoticed when keeping tabs on people.<br />* NightmareFuelColoringBook: Melissa owns one of these, either used to draw nightmarish pictures of Deef and Alyssa being killed or [[spoiler:[[TearJerker Pictures of how alone and afraid she feels]].<br />* NobodyCanDie: In this universe dying is only PlayedForLaughs or PlayedForDrama. But in the GrimDark world it becomes a point that any minor characters can and will die.<br />* NoSenseOfPersonalSpace: Jir doesn&#039;t seem to considering his tenancy to hug people alot and randomly appear and take naps on peoples heads.<br />* NotAMorningPerson: Jir tends to get grumpy if you wake him up early or in the middle of his nap, basically waking up a sleepy Jir is not a good idea.<br />* NotAsYouKnowThem: When people first show up in the GD world they are often shocked to find people they known acting completly different then they do in the real world.<br />* NotOfThisEarth: only about 5% of the characters ARE of this earth.

<br />** If Melissa knows somebody has high blood sugar she&#039;ll make a joke about &quot;Their blood is good on pancakes&quot;.<br />*** If a grave must be used in an ImagineSpot it will always be Deef&#039;s or Alyssa&#039;s saying &quot;Nobody who matters will miss you&quot;

snapped and tried to kill the tallest.]]<br />[[spoiler:** Another example is Melissa whom was born sadistic from her hatchday but was also ridiculled by many she also had a voice in her head (A bit

FriendshipMoment: When Gar saved Melissa moments from death after she was captiured by Alyssa.<br />** When Deef went through embarassing hell to save Alyssa from Melissa and Gar [[spoiler: Although

some Deflecter sheilds are this, also Disguises that are more technollogical are this.<br />* HarmfulToTouch: All pure Irkens can&#039;t eat meat (Although some like Gar and Melissa find Earth Meats too delicious to resist) or touch water unless coted in paste, without screaming in pain and steaming.<br />* HandyRemoteControl: Greatest example would be the remote control Melissa used to painfully Shock Alyssa, whenever Deef tried to foil her plan for making Deef, her and Gar&#039;s temporary slave.<br />* HearingVoices: Melissa with Maria, Gar with anti Gar, both are the ??? flavor.<br />* HeroicBSOD: Wunny and GD Jir both got one of these once, probably the most notible example was when Gar had a nightmare of Gl.k killing her and she avoided him for a few days and was totally out of it.<br />* HighCollarOfDoom: Gl.k has one of these.<br />* HisStoryRepeatsItself: Riz&#039; (Jir&#039;s Riz) multiple appearence that cause him to almost win but ultimatley be defeated.<br />* HoldingBackthePhlebotinum: quite a bit, One good example is Jir who is a all powerful death mechine, but holds back his insane powers because he&#039;s somewhat cowardly and JUST TOO DANG NICE!<br />* HollywoodPersonalityDisorders: Melissa is a example of Sadistic Personality disorder, she even flat out admitted it to Deef. <br />** Also Gar has OCD (Because her creator also has it) even a personified version of it commonly known as Anti Gar.<br />* HorribleJudgeOfCharacter: Deef seems to believe Melissa is because of her refusal to agree that Gar is a idiot (Although she really isn&#039;t Deef&#039;s just a JERK!)<br />* IAteWhat: Melissa had a red drink and Deef asked what it was. She told him to drink it and find out. He thought it was koolaid, It [[OhCrap was]] [[ImAHumanitarian not koolaid]]<br />* ICantFeelMyLegs: Boo, Melissa&#039;s [[ShoutOut LEAST FAVORITE CREATION]], often states this despite never having legs in the first place.<br />* IKnowYoureinThereSomewhereFight: Jir gets this wherever he&#039;s reprogrammed. <br />* ImprobableAge: Deef and Alyssa are around 13 years old, yet they fight 130 year old aliens on a regular basis ([[JustifiedTrope Justified since 130 year old irkens are the equivalent of a 13 year old child]].<br />* InertialDampening: Jir gave Deef a berry that had this effect ,making him immune to interal affects of Irken food.<br />* InfiniteSupplies:You barely EVER see anyone at stores to buy things they should have run out of.<br />* InfraredXRayCamera: Deef and Melissa have one in thier goggles.<br />* InnocentAliens: Dorp and Zarn are this, they don&#039;t hate Earth Zarn&#039;s just hiding out there and Dorp doesn&#039;t want to leave because of Nel.<br />* IntergenerationalFriendship: Dorp and Nel. Nel is a 10-13 year old human while Dorp is technically 140 human years old (Although he&#039;s the equivilant to a 14 year old teenager on his planet so it may be [[JustifiedTrope justfied)]].<br />* InterspeciesFriendship: Any Irken-human friendships.<br />* InterspeciesRomance: Dorp (Irken) and Nel (Human).<br />* InvisibilityCloak: This is a world where NOT having one is weird.<br />* InvoluntaryShapeshifter: This was a idea that was somewhat discarded with Jir and only has a DayInTheLimelight every so often.<br />* ItsAllAboutMe: Gl.k is a very, very vain person as most irkens are, also Bunny used to be this.<br />* IWillPunishYourFriendForYourFailure: involved in one of Melissa&#039;s most elaborate plan.<br />* JerkassDissonance: Melissa is so Evil yet many people (except Deef and Alyssa) like her.<br />* JetPack: Sir units have this in their feet.<br />* KidsAreCruel: In a NoodleIncident with Melissa she was picked on quite a bit at the irken acadamy plus Kids on earth are no better. <br />** Most notably Nel who was majorly bullied at Skool.<br />* KillerRabbit: Wunny for obvious reasons.<br />* KillItWithWater: Deef and Alyssa will often douse Gar or Melissa in water.<br />* LackOfEmpathy: Interspeicies empathy does not exsist (Save for Nel).<br />* LeaningOnTheFourthWall: --&gt; Alyssa: This is just depressing. I feel like I&#039;m the creation of some sort of sick, twisted mind who hates me so much that they won&#039;t let me die, but suffer until the point I wish I could. <br />* LEGOGenetics: GD Nel specializes in this.<br />* LivingBattery: Irken Paks may be this since they don&#039;t need sleep (With exceptions like Melissa who&#039;s PAK is slightly defective and can&#039;t self-recharge like normal Paks).<br />* LonersAreFreaks: Deef and Alyssa are freaks in diffrent fields, Alyssa is a BeetleManiac and Deef is a ChildProdigy.<br />* MadeOfExplodium: Nano (Formerly) seems to be since everytime he is smart [[YourHeadASplode His head Asploads!]]<br />* MadeOfPhlebotinum:Might as well be with how 95% of the characters aren&#039;t from this world.<br />* MagicAntidote: Jir&#039;s berries are deffanly this.<br />* MagicFromTechnology: Alot of Irkens and sirs have magical abilities.<br />* MasculineGirlFeminineBoy: Buu (Girl) and Iro (Boy) <br />** Buu (XD Again) and Len (Boy). <br />*** Bunny (boy) Moosie (girl).<br />*** [[spoiler: Also Melissa thinks Alyssa and Deef are like this although she may just be taking a huge wack at Deef]]<br />* MeaningfulName: Gar&#039;s name is a combination of Gir and Gaz, Jir was the cutest male name ending in -ir, Melissa was named after her creator, Jay was named and based of of [[Literature/WarriorCats Jayfeather]], Riz (Jir)&#039;s creator was eating Rice while creating him, Micky was named after her creators friend Mickayla, Riley is Named after His/Her creator&#039;s friend Riley, Maria means bitter the list goes on.<br />* MentalPictureProjector: Gar&#039;s dream projector.<br />* MoodSwinger: Jay envokes this trope because he&#039;s a JerkWithAHeartOfGold.<br />* MoralMyopia: Fip tries to justify Melissa&#039;s potential drinking of human blood by saying &quot;at least it wasn&#039;t anyone you knew&quot;. <br />** All Irkens seem to think like this<br />* {{Nanomachines}}:Melissa&#039;s S.I.R Micky can turn into a nanobot so she will be unoticed when keeping tabs on people.<br />* NightmareFuelColoringBook: Melissa owns one of these, either used to draw nightmarish pictures of Deef and Alyssa being killed or [[spoiler:[[TearJerker Pictures of how alone and afraid she feels]].<br />* NobodyCanDie: In this universe dying is only PlayedForLaughs or PlayedForDrama. But in the GrimDark world it becomes a point that any minor characters can and will die.<br />* NoSenseOfPersonalSpace: Jir doesn&#039;t seem to considering his tenancy to hug people alot and randomly appear and take naps on peoples heads.<br />* NotAMorningPerson: Jir tends to get grumpy if you wake him up early or in the middle of his nap, basically waking up a sleepy Jir is not a good idea.<br />* NotAsYouKnowThem: When people first show up in the GD world they are often shocked to find people they known acting completly different then they do in the real world.<br />* NotOfThisEarth: only about 5% of the characters ARE of this earth. The latter being Dib, Deef, Alyssa and Nel.<br />* NotSoDifferent: Deef and Melissa, both are TheSmartGuy, DeadPanSnarker, loners and various other things.<br />* NoWaterProofingInTheFuture: Subverted since none of the charecters rust or at least that we know of.<br />* OminousWalk: Melissa loves to do this, almost everytime she encounters Deef or Alyssa she&#039;ll do this.<br />* OneSteveLimit: EVERYONE tries to keep to this.<br />* OOCIsSeriousBusiness:Ber being smart is taken very seriously, Jay crying is taken as a [[NotSoStoic very odd occurence]] and the list goes on.<br />* PastVictimShowcase: The boy Melissa killed to harvast his blood probably counts. <br />* PerpetualSmiler: San is this, save for a [[BreakTheCutie few exceptions]]. <br />* PhlebotinumBomb: Jir has missles that only hit a certain target and leaves everything else unharmed.<br />* PhlebotinumGirl: In the GrimDark world Com very well may become this if she makes a [[DealWithTheDevil Deal with Jir]] and joins [[TheDarkSide His alligence]].<br />* PhlebotinumInducedStupidity: Just one of the many implied security devices on Alyssa&#039;s containment unit.<br />* PinocchioNose: Melissa and Gar&#039;s eyes twitch when lieing about being human.<br />* PoisonIsEvil: Averted, Deef suspected Melissa poisened his food but Melissa claimed that would be most dishonourable, considering they were having tea and Melissa wanted it to be pleasant. <br />* PoliteVillainsRudeHeroes: Melissa can be polite, just not to Deef or Alyssa and Deef seems to be a jerk most of the time to irkens.<br />* ProtagonistJourneyToVillain: Road To Insanity the abandoned branch of the series was supposed to be a series about how Gar became who she is( although she&#039;s not exactly a villan), but was scrpped for time and explained in a single paragraph. <br />* PsychopathicManchild: Melissa and half the Irkens are very childlike and insane. <br />* PsychoticSmirk: Melissa&#039;s SlasherSmile is basically this with ScaryTeeth.<br />* PutTheLaughterInSlaughter: Melissa laughs alot [[spoiler: when attempting to harvest Deefs blood....]]<br />* QuintessentialBritishGentleman: Myk is made of this trope <br />* RapunzelHair: Nel&#039;s hair is down to her feet and is always perfectly straight. <br />* ReallyWasBornYesterday: Jir claims that he ages properlly and is simply a two year old, who has the intelligence of a teenager and the maturity of a toddler. <br />* ResentfulGuardian: Aparentlly every generation of rulers in the GrimDark world are this, most notibly Garth who straight out admitted it.<br />* RotatingProtagonist: This series is made by like 10 or more kids so it would be unfair to have a single protagonist. <br />* TheRunaway: Nel ran away from a abusive home and it was made into a episode of its own. <br />* RunningGag: If Melissa is ever seen drinking something it&#039;s described as &quot;[[ImAHumanitarian Red]] liquid/stuff&quot; <br />** If Melissa knows somebody has high blood sugar she&#039;ll make a joke about &quot;Their blood is good on pancakes&quot;.<br />*** If a grave must be used in an ImagineSpot it will always be Deef&#039;s or Alyssa&#039;s saying &quot;Nobody who matters will miss you&quot; or some variation.<br />*** Melissa+portal= &lt;3<br />*** Melissa and Gar&#039;s obsession with ham<br />*** Gl.k believing Melissa is a vortian spy<br />*** Melissa using british slang and Gl.k having no idea what it means.<br />* SanitySlippage: A GrimDark world princess (who&#039;s name escapes me) had this happent to her leading to her becoming AxCrazy. <br />** Also Gar and Melissa are notable.<br />* ScaryTeeth: Despite all irkens having zipper-like teeth Melissa is often drawn with sharp, pointed teeth when she&#039;s doing her SlasherSmile.<br />* [[spoiler:SelectiveSlaughter: Melissa would kill Alyssa and Deef in a heartbeat, but she won&#039;t due to certain things]]<br />* SelfDestructMechanism: Apperently all Irkens and S.I.R units are equipped with these incase their mission fails and they are found out by huge masses of the planets inhabitants.<br />* SentientPhlebotinum: GrimDark Jir may become one of these in some part of the GrimDark series.<br />* ShipperOnDeck: [[UpToEleven Zem tends to make flipnotes about how other peoples o.cs love her o.cs and have 5 children]] <br />* ShootTheDog:Everyone {{Squee}}s over Melissa when she becomes a baby, yet Alyssa was willing to kill her still (Luckily she lived)<br />* ShorterMeansSmarter: Played straight with Melissa whom is shorter then Ber and 10X smarter.([[TooDumbToLive Even that&#039;s a understatment]])<br />* ShouldntWeBeInSchoolRightNow: Replace We with you and you get an exact quote from the PlotHole {{Filler}} episode. <br />* ShoutOut: Jay is [[Literature/WarriorCats Jayfeather]] as a robot<br />** [[WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy &quot;Call a scientist!&quot;]]<br />*** Letty is named after [[VideoGame/{{Touhou}} Letty Whiterock]] (who ironicly is a ShoutOut herself), modeled after [[VideoGame/{{Touhou}} Youmu]] and has the {{Backstory}} of what Space Cores theorised Backstory is.<br />*** Alot Of the creator Jir&#039;s characters are a ShoutOut to something for example: Riley Italy(Hetalia), [[MamotteLollipop San]] and Wunny (Spliced).<br />*** &quot;That&#039;s why his blood is so good on pancakes&quot;(Futurama).<br />* SilenceYouFool: Everytime [[DumbAssHasAPoint Ber points out a flaw]] in what Melissa said this ensues.<br />* SlasherSmile: Melissa is proud of hers, (Evil giggle makes it even creepier).<br />* [[spoiler: SmallTownBoredom: Melissa believes this would happen without Deef and Alyssa]].<br />* SmugSnake: Melissa is this, doubled with his her PsychopathicManchild tendancies makes it seem like she&#039;s joking around with Deef sometimes.<br />* {{Squee}}: CutenessProximity always induces this. <br />* StepfordSmiler: San is this because she was picked on all the time, but Melissa told her [[ShoutOut if she just kept smiling things would get better]].<br />* StrappedToABomb: A character named [[AliensAreBastards Melissa]] enjoys joking with HeroAntagonist Alyssa, by... strapping bombs onto her.
