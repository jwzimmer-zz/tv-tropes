{"\nAround here a \"work\" can mean anything from a TV series to an individual movie or novel. What has a page varies, some books have their own pages and some are listed under a page for their entire series. Franchises are a bit different, only applying to multi-medium works and often reference other pages, but some works only have a page under the franchise namespace, serving as a refence the entire collection of works therein.\nAdvertisement:This is a limited index of some work indexes.
