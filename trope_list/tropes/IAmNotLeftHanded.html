</p><p>The situation varies from example to example. A common example is for a character to fight with their non-dominant hand, as in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">trope-naming example</a>, only to switch back to their dominant hand to gain an edge. Similar to this is pretending that they have a serious handicap, then deciding to stop the charade. It can also go so far as a character revealing that they have always had a superpower <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">which they now decide to exploit</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a> which they now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">have no option but to utilize</a>. The most common subversions are for the other character to also be not left-handed, or for the character to remark, "Yes I am," after he switches hands. (Or if the writer is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn">being subtle</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">doubling up</a> on this trope, that the character is later revealed as ambidextrous a.k.a <strong>"both-handed"</strong>.)

Much later, it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the tattoo was designed to prevent his magic from growing in power each and every time he uses it, as it would otherwise naturally do</span>. The reason is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's cursed to kill the first person he meets whose magic exceeds his own. Suppressing his magic only makes it more likely he'll run across someone stronger</span>.
<ul><li> Just as a reminder, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">without that limiter, Fay's magic can destroy an entire world/dimension/at least country when he has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPowerMeltdown">Super-Power Meltdown</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, when Jiraiya fights Pain: Jiraiya think he's won by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">defeating Pain's three bodies</span> then it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pain has <em>three more</em>, and one of them can repair the others.</span> Fittingly, he reveals this by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">ripping off Jiraiya's <em>left</em> arm.</span>
<ul><li> When Pain fights Naruto, he believes that Naruto has used sage mode long enough, and it will expire shortly. It does, but Naruto has got a couple more sage modes stocked up elsewhere. He also generates more sage mode <em>during</em> the battle, while Pain is busy lecturing him.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A, the Raikage, thinks he is still stronger than Bee when the latter challenges him to a Lariat strike. However, Bee reveals he has surpassed him, and completely overpowers him <em>without</em> his Hachibi Cloak</span>.
</li><li> Early in the series, most of the time Kakashi raises his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">headband</a> to reveal his Sharingan, he's saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">Let's Get Dangerous!</a>.
</li><li> Also Rock Lee's fight with Gaara. At first, even with his speed, Lee can't get past Gaara's sand defenses. Guy tells Lee that it's time to pull out all the stops, and Lee starts taking off the weights on his legs. No one else thinks this would make much difference, and Gaara's siblings find it outright laughable... and then the weights shake the whole arena and form significant craters when they hit the floor. It turns out they were <em>very</em> heavy. Lee then resumes his attack, even faster than before and able to hit Gaara so fast his sand shield can't move fast enough to block him. Is then revealed that Gaara has a sand armor beside his sand shield and Lee attacks have not done any significant damage. Lee proceeds to introduce him to his Eight Gates Technique.
</li><li> Naruto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em>, pretends to get badly beaten by Delta, in the hopes of she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustBetweenYouAndMe">revealing more information about her</a>. Delta however sees right through it and demands him to cut the charade and get serious with her.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>, it's revealed that Nanoha, Fate and Hayate voluntarily put limiters on their powers in order to continue working together, officially because of the office politics of having too high a concentration of power in one unit, but actually to disguise the true power available to Section Six, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">the reactions when the villains found out</a> just how well this worked were priceless. Nanoha also inverts this during the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">White Devil Incident</a>", purposefully powering down her weapon and using her weak hand to blast Teana into unconsciousness as part of a lesson.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.tsunamichannel.com/index.php?date=2003-09-19&amp;comic=ExCoKo">As does<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExperimentalComicKotone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExperimentalComicKotone">Experimental Comic Kotone</a></em>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> in that Konstantin <em>is</em> left-handed. This is actually a better ruse because 90% of the population is right-handed, no one would notice anything strange if a person was using their right hand.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>:
<ul><li> Karasu pretends that his power is to make anything he touches explode. Kurama tries to counter by fighting at a distance. But Karasu reveals that his real power is to make invisible bombs that he can move with his mind. <strong>BOOM</strong>.
</li><li> Younger Toguro gives us this gem after he's already powered up and begun dominating the fight with Yusuke.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Toguro</strong>: What I've been telling you is a hundred percent is really more like eighty-five. (powers up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even more</a>)
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> Volume 2, Train Heartnet reveals that he is not <em><strong>right</strong></em> handed. As a matter of fact, he was originally left-handed, learned to wield his pistol ambidextrously, and switches to his dominant hand to increase his fighting potential (i.e., speed and accuracy).
<ul><li> A similar example is Maki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateCrossBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateCrossBlade">Hayate × Blade</a></em>, who had always held her sword in her right hand until it was severely injured by her opponent. Another character explains that she had not been fighting with her full power previously, because the manner in which she was gripping the sword was completely different.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>, Ryoma plays his first match in canon with his right hand. He manages to upstage his opponent in this state, but eventually decides to reveal that he is not <strong>right</strong> handed, and completely crushes the terrified opponent. Ryoma is fond of confusing his opponents this way throughout the series.
<ul><li> This is probably the most prevalent in Ryoma's showdown against Yukimura in the finale of the OVA, where Ryoma almost gets out-dueled by the much-feared Yukimura, and falls to the ground exhausted, but suddenly wakes up in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> and out-duels Yukimura in reverse.
</li><li> Also, Inui purposely handicaps himself with heavy weights on his ankles, which he later removes to the shock of his opponent. He's not the only one who does so, either; the non-regular Arai also uses weights. As does every other character in the series in at least one match.
<ul><li> Tezuka, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as a first year, was already better than his sempais, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">he hid the fact that he was better, to not insult them</a>. When Tezuka's cover was blown, one of the sempais lost it and <em>hit him in the arm with his racket</em>, this being the source of his infamous injury.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This also happens in the second movie, Battle of the British City, where after Ryoma's reveal of being left-handed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Keith</span> also switches to his dominant left hand having been using his right hand for most of the match.
</li><li> Actually, this happens quite often, notable examples being in the manga.
<ul><li> During Kikumaru and Oishi's match against Rikkai's Niou and Yagyuu, it's revealed halfway through the match that Niou and Yagyuu have been imitating each other, and when they finally switched back to being themselves, their moves' power increase (helped by the fact that since Niou's dominant hand is his left, they've both been using their weaker hand up until the reveal).
</li><li> Also with Shiraishi in the New Prince of Tennis, where it's revealed during a match that the reason his left hand was wrapped in bandages was because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> underneath he was wearing a golden gauntlet.</span> With that taken off, the power and speed of his shots become impossibly high.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In chapter six of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombiePowder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZombiePowder">Zombie Powder</a></em>, It is revealed that Gamma purposely handicaps himself when he fights against women and children. At the time, Gamma was fighting an old man with the appearance of a child, and when he realized this, he began to fight seriously. And beat the mickey out of his opponent.
</li><li> Myojin pulls this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheLawOfUeki">The Law of Ueki</a></em>. Ueki thinks he's figured out how to beat him, then he reveals that unlike every other power user, he was given two special powers instead of just one.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>, when Casca first fights against Adon, she finds herself being driven back by him due to her having a period at the worst possible time. She is saved by Guts, and the next time she goes up against Adon afterwards, she starts to drive him back, telling him that she just wasn't feeling well last time, much to Adon's surprise.
</li><li> Characters on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a> Z</em>, whether hero or villain, tend to do this very frequently.
<ul><li> In their first match, Tien outmatched Goku, easily able to keep up with his speed. After taking a beating, Goku decides to fight seriously. Apparently, he has been holding back during the entire tournament so he won't kill anyone, but decides it's okay to use his full power against Tien since he's very strong. The fight continues with them being more evenly matched with Goku having the advantage.
</li><li> During the second Goku/Tien Shinhan match, both are about evenly matched until Goku stops and asks if he can take some of his clothes off. Tien obliges (it's apparently rather hot outside), and thinks nothing of it until Goku's undershirt lands on the floor with a heavy-sounding thud. Cue the weighted-clothing revelation and <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mangafox.com/manga/dragon_ball/v15/c009/last.html">Tien's subsequent humiliation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Even funnier, Goku was <em>still</em> holding back.
</li><li> Having reluctantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">teamed up</a> with Goku to stop Raditz, Piccolo gets ready for the fight by taking off his cape, revealing that it's actually weighted training gear. Goku gets a kick out of this — and takes off <em>his</em> weighted clothing.
</li><li> After taking a hard hit from second-form Frieza, Piccolo ditches his weighted cape and powers up to a higher level. This gives him the advantage until Frieza one-ups him by going to his third form.
</li><li> Goku tries this against Nappa, refusing to use the Kaio-ken and handily beats him. Then he tries to kill Gohan and Krillin, forcing Goku's hand.
</li><li> Frieza is the franchise's absolute worst offender: One of our heroes finally has Frieza's measure? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">He just transforms to a stronger form.</a> <em>Three times.</em> Later on, Goku is seemingly matching Frieza's strongest form - until Frieza reveals he's still not even using <em>half</em> his power. Goku assumes he's bluffing until Frieza goes up to 50% and starts kicking his ass all over again. Even after Goku turns Super Saiyan, Frieza has one more lengthy power-up sequence left as he goes all the way to 100%.
<ul><li> In Frieza's case, it's explained that he has difficulty controlling his true power and the transformations keep his power within manageable levels. This shows in Frieza rapidly burning out when he reaches 100% of his power.
</li><li> Of course, at one point in the fight (after assuming his final form) Frieza <em>intentionally</em> gives himself a handicap, offering to fight Goku without using his hands, and he actually does for a while. He was likely just showing off, and stops doing it when Goku seems to be fighting better.
</li><li> And he does it <em>again</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em>. It ends up Frieza never properly trained because he was such a natural prodigy, and by training for four months he can surpass Goku in raw power.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Frieza comes back to life, again, for the Tournament of Power he reveals to Goku that, during his time trapped in Hell, he has been focused on mental training. As such not only can he access his Golden Frieza form without burning himself out he can maintain his power at a much stronger rate then before.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Frieza's minion Zarbon likewise keeps a transformation in reserve. In his case, it's because his stronger form is ugly and Zarbon is vain.
</li><li> Goku vs Majin Vegeta becomes this in hindsight. Vegeta <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">sells his soul to Babidi</a> in order to get himself a power boost and when he fights Goku, it effectively ends in a draw. After Vegeta performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">try</a> to kill Majin Buu, it's revealed later on that Goku had unlocked Super Saiyan 3 and had been holding back against Majin Vegeta all along. When Vegeta finds out about this later, he doesn't take it well, seeing it as an insult that Goku didn't consider him worth using full power against.
</li><li> Played with in the fight between Gotenks and Super Buu. Piccolo assumes Gotenks really IS outmatched, panics, and traps them all in a pocket dimension. Gotenks then reveals that he was only pretending to be losing, and that he could secretly go Super Saiyan 3 all along. He was hiding it because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">he thought it would be more</a> entertaining. He uses his withheld Super Saiyan 3 transformation to rip the fabric of space-time, escape said pocket dimension, and kick Super Buu's ass for five minutes anyway.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Beerus</a> in his battle with Goku stated that Goku in his Super Saiyan God form matched 60% of his full power. <em>Super</em> later shows this is a <em>huge</em> lie, and Beerus was <em>holding back so hard the whole Universe 7 could feel it</em> if he went to full power. Just ask the main timeline's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Zamasu</a>. Oh yeah, you can't, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CessationOfExistence">deleted from existence</a> with Beerus doing so much as <em>extending his palm and saying "Destroy"</em>. That's right, Beerus can simply <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">wish people out of existence</a></em>, and the same can be said of <em>all other eleven Gods of Destruction</em>.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> when Goku ends up in a tournament alongside Frost, an alternate version of Frieza from a parallel universe. When Frost claims his third form is his strongest, Goku doesn't buy it and accuses him of keeping a transformation in reserve for later matches. Not only does he <em>know</em> what Frost's true form would look like, he's doing the same thing himself.
</li><li> The tendency to fight this way gives Goku and Pan serious trouble against Haze Shenron. Pan has no problem kicking around this pathetically weak opponent but it turns out that his pollution aura has been sapping their strength, thereby giving him the upper hand. After escaping his area of influence and regaining their strength the pair are able to return and easily destroy him with an energy blast. They should have just done that in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> Kenshiro tends to do this quite frequently to a worthy opponent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar">Fist of the North Star</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em>, Kagura pulls this on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Abuto</span>. They seemed a pretty equal match, until he has her pinned to the floor and helpless, but it turns out she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> wasn't fighting with her full power; she then goes full-on Yato on him and proceeds to give him a thorough thrashing</span>.
<ul><li> Not a conscious reveal so much as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Super-Powered Evil Side</a> triggered in response to Shinpachi almost being killed by Abuto. Shinpachi actually has to stop Kagura from killing Abuto, knowing that in her right mind she wouldn't want to.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>, Tieria is in control of Gundam Virtue, which is capable of transforming into Gundam Nadleeh. Whether Nadleeh is actually <em>more powerful</em> or not is a tricky question: Virtue definitely has the more powerful weapons attached to it, but Nadleeh possesses the TRIAL System, which allows it to completely shut down any Mobile Suit connected to VEDA instantly. Most of the most powerful Mobile Suits are connected to VEDA. Against normal opponents, Nadleeh is weaker than Virtue, but against any VEDA-enhanced machine, it's an "I Win" button. Their successor units, the Seravee and Seraphim act the same way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> Psychic duelist Akiza (Aki Izayoi in the original) has a hair braid that supposedly suppresses her powers (which is basically to make Duel Monsters and magic real); however, this may just be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather">Magic Feather</a>.
</li><li> Ryuho of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Scryed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Scryed">Scryed</a></em>, when, pressed by Kazuma, he reveals that his Alter, Zetsui, has a level of power previously unknown even to his closest allies.
<ul><li> It seems to be more of a justified <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> as their energy is drained a lot faster when using it. Also his allies knew about it, but it was stated that it had not used for the last two years.
</li></ul></li><li> Gou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Getter Robo Go</a></em> handicaps himself during a shot put event by only using his right hand. When he uses his left hand, he can throw the weight like a baseball.
</li><li> Used almost literally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MrFullswing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MrFullswing">Mr. Fullswing</a></em>, where ace pitcher Inukai claims to have been a softball player for most of his time in middle school and throws underhanded pitches with his right hand... until the final batter of the tryout game comes up, and he switches to his natural left-handed, baseball pitching style.
</li><li> Similar to the <em>Mr. Fullswing</em> example above, the antagonistic billiards player Ryoji in <em>Breakshot</em> is narrowly defeated by main character Chinmi in a exhibition match, and it's immediately revealed that Ryoji, who had been using his right hand against Chinmi, is actually left-handed and was going easy on him. When they meet again in the finals of the tournament, Ryoji reveals there's more to it than that; He actually <em>let</em> him win before.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em>, in the Greed Island arc, where Killua and Gon train with Biscuit Krüger who looks like their age, but isn't. Not only that but when she fights against an opponent while Killua and Gon aren't around, she turns into a huge muscley beast that is her "real form" and utterly obliterates the opposition. She's quite strong before this, so it isn't so much hiding her strength as it is she thinks the form is really ugly and doesn't want people to see it.
<ul><li> There is also Netero in the hunter exam, where he challenges <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">the boys</a> to a game where they have to snatch a ball from him before sunrise. Netero spends most of the challenge using only his left hand and right leg, in the end they try and succeed in forcing Netero to use the rest of his limbs after they knew for sure that they could chase him for a year and not catch that ball.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shamo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shamo">Shamo</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> Ryo Narushima spent most of all 5 rounds struggling to fight the heavyweight karate genius before a straight punch literally knocked some sense-inducing flashbacks into him, to which he switches to a southpaw stance, completely shocking the entire crowd.
<ul><li> It is also used as an explanation of why Ryo turned out the way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">he is</a>. Yes, folks - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASinisterClue">he's evil 'cause he's left-handed</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The entire Negi/Kotaro vs. Rakan/Kage fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>. The entire thing consists of the the opponents one-upping each other, to simply ludicrous levels. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Negi does it <em>five times</em> in a single chapter.</span>
<ul><li> Rakan later combines it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a>. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">disarmed</a>, dislegged, told he's a puppet, and shown that the Princess has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnotizeThePrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypnotizeThePrincess">been hypnotized</a>. He responds by putting on magical armor arms and legs and getting up for round 2.
<ul><li> You know what, just Rakan in general is this trope. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After he was finally defeated by Fate and dissolved by the Code of the Lifemaker, he re-materializes when Fate taunts Negi and then gives Fate a final epic punch and tells Negi to kick his ass before dissolving for real.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Happens also in the final fight of the Mahora Festival Arc. After destroying the main secret weapon of his opponent (and his own equivalent weapon gets destroyed in the meantime as well), Negi declares that now he has an advantage because he can use magic and his opponent cannot. Then suddenly his opponent reveals that she is pretty good at using magic in battle too. Of course, he should have expected this, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">descendant from the future</a> after all.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no Go</a></em>, a guy named Dake-san is called in by the proprietor of a Go salon to teach a lesson to a kid who's been cheating. He pretends to be a weak player at first, among other things by holding the stones poorly - with his right hand. His moment is when he reveals that he IS left-handed.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em>. Ryohei only uses his left arm in his fight with Lussuria until he needs to. This is because he was saving the energy in his right arm so he could use his Maximum Canon.
<ul><li> "Haha, too bad. I've only shown eighty percent of my power so far." "I've only shown half."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelicLayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelicLayer">Angelic Layer</a></em>, during Hikaru's fight with Shirahime, Shirahime takes off her kimono, increasing her already-amazing speed and turning the tide of the battle.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> football teams tend to do this by not allowing certain players to play until needed, as to make the enemy underestimate them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> While fighting Wrath in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">the manga</a>, Scar reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">during the three month break he has tattooed his right arm with his brother's reconstruction transmutation circle getting rid of his weakness that he could only deconstruct using alchemy</span>.
</li><li> Much earlier, Edward fought Slicer/Number 48 a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoxedCrook">Boxed Crook</a> turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedArmor">Animated Armor</a> who displays his blood seal on the back of his helmet during the fight. Ed then knocks the head off, knowing he couldn't control a body he wasn't connected to, but then it turns out "Slicer" was actually <em>two</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killers</a> (brothers), the other of which was put in the same armor, but the seal was on the torso. This is then Lampshaded after Ed beats him as well and he pokes the armor cautiously while asking if there was a third one. The older Slicer brother resignedly says no, it's just the two.
</li><li> When Ed fights Kimblee, he manages to screw up one of the half transmutations circles on Kimblee's hands and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">knock the Philosopher's Stone out of his hand</span> to prevent Kimblee from using any alchemy without wasting time drawing another circle, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kimblee had <em>another</em> stone hidden in his mouth (and had for literally years)</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">Explosions ensue</a>.
</li><li> It turns out Sloth hasn't been fighting with all his abilities because he's too lazy. When he gets badly pummeled by the Armstrong siblings, he remarks it's time to "go full throttle":
<div class="indent"><strong>Sloth</strong>: "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">I am the fastest Homunculus.</span>"
</div></li><li> In an extra chapter in the manga "The Military Festival" Ed and Mustang battle it out (or rather, Mustang shoots flames at Ed as Ed runs around dodging). Ed suckers Mustang close enough to rip off the transmutation circle on his glove when Mustang reveals that his left hand (which was in his pocket the whole time) also has a transmuting glove on it. So it's more like I Am Not Right-Handed. Later, during Mustang's fight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Envy</span>, it turns out to not be a gag when we see Mustang consistently using his left hand for pinpoint burning and his right hand for big explosions.
</li><li> Happens as early as the second episode in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime</a>. Ed opts to allow Cornello to think that it's the State Alchemist watch that lets him perform alchemy without a transmutation circle. Then, when the time comes to show otherwise, he bluntly tells Cornello "My skills don't come from a pocket watch!"
</li></ul></li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BakaAndTestSummonTheBeasts">Baka and Test: Summon the Beasts</a></em>, when Akihisa goes up against Miho Satou, an A class student, Akihisa declares himself to be left-handed, but winds up losing anyway, because it's a fight determined by <em>test scores</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, Aion gets badly beaten by Duke Daffau when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daffau attacks Aion's base, Eden</span>.

Cue him getting whupped. He then states loudly that he's going to have to take this seriously, whereupon he takes off his shirt, revealing that he was wearing a full body spring retainer thing. This being a tournament where people have been known to die, everyone, including the announcer, declares him insane.

<ul><li> In general, when the Evas go berserk, they tend to do things that didn't seem within their capabilities beforehand (regenerating arms, taking damage that would have destroyed them earlier, and in Rebuild, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shooting eye beams and triggering new impacts <em>by themselves</em>!</span>).

Most of the time, every threat he finds, he can trounce without putting an ounce of effort. And then the really powerful villains show up, start thrashing the entire league of superheroes, and he decides he'll get slightly serious about it. And <em>that</em> is when the near-apocalyptic punches start coming out. Woe betide anyone he actually has to punch <em>twice</em>.
</li><li> Characters from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em> tend to use that trope a lot.
<ul><li> In his first battle with Starjun, Toriko powered up mid-battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">and wiped the floor</a> his robotic avatar. Whoever, turned out that Starjun immensely stronger than Toriko and lost only because his super-powered robot body was <em>slowing him down</em>.
</li><li> Later in the story, Toriko pulled one on Starjun. After he used all his strongest attacks on him, which barely did any damage, it looked like he didnn't have a chance, until he revealed a new battle technique that basically allowed him to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">turn all his attacks into one-hit kills</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">make up new moves as battle go</a>.</span> It looked like Starjun didn't stand a chance, until he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying">managed to learn this technique, just by watching him</a>.</span>
</li><li> In one of the earlier fights, Coco and Toriko got into a really difficult fight with the Devil Serpent - a particularly nasty giant snake. After the battle was over, Toriko complained that he wouldn't be able to eat it, since Coco poisoned it. Coco replied that he knew that Toriko would want to eat it and purposely used a weaker poison that dissolves when exposed to heat, and if he had used an actually strong poison, the battle would be much easier.
</li><li> Sunny used this twice - in the fight with Cedre, he pretended to run out of stamina in order to get him in the range of attack, and in the fight with Tommyrod he struggled to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">remotely control strands of his hair, which were previously cut off by Tommyrod's bugs, accidentally giving the impression that he can't control his Satan hair, while in reality he already had full control over it.</span>
</li><li> Tommyrod himself looks like he constantly wears <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">bracelets which prevents his muscles from expanding</a>, considerably weakening him and making him look frail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldofMuscleMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldofMuscleMen">(especially by Toriko standards)</a>. If he deems his enemy " worthy ", he takes them off, revealing his real strength and his enormous muscles.
</li><li> Both Jirou and Mansam have special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">seals</a> which prevent them from using their full power because they considered to dangerous. They take off their seals and use they full power only in the most dire situations.
</li><li> Monkey king Bambina is the embodiment of this trope. Not only he never fights seriously (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he is just trying to dance, but due to his immense strength and speed, his partners end up ripped to shreds</span>), but his is body constantly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">covered in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">tight layer of skin and fur that restrains and weakens him</a>, and his true power gets unleashed only after he breaks out of it.</span>

<ul><li> He employs a predictable routine of attacking with his sword in his right hand and parrying with his scabbard in his left. Then, just as his opponent has become comfortable with this style, he'll switch his sword and scabbard <em>in mid-strike</em>, reversing his attacks and parries and thus revealing he's ambidextrous.
</li><li> His shikai manifests as a spear. Except it's not. It's really a three-section staff and it can slip between spear and staff at any stage, completely catching his opponents off guard and making his attacks unpredictable.
</li><li> He greatest secret is that he also possesses bankai. He keeps this secret out of fear that he'd be forced to leave the 11th division and become a captain of another squad. He'll even throw a fight if he can't get away with using it in secret.

</li></ul></li><li> Yumichika's zanpakutou initially transforms into a khopesh-shaped weapon. Then he reveals it can actually transform into a four-bladed sickle-sword, although it doesn't do anything more than give his opponents very nasty wounds. Finally, Yumichika reveals this is actually a fake shikai and his real shikai is arguably one of the most powerful zanpakutou in the entire manga, being able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyAbsorption">absorb the life energy</a> from anything it captures and then use that absorbed energy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiricDraining">heal Yumichika's wounds</a>.

The only reason he doesn't thrash people right and left with it is because it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">kidou-type</a> zanpakutou which is taboo in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">11th squad</a>. He'd therefore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonourBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonourBeforeReason">rather die</a> than have his squad learn the truth.
</li><li> Aizen deprives Yamamoto of his zanpakutou because of its reputation for being the most powerful offensive zanpakutou <em>ever</em>. Yamamoto promptly reveals Aizen's error by unleashing hell with his bare fists and some of the story's most powerful kidou attacks.
</li><li> Nnoitra's released form reveals four arms which even Kenpachi struggles to fight against. And then Nnoitra reveals he doesn't have four arms, after all. <em>He has six.</em>
</li><li> Kyōraku subverts this. His shikai is a tricky set of weaponized children's games that trap both him and his opponent in the rules of the game until one or the other is dead. The three games become something of a pattern for him, one that Starrk gets used to. Then he reveals he had a fourth game all along, one that allows him to <em>ambush strike through shadows</em>.
</li><li> When Uryuu and Mayuri fight, Mayuri believes he's resolved the fight quite quickly by paralysing Uryuu's body with poison. Uryuu reveals he possesses a Quincy technique that allows him to fight normally <em>even when his limbs are otherwise completely paralysed</em>.
</li><li> When fighting against Gantenbainne, Sado reveals the enormously powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">right arm</a> he's been fighting with throughout the manga is actually a defensive, shielding power. His real attack force is located in his left arm and is much more powerful than his right arm.
</li><li> When Soifon and Yoruichi fight, Soifon thinks she has the upper hand and proudly displays her ultimate technique which she's only just invented and mastered and hasn't even had time to name yet... then Yoruichi reveals that she knows all about the technique. She had developed, mastered, and named the technique decades ago and Soifon has in fact still got a long way to go before she comes even close to genuinely mastering the technique.
</li><li> Gin Ichimaru's bankai extends his sword to 13 kilometers length, and he demonstrates its power by slicing buildings in half with one long circular swing. But he then reveals that the true strength of the weapon is not its length, but how fast it can extend and retract (roughly 500 times the speed of sound), essentially acting as a sword-shaped railgun/machine gun. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And then, at a critical moment, he reveals it's not quite that long or fast. The true danger in the blade is that when it extends and retracts, it dissolves into a metallic powder that is left behind in the wounds it causes.

<ul><li> DC Comics icon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is prominently known for holding back all the time to avoid one-shotting his opponents' heads off as well as general collateral damage. When the gloves are off, however, fights tend to end quickly. Issue 669 explores this in depth (a flashback to his rookie years, when he had to be extra careful because humans are squishy). For what happens when Superman stops holding back, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">"World of Cardboard" Speech</a>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em>, Superman builds The Miracle Machine, which can grant one wish. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mandrakk</a> arrives and says he did that for nothing, as he has no power source great enough to activate it. Superman <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> unleashes the stored yellow sunlight within his own body, turning it on. He wishes for... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">a happy ending</a>. This simply ensures that the good guys will win this battle.</span>
<ul><li> Likewise, Mr. Tawky Tawny is involved in this crisis and the Tigerman leader he fights - Kalibak, the son of <em>Darkseid</em> - learns the hard way that while he may look like a wimp in his tweed business suit and bowtie, he is still a mighty <em>tiger!</em>
</li></ul></li><li> When he first encountered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatsSoFunnyAboutTruthJusticeAndTheAmericanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhatsSoFunnyAboutTruthJusticeAndTheAmericanWay">Manchester Black and The Elite</a>, he pulled off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> to show how scary he'd be if he ever really cut loose.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a></em>:
<ul><li> When DC brought Kara Zor-El back after her death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>, it was rumoured that she was more powerful than Superman. Then Superman proved that his cousin was not more powerful. She <em>seemed</em> more powerful because she hadn't learned yet how to hold back, unlike him, who is always holding back.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RedDaughterOfKrypton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/RedDaughterOfKrypton">Red Daughter of Krypton</a></em>, one dozen of Green and Red Lanterns manage to restrain a mad Supergirl. Afterwards, Kara reveals that she was holding back because she was scared of killing them all if she let loose. Guy believes her.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>:
<ul><li> Spidey, competitor Marvel's flagship character, does something similar to Superman, too, albeit at a much lower level; after all, Spidey collars ordinary crooks almost as often as he clashes with super-villains (and several of them still have only human-level toughness), and using his full strength to punch out a non-superpowered bank robber would end up rather messy. Often, he avoids this simply by webbing up normal guys rather than fighting them directly. A rare example of his actually taking the kid-gloves off occurred In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> when he was goaded by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheKingpin">The Kingpin</a></em>, someone who had always been considered a worthy match for him before — but not now. With nothing left to lose, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Spidey wiped the floor with him</a>, letting every witness (and there were <em>plenty</em>) know he could have done that <em>any</em> time he had wanted.
<ul><li> A "What If?" story showed he was <em>still</em> holding back: had he wanted he could have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">ripped Kingpin's heart without much effort</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is also further hit on by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> when his mind took over Spider-Man's body, as he noted in shock that he was surprised how much Parker had been holding back and pulling his punches all those years that they fought.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s fight with the Black Knight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelAdventures">Marvel Adventures</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> is cut short when the latter reveals his lance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">doubles as a</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>.
</li><li> In the "What If?" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a> special, Henry Gyrich creates an army of Thor clones to enforce registration. Reed Richards notes that Thor once told him that no matter how powerful a mortal is, he will only ever use a third of his strength for fear of killing them. The clones, of course, have no such restraint.
</li><li> When the <em>real</em> Thor comes back after Civil War, he confronts Tony Stark over what he did - with his hammer. When the lightning bolts start flying, Tony blasts him - to no effect. He tries the "old school" approach, and Thor sends him flying and near-cripples his armor with one hit. He says that Thor must have been working out, in shock at how hard he was hit. Thor replies that the only difference this time is that he isn't holding back.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered">Empowered</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Vol. 4: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Emp confronts Fleshmaster, a former hero who'd turned his powers against everyone at Capes' award banquet. Emp's suit had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothingDamage">shredded down to gloves</a>, rendering her naked and powerless. Fleshmaster gives her a quick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> speech (They were both considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkeys</a> of the hero community) and offers to spare Ninjette and Thug Boy... if Emp will give him a blow job. Emp goes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShutUpHannibal">Shut Up, Hannibal!</a>"... before revealing that she could turn her suit invisible at will. Cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>.</span>
</li><li> Syndablokk also does this earlier, when he and Emp were getting thoroughly thrashed by a villain, he shows that he has the ability to manipulate concrete, masonry, and pavement, but doesn't use it much because it could cause a lot of collateral damage and the aftereffects tend to linger.
</li></ul></li><li> Near the end run of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BirdsOfPrey">Birds of Prey</a>, the team moves their headquarters from Metropolis to Platinum Flats, which just happens to be the next town over from where former member Black Canary is now living. Of course, it ultimately results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsYouAndHimFight">Let's You and Him Fight</a> between Black Canary and current Bird of Prey member Manhunter. As they battle Manhunter prattles about her recent fights against other superheroes, explaining the successes she has had in sparring matches against the likes of Wonder Woman and is happy to finally have a chance to see how she compares against such a famed martial artist as the Canary. Eventually, she asks why Canary has not used her signature Canary Cry sonic attack. Canary says she "is trying really hard not to put [the Manhunter] in the hospital."
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">Flash: Rebirth</a></em> series (pictured), Superman is chasing after Barry Allen, when Superman begins talking about the races they've done in the past. Barry responds with "Those were for charity, Clark," and immediately speeds off, leaving Superman dumbfounded and far, far behind. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gbty');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gbty" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gbty');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Superman's speed used to be a match for Barry's but it had been retconned to be slower in the 25 years since their last race. </span>

If he's willing to take his visor off for even a few seconds, you're in trouble.
<ul><li> In <em>Astonishing X-Men</em>, the team are confronted by a Sentinel. They line up and talk tactics but Cyclops is in no mood for such things — he removes his glasses, and utterly <em>eradicates</em> the Sentinel from existence — as well as about a mile of forest around. Later in the same run, he had his powers psychically de-activated by Emma Frost and had been captured and tortured by an alien warlord. When he finally tells the warlord that the X-Men's secret weapon "Leviathan", was completely fictional (thus throwing out any reason to keep him alive), he starts laughing. The warlord attacks him, demanding to know what else he's been lying about. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then <a class="urllink" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Gd8NBIma-zo/RzSgt3KLuhI/AAAAAAAABm8/hjnXT6PbLlA/s1600-h/scottLies1.jpg">with the villain right up in his face,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Gd8NBIma-zo/RzSguHKLuiI/AAAAAAAABnE/VsI5SKYySOM/s1600-h/scottLies2.jpg">Cyclops reactivates his eyebeams and blasts the villain, leaving a massive hole in the building.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small></span>

Cyclops is being restrained by a Sentinel because it has figured out that he operates his optic blasts by pressing a button on the side of his visor. Scott then reveals that he can also do it by snapping his fingers.
</li></ul></li><li> One issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a></em> had Hercules telling a pompous tale about a fight with Thor. He was just getting to the point in his story of beating the daylights out of the thunder god when he learned that one of the young listeners was a <em>serious</em> Thor fan. So Hercules abruptly changed the ending to reveal that Thor had been holding back all along, and punched Hercules across the sky. "I landed in a place the gods forgot: New Jersey!"
</li><li> The last fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>: The Oath</em> is a fistfight between Strange and Nicodemus West, who also knows magic but has deployed some anti-magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">phlebotinum</a>, expecting he can take Strange in a fair fight.

However, during the final confrontation with Donald Pierce, Weapon X revealed that he had actually <em>retracted</em> his claws before he lost his hand, and promptly gutted Pierce with them.

Then Mickey <em>completes the quote</em> and switches hand too, before winning the duel.

</li><li> In a variation on this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourSuperpower">11th-Hour Superpower</a>, in chapter 75 of the first book, Jean Grey is pointedly informed by Doctor Strange just how powerful she really is.

He mocks her, saying that he remembers everything from his old self and knows that he always won whenever they duelled in the past. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't know that Twilight has been holding back ever since the traumatic day she gained her cutie mark and her power awakened, deliberately keeping her strength down for fear of hurting others. He also doesn't know that she's recently been having an inspirational talk with Rainbow Dash and Applejack, convincing her to trust her magic power and not fear it. She even cites Superman's "world of cardboard speech" before letting loose on the villain.

The Operative employs a paralyzing technique that he had used earlier in the film, punching Mal in a nerve cluster in the lower back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It is revealed that Mal had been injured in a battle, had that nerve cluster moved, and his weakness becomes his strength as he gets up and catches the Operative by surprise, overpowering him and winning.</span>

Like most of the characters in this movie, his powers are undercut by reality. It is even revealed that the urban legend of him lifting a city bus was more accurately described as him giving it a push...while it was in motion. He goes head to head in the final act against Casanova Frankenstein, but is quickly knocked aside by the flamboyant villain. Down and out and off-screen, we hear...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mr. Furious say "rage, taking over" - a line that he had said several times before but without much effect. Frankenstein dismisses him saying, "yah yah yah, we have heard this before."

This is actually a feint, as he immediately uses his free right hand to disarm his overconfident opponent. After that, the fight becomes a brutal display of how his extremely skilled opponent never bothered to train for situations where he would not actually have a weapon.

</li><li> <em>Cats Have No Lord</em> by Will Shetterly deliberately echoes the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em> trope, up until the "I'm not left-handed either," which is not true, but a ruse to distract the opponent so that sand can be thrown in his eyes.
</li><li> Happens literally in the second installment of the Toldi Trilogy, written by János Arany. The titular hero participates in a tournament for the sake of fighting but is not interested in claiming the prize (marrying the daughter of the host), so he agrees with a left-handed knight (who is in love with the girl in question) to impersonate him. During the final duel, he almost gives himself away when he switches hands because he can't handle his opponent while holding the sword in his left hand. The trope is inverted when he's eventually challenged by the same left-handed knight he impersonated, over a matter of honor and Toldi is unable to get an edge over him because he's not used to fighting left-handed opponents. He eventually defeats his rival using his left hand.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDaley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDaley">Brian Daley</a>'s <em>The Starfollowers of Coramonde</em> has a character named Brodur who uses his right hand in fencing while setting up a hustle bet, and insults his opponent by saying, more or less, "I could beat you, even left-handed."

He appears to be thoroughly beaten and remarks on how the heroes seem to have bested him when he suddenly swaps his sword to his left hand and proclaims, "I am not right-handed!" The exchange leading up to that moment is an almost word-for-word parody of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Litearture/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Litearture/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>.
</li><li> The Royal Manticoran Navy of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> series required their newly-built pod-laying Superdreadnoughts to do this in the run-up to their all-out offensive, in order to conceal the existence of the ship type and their revolutionary abilities from the enemy. The result was SD(P)'s performing at a fraction of their capability...and still annihilating enemy squadrons all by themselves.
<ul><li> <em>War Of Honor</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">shows what happens</a> when you reveal this too early: The Manticorans are forced back onto their heels by the Havenites unexpectedly pulling this, thanks to Admiral Shannon Foraker being a very busy girl during the Cease Fire. They reveal some devastatingly powerful new superweapons, but they are not ready to deploy them to the entire fleet yet. Realizing this, the Havenites send what is, at that point, the largest battle fleet in history in an all-or-nothing bid to crush the Manticoran homeworlds' defenses and force a surrender. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They fail, but not before over a million people on both side die in the battle.</span>
</li><li> This was also policy later when they found themselves in skirmishes against the Solarian League, to run the starship impeller drives at lower acceleration and fire from ranges that would only need two drives of their Multi-Drive Missiles rather than the range offered by the full three. This was, in significant part, to prevent the much larger Solarian League from realizing how badly outmatched they were in case the Manticorans couldn't prevent an all-out war.
</li><li> Unfortunately for the Manticorans, this was <em>also</em> the case for the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mesan Alignment Navy</span>, who managed to conceal their entire <em>existence</em> behind the front of the comically inept and corrupt Mesan Navy.

She's chosen to duel for Tortall's honor when a knight from Tusaine's delegation insults them; when he wound her in the right arm and presses for the kill, she switches her sword to her left hand and defeats him. This is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsSkill">Chekhov's Skill</a> from the first book when she was shown learning to fight left-handed after breaking her right.
</li><li> In Joel Rosenberg's <em>Not Exactly The Three Musketeers</em>, the main characters meet an elderly wizard who challenges them to an arm wrestling match to prove how powerful the illusions he's selling are. He seems to transform into a young, muscular man and beats them easily; it takes them a while to see through his con: he actually <em>is</em> young and brawny, but using an illusion to make himself look old.

He fights just barely well enough to keep from getting killed and takes the offensive just enough to keep his opponent from getting suspicious until he finally sees whatever it is he's been waiting for, at which point the fight is generally over within seconds.

But once she sufficiently injures Procopio's pride (among <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">other things</a>) he decides to start fighting <em>seriously</em> and it turns out that a pompous blowhard of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">archmage</a> is still an archmage, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamageAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplashDamageAbuse">there are plenty of things a sufficiently powerful wizard can do to kill you that don't involve directly hitting you with a spell</a>.

After that loss, however, the Minbari got serious and, even without mobilizing their reserves, they methodically occupied the whole Earth Alliance and destroyed EarthForce as they slowly but inexorably came for Earth to start the complete destruction of Mankind.
</li><li> Done by <em>EarthForce</em> during the conflict against the Ch'lonas, the Koulani, and Drazi raiders. It was not by choice, as the conflict happened at the same time as the Earth-Minbari War and what they used to hold the line was what they could spare from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">the desperate attempts to slow the Minbari down while they tried to evacuate the Sol System and the Inner Colonies</a>.

His bionically-augmented body lets him pass the tests easily, but the last test is to arm-wrestle the strongest men in the tribe. While his bionic right arm lets him beat all the challengers, the medicine man for the tribe won't accept his victory unless Steve beats him as well.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Can be invoked when battling in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> game. Whenever some boss, such as the champion, evil team leader, etc. sends out their last Pokémon as a last resort, as a general rule, it's usually the most powerful. Taken even further in generation six and onward, as mega evolution and primal reversion are introduced as game mechanics. A boss NPC can have their last Pokémon mega evolve, because why not? And an ancient Pokémon undergoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWasHisTrueForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWasHisTrueForm">primal</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">reversion</a> is actually returning it to the overpowered form it once was a long time ago.
<ul><li> This is always the case in your first fight with a Gym Leader. Their job is to test new trainers, not utterly crush them, so their initial team is scaled to where the player is expected to be, despite being explicitly the most powerful trainers in a region who aren't the Elite Four or the Champion. In games allowing rematches, they go all out in the rematch, using Pokémon of a <em>much</em> higher level and often Pokémon they didn't use in the initial battle.
</li></ul></li><li> In many shooting videogames, players are often limited to usually using a pistol or shotgun, due to lack of ammo for more powerful weapons. This often leads to them saving the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Demonic Spiders</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.
<ul><li> Which is usually built into the game's expected strategy. A good example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeCrisis3">Time Crisis 3</a></em>. The first stage gives you a grenade launcher with two rounds near the end. Experienced players will save it where the final boss, a giant tank turret, can be eliminated with just those two rounds. Less savvy players will use them in the trenches to clear out corners filled with enemies and have only the pistol left for the boss.
</li></ul></li><li> Same with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">Role Playing Games</a>, where players will just keep on using regular attacks on the regular mooks they encounter to save up items and MP, only to open the whole can of whoop-ass on stronger enemies.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em>. Sanger Zonvolt is best known for piloting a mech whose only weapon is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">the Type-3 Zankantou</a> and which uses a custom operating system that turns it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionCaptureMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotionCaptureMecha">Motion Capture Mecha</a>. In OG Gaiden, a villain tries to take advantage of this by disabling the Zankantou, only for Sanger to switch back to the default OS and kick his ass with the onboard weapon systems. The catch is that these weapons had never made any kind of in-game appearance before and had only been referred to via concept art in the artbooks for SRW Alpha 2 (where Daizengar made its first appearance). So it's less "I Am Not Left-Handed" and more "I <em>AM</em> Left-Handed, But I Can Kick Your Ass With My Right Hand Too".
</li><li> Nero does a form of this in his fight with Dante in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em>: he's been keeping his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilHand">Devil Bringer</a> hidden under the pretense that his arm is broken and he must carry it in a sling. He fights Dante for the majority of their first contact with his right arm hidden in the sling, and just when Dante has the upper hand and is about to run Nero through, he suddenly throws the sling off and blocks Dante's sword with his cursed arm, stopping Dante in his tracks.
<ul><li> Dante himself pulls this in the same game. The fight mentioned above works as the game's tutorial because Dante's not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustToyingWithThem">putting a whole lot of effort into it.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14l20');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14l20" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14l20');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He spends the first half of the scuffle causally evading or deflecting Nero's (read: the player's) attacks, and doesn't even bother with his usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a>.</span> The next time he and Nero clash, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlovesComeOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlovesComeOff">the kid gloves are gone</a> and it's considered by many to be the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">difficult fight in the game.</a>
</li><li> Vergil also does this in <em>3</em>. In the first fight against him, he stays in human form all the while. By the second fight, he pulls out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Devil Trigger</a> after you damage him enough. In the third and final fight, he gets to use an even more powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> on top of the previous one with deadly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretAIMoves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretAIMoves">Secret A.I. Moves</a>.
<ul><li> It should be noted about the Devil Trigger, that before 3 it is played up like Dante has never been able to access it, so after Vergil kicks his ass in a cutscene after the boss fight that it awakens Dante's own abilities. Sort of giving Dante his own "I Am Not Left-Handed". In fact, in all the games save for 2 and 4 Devil Trigger isn't attained until a certain point so it's always been a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> technically.
</li><li> In the first game, the default sword Force Edge is it's own "I Am Not Left-Handed", in the fact it doesn't have a Devil Trigger form for Dante, and not until the right moment releases its true power to become the sword Sparda, which lets Dante Devil Trigger into his father's Demon Form.

Players using their companions as pack mules must take care to never give one both the weapon and the ammunition to carry at the same time, lest they find their sidekick firing your carefully hoarded and expensive missiles against molerats.
</li><li> <em>Fallout New Vegas</em> when playing with the GRA DLC installed active encourages the player to be left-handed. Part of this DLC adds a series of Challenges that often require the player to kill powerful enemies with horribly unsuitable weaponry, i.e. killing 5 adult Deathclaws using the absolute weakest weapons in the game, or killing 10 of the extremely quick and erratic Cazadores using explosives that have a long fuse timer before detonating. While the savvy player will realize that only the killing blow needs to be delivered with the required weapon, and hence soften up the target with something more sensible first, most of these Challenges are still excellent ways to discover when the player last made an autosave.

The extreme effectiveness of doing this was carried over from the previous game, <em>Jedi Outcast</em>. The Strong style is actually only useful for this in lightsaber fights, ending a battle or knocking the enemy's lightsaber out of their hands (or both).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AsurasWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AsurasWrath">Asura's Wrath</a></em>, half-way through the fight with Augus, he relishes the fact that Asura is putting up a decent challenge and takes out his sword Wailing Dark, proclaiming that not even the finest wine or the fairest maiden excites him as much as using his blade. The game then cuts to Yasha and Deus, who senses this and notes that Augus has only ever used his sword once before, and that was with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Deus</a> himself.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>:
<ul><li> The moment when Flash surpasses any speed ever achieved by a human being in order to whup Brainiac-Luthor's ass in the <em>Unlimited</em> episode "Divided We Fall". The episode practically gave the character an immediate boost from the goofy, comic relief of the League to an absolute badass in <em>a few seconds</em>. And to show how serious he was, we learn that going that deep into the Speed Force runs the risk <em>of not coming back</em>.
</li><li> At various times it is made very clear that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>, much like Superman, can cause <em>a lot</em> of collateral damage if he isn't careful. As for the above example, it's implied that he was approaching the speed of light and you can see cars flipping and distant windows shattering just from how fast he is moving. He outright doesn't use his ability to phase through solid material, because it can cause explosions or instant destruction.
</li><li> Superman lets himself get beaten up a lot because of this; he will fight using all of his powers, and he's beaten many times, but either because somebody broke out the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KryptoniteFactor">kryptonite</a> or because he's holding back early on and for some reason can't go back to being right-handed. Case in point: when he unknowingly fights Wonder Woman, he has to stop fighting, period, once he realizes it's her and is badly beaten up because of that. However, he frequently talks about the reasons he does this. At one point, he says that every hit he takes is one less hit his teammates has to. This especially comes to proof when Superman fights Darkseid in the series finale. After getting beat down, Superman gives his famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfCardboardSpeech">"World of Cardboard" Speech</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Superman:</strong> I feel like I live in a world made of <em>cardboard</em>. Always taking constant care not to break something, to break someone. Never allowing myself to lose control even for a moment, or someone could <em>die</em>. But you can take it, can'tcha, big man? What we have here is a rare opportunity for me to cut loose and show you just how powerful I really am.
</div></li><li> He then turns the tables and lets loose on Darkseid, knowing that he won't be killed right off, and easily kicks Darkseid's ass, sending him flying through several buildings to the other side of the city and then bashing him back down to the ground. Unfortunately, Darkseid then does this as well. Realizing he's outmatched physically, he switches to his technological superiority <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegatedMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegatedMomentOfAwesome">and instantly defeats Superman.</a>

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RafaelNadal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RafaelNadal">Rafael Nadal</a>, a 19-time Grand Slam champion in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a>, is right-handed, but he learned to play left-handed for purely strategic reasons; there are not too many lefties in tennis so opponents can find it difficult to adjust to playing against. In particular, it helped him become the only player to consistently beat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RogerFederer">Roger Federer</a> (arguably the greatest player of all time) because Federer's one-handed backhand is vulnerable to Nadal's lefty forehand.
</li><li> In a boxing match on November 4, 1947, left-handed fighter Mike Collins emerged from his corner in a right-handed stance and then shifted into a left-handed stance, flooring his opponent and winning the match in four seconds.
</li><li> It's common knowledge that professional wrestling is largely a staged fight but what <em>isn't</em> common knowledge is that a large part of the training is learning how to hold back so as to <em>not</em> seriously injure the opponent, and for the wrestlers to willingly cooperate in order to reduce injury. In essence, every match has the wrestlers fighting "left-handed". While professional wrestling moves are meant more for show than for actual practical application, often telegraphing most severely, it's safe to say that if some of those moves were performed in earnest, they would hurt. <em>A lot.</em>
<ul><li> To further illustrate this point, a lot of old school wrestlers-turned-trainers (such as Stu Hart) were legit amateur wrestlers and made a point of training their students to really wrestle and grapple fight.
</li></ul></li><li> Billiards and particularly snooker players sometimes switch hands to avoid awkward stretching across the table; some even actively train to become near-ambidextrous. However, only superstar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Ronnie O'Sullivan</a> will sometimes play entire frames left-handed just to mess with his opponent's head. Opinions differ on whether this is pure awesome or just jerkassery. O'Sullivan once received a formal complaint about being disrespectful after playing left-handed. In response, he claimed that he could play left-handed better than his opponent could play right-handed. He wasn't disciplined because he proceeded to play three games in a row against a professional, left-handed, and won all three.
</li><li> Many left-handed people will have found themselves in situations where the opposite applies. For whatever reason you will be forced to do something with your right hand and because of this will generally be pretty bad at it, but then when you get the chance to use your left hand you will surprise everyone at how much better you are. A common example is using something designed for right-handed people, then switching to something that can be used by either hand.
</li><li> A famous example is the "Rumble in the Jungle" fight between heavyweight boxers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> and George Foreman. While everyone knows the story now, back then, people had no idea Ali was intentionally holding back and letting Foreman pound him on the ropes. He told everybody who would listen that he was going to dance and make Foreman look silly, but he was bluffing. He knew Foreman was too powerful to stick and move because all it would take was one good shot by the big man to seriously hurt him. So he laid on the ropes until Foreman punched himself into exhaustion, then he knocked him out. Ali, afterwards, called the tactic the "rope-a-dope".
</li><li> Justified in the case of Károly Takács, an Olympic pistol shooter. He was already a world-class marksman when he suffered injuries to his right hand whilst handling a faulty grenade, whilst serving in the Hungarian Army. Determined to continue his shooting career, however, he trained using his left hand and eventually went on to win two gold medals in the 1948 and 1952 Olympic Games.
</li><li> A similar case to this is the pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in World War I, but continued his pianist career by commissioning works for the left hand alone by many prominent composers of the day, most notably Maurice Ravel's <em>Piano Concerto for the Left Hand</em>.
</li><li> Also <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5Y460dZtGY">this talent show performance.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Common when nations with a superior technologically advanced military attack a nation with an inferior and primitive military to keep civilian casualties low or avoid total destruction of the country's limited infrastructure. Sometimes an objective becomes so important to neutralize that they unleash their full might to achieve it (innocent bystanders and collateral damage be damned), showing they could actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">annihilate everything if they really wanted to</a>. Moreover, they never seriously consider using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">Nuke 'em</a> to just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">end the conflict in 15 minutes</a>.
</li><li> Used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cricket">Cricket</a>. While a batsman's handedness is usually known to everyone by the time they get to top level, sufficiently nimble ones can switch stances while the bowler is in mid-bowl (mid-pitch). Since players on the field in cricket are positioned asymmetrically, this completely throws off the attempted formation.
</li><li> Golf, a sport in which left-handed play is pretty rare at the top level, has some illustrations of this trope.
<ul><li> Played straight by Phil Mickelson, probably the most successful left-handed player in history; in golf circles, if you make a reference to "Lefty", everyone knows you're talking about him. Mickelson does <em>everything else</em> right-handed — he learned to play golf as a child by mirroring what his father did while facing him; his father played right-handed.
</li><li> An inversion: All-time great Ben Hogan was actually left-handed, but played right-handed.
</li><li> Both played straight and averted by 2003 Masters champion Mike Weir. Like Mickelson, he's a natural righty but learned to play golf as a lefty. In Weir's case, it was largely because he was a left-handed shot in his first sport of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IceHockey">(ice) hockey</a> (he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada">Canadian</a>).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3gb2b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3gb2b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3gb2b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Handedness in ice hockey is based on the side from which a player normally shoots. Most Canada-trained players are taught to play with their dominant hand on top of the stick, meaning that forehand shots will come from the side opposite their dominant hand. This is thought to be the main reason why left-handed golf play is much more common in Canada than in almost any other country.</span> While he enjoyed considerable junior golf success as a lefty, he had people telling him that he might be an even better player if he switched to right-handed play. He decided to write a letter to a pretty well-known golfer whom he had met at an exhibition when he was 11... none other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackNicklaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JackNicklaus">Jack Nicklaus</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">The Golden Bear</a> quickly wrote back, telling Weir that if he felt comfortable playing left-handed, he should stick with it. Weir plays left-handed to this day.
</li></ul></li><li> As part of a prank, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3FZLTpJREY">a nerdy girl asked two new Muay Thai trainers at a gym to spar with her<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. She goes a few rounds letting them think she's an unskilled newbie before proceeding to school them since that nerdy girl is actually Germaine Yeap, a professional Muay Thai fighter.
</li><li> Michael Vick, considered one of the most athletic quarterbacks in the history of the NFL, and one of the biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">What Could Have Beens</a>, throws left-handed, despite being right-handed. He was so good as a child, the neighborhood kids made him throw with his left hand, and it stuck.
</li><li> This is a common strategy used by chess hustlers. They'll play a few games with someone with no money at stake, and play deliberately poorly to make the opponent think they're weak. Then they'll get them to make a bet on the next game, and start playing for real.
</li><li> On a broader sense, few military powers respond with the full strength of their arsenal to threats anymore, least of all the nuclear ones. The reason is that doing so would result in a lot of neutral civilian casualties. Perhaps one of the greatest illustrations of this trope comes from Fallujah when over a hundred insurgents barricaded themselves in a booby-trapped three-story apartment building. The US Army's response was to simply blow the whole thing up using a single tank since there was no risk to civilians. In less than an hour, all the insurgents were dead with no other casualties.
