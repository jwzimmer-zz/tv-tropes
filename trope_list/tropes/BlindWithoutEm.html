Almost all TV characters with glasses have such bad vision that if they are deprived of their spectacles, they are practically blind — usually hammered home by showing (briefly) the character's uselessly blurry point of view or the character making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindMistake">Blind Mistake</a>.
</p><p>In animation, when such a character's glasses are lost, their eyes usually shrink down to pinpoints, which indicates either that they are squinting to see, or to point out the jarring real life effect of seeing someone who has huge eyes when seen through heavily magnified glasses without their glasses. An anime variation on this is usually represented with the character's eyes being replaced by 3's or <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emoticon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Emoticon">3_3</a></strong>, which is another stylization of squinting.

</p><p>Note: because special lenses are needed to keep eyeglasses from flashing stage lights, and reflecting filming equipment, any time an actor wears glasses, it's a character choice, and the glasses are special stage glasses, which the actor may or may not need. If an actor needs corrective lenses, and it's deemed wrong for the character, the actor has to do without, or wear contacts.

There's even a short dedicated to it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>: In a series where the majority of glasses-wearing characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGlasses">don't need them</a> for vision problems, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Estonia</a> is a notable exception, as character notes mention his poor eyesight without them. As he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodNerd">Hollywood Nerd</a> with a penchant for computers, it could overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses">Nerd Glasses</a>. They also help conceal his expressions, as he's said to always have a lot on his mind.
</li><li> Hida Sayuri in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BestStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BestStudentCouncil">Best Student Council</a></em> has a habit of having her glasses ("megane" in Japanese) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedGlasses">knocked off</a> so that she can meander about the ground mumbling "megane... megane...". Surprisingly, they have only been stepped on once. She's not just blind without 'em; she seems to lose all sense-abilities and tunes out the world completely when she loses them. The first episode alone has her apparently patting the same square foot of land saying "megane... megane..." for hours before being fireman-carried home, still in her <strong>orz</strong> state.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Black Butler</a></em>:
<ul><li> Maylene the maid is so farsighted she doesn't need a sight on her sniper rifles. However, that makes ordinary tasks as a housemaid rather difficult. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm">Blind Without 'Em</a>, barely functioning with 'em.
</li><li> This is also true of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Grim Reapers</a>. The "Story of Will the Reaper" OVA shows the workshop of the craftsman who makes all of their spectacles — he is a highly respected legend. The Shinigami Haken Kyoukai Theme Song from the second musical says that their #1 rule is that all reapers must wear glasses. In regards to actually seeing them fumble around for a dropped pair, the stoic, straight-edged William gets that sort of scene the most. About thirteen minutes into <a class="urllink" href="http://www4.funimation.com/video/?page=video&amp;v=6172:">episode 9 of Kuroshitsuji II<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, he loses his glasses and starts fumbling around on the ground Velma-styleeven admonishing a brick wall that he thinks is his partner. It also happens to a lesser extent in the aforementioned OVA.
</li></ul></li><li> Riruka Dokugamine from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>. She refuses to wear her glasses due to vanity. Actually downplayed: her nearsightedness is brought up only once, in a dark room when Ginjo refuses to turn the lights on, and she shows no obvious signs of needing glasses at any other point.
</li><li> Uniquely zigzagged in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrigadoonMarinAndMelan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrigadoonMarinAndMelan">Brigadoon: Marin and Melan</a></em>. Marin is a rare example of a character who's far-sighted rather than near-sighted. She does need glasses, but she can see well enough to get around without 'em. The trope later gets exaggerated halfway through the series; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marin becomes <em>literally</em> blind and can only see with a Monomakia acting as her glasses.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CandyCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CandyCandy">Candy Candy</a></em>: Both Patty and Stear. One adorably hilarious scene has both of them losing their glasses during a ball and trying to dance without them on anyway.
</li><li> Normally averted yet still invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> to maintain Conan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">Clark Kenting</a>. He doesn't need the glasses to see, but he fakes this anyway to keep his identity secret. The dub made it one step further by making him say he has retinitis pigmentosa.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisappearanceOfNagatoYukiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisappearanceOfNagatoYukiChan">The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan</a></em>: While this isn't a problem for her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi</a></em> self, the alternate universe Yuki Nagato very much suffers from this, to the point where she can't make out Haruhi on first meeting her from a few feet away.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrStone">Dr. Stone</a></em>:
<ul><li> Suika has terrible vision in the equivalent of the Stone Age, so glasses aren't exactly an option. Instead, she uses a helmet with peepholes to help get around this, though she doesn't understand why it works. As a result, whenever she takes the helmet off, she squints so hard that her head shrivels up like a raisin. Senku later manages to fashion some lenses for her helmet that act as glasses.
</li><li> It's later revealed that Kinro's vision isn't the greatest either, which hampers his ability as a warrior. When he borrows Suika's helmet during a fight, he immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Takes a Level in Badass</a> due to actually being able to see his opponent clearly. Senku later makes proper wire-frame glasses for Kinro, although Suika still prefers to keep using her helmet.
</li></ul></li><li> Issei Tsubaki in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em>, while still being functional without his coke bottles, doesn't recognize either Sōsuke nor Kaname without them, and it leads him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegatonPunch">almost kill</a> the janitor after going through the entire class just to find Sōsuke who had missed their duel on the roof.
</li><li> Sacchan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> has a tendency to lose her glasses often, leading to such situations as poking Gintoki's eye out with a chopstick full of natto or mistaking a time bomb for a giant <em>breath mint</em>. What makes her plight all the more disastrous — or hilarious — is that she's actually a ninja.
</li><li> Nowy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlassFleet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GlassFleet">Glass Fleet</a></em> is apparently blind without 'em, given that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedGlasses">Dropped Glasses</a> moments are frequent enough to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">Overly Long Gag</a> — but a scene near the end of the series suggests that he may be intentionally exaggerating it for Eimer's amusement.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaNoMizoShiru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HanaNoMizoShiru">Hana no Mizo Shiru</a></em>: Arikawa has <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dm5.com/m104613-p25/">terrible vision<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> without glasses or contacts.
</li><li> Integra Hellsing from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>, in the anime at least, is shown at a couple of points to have extremely poor eyesight without her glasses.

(The reason she wasn't wearing them in the first place was because the steam was fogging them up, so the benefits of putting them on again are unclear.)

He fails to recognize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">his dressed-up sister</a>, and she fails to recognize him without her glasses or contacts (and he has a slight sore throat, which changes his voice), and they end up on a date together. (It makes sense in context and isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squicky</a> in the least.) In the manga story he's just being nice to a sweet girl he's met, but in the anime he <em>does</em> finally recognize her and treats her to the memorable day she wanted to have — with Manami never realizing that this kind, gentlemanly boy she spends the day with was in fact her brother.

In Naru's case, most of the time she wears contacts. It's only when she's studying or, in the case mentioned above, running away from home that she puts on her glasses in lieu of the contacts. The only times when she has neither are in the bath or when her glasses are broken. The time running away from home, she said that she spent the entire night crying.

He can't see at all without his coke-bottle spectacles; that's why he summoned the team of scientists to his island, because he needed to use a microscope to perfect his shrinking device, and couldn't use one while wearing them. His miniaturized victims try to take advantage of this by breaking them. They only manage to break one lens, but that blinds him enough for them to trick him into chasing them to a mineshaft, where he plummets to his death.

This leads to scenes like pretending to read a book, which she's holding upside down.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MajorLeague">Major League</a></em>: Pitcher Ricky Vaughn can't make out the strike zone until he's fitted with an embarrassing pair of glasses.

When Mr. Burns' glasses get broken in the tunnel, he must feel his way in the dark. He sees the mummy ahead of him, but his eyesight is so bad he's not sure he sees anything. He looks away, then back, only to be sure that someone/something was there because it's now gone. The mummy appears right behind him, so now he can see the mummy up close.

When the Ripper knocks him down, he loses his glasses. Upon awakening, he can only view the surrounding events as a blur, and is easy prey for the Ripper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SororityBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SororityBoys">Sorority Boys</a></em> contains what is probably the stupidest example of this trope ever. It's a drag comedy that expects us to believe that a character without her glasses can't tell the difference between a naked man and a naked woman.

He nonetheless passes the NASA eyesight test by memorizing the letters: "I may be blind, but I have a perfect memory!"
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy">Spider-Man Trilogy</a></em>. Pete before getting his powers, and when they start failing.

The actress, Casey Rogers (billed as Laura Elliott), didn't need glasses, and couldn't see at all with the costume glasses on. She wears the thick lenses for close-up and medium scenes, and plain lenses for long shots, but there are still several scenes where she has to depend on other people to make sure she doesn't trip or stumble when she's wearing the glasses. In the scenes where Miriam goes to the amusement park with two men, she is holding both their arms most of the time because she can't see where she is going.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrawDogs2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrawDogs2011">Straw Dogs (2011)</a></em>: the male protagonist, although it's done poorly and not even referenced until his glasses are knocked off during the climax.
</li><li> Played for drama in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SummerCampNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SummerCampNightmare">Summer Camp Nightmare</a></em>, as when Donald Poultry drops his glasses into the ravine when he is forced to go across the rope bridge and Franklin has Stanley cut the bridge, causing Donald to hang onto the rope for dear life as the glasses drop and his vision is severely affected.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurkeyShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurkeyShoot">Turkey Shoot</a></em> has a particularly glaring example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBrute">Ritter</a> removes one prisoners glasses before setting him out on the field.

Anyway, at first, the image is very blurry (they can see someone who's obviously General McGrath, but not a paper he's holding) until West notices the victim's glasses on the table and puts them over his eyes. Then they can see the document clearly.

</li><li> While we know that she's nearsighted, in one story, <em>White Cane</em>, we find out Doki's myopia is pretty severe and that she can't navigate herself without her glasses, as the blurry images blend together and she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeripheralVision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPeripheralVision">no peripheral vision</a>, so, without her glasses, she carries a white cane.

</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a> doesn't have his glasses on, his eyesight is quite blurry and poor. This also applies to the books, most notably <em>Arthur's Eyes</em>, which was the title where Arthur gets his glasses (adapted into the first episode of the TV series as well.)
<ul><li> This is also discussed in the Step-Into-Reading book "Glasses For D.W.," where D.W. wants glasses like Arthur despite her eyesight being fine, though Arthur explains that he needs his glasses to see. D.W. soon begins to fake vision problems as an attempt to try and get glasses, to the point of intentionally walking into walls.

</li><li> Noelle as well. In one episode she loses them in a bet to another girl. While we are given a glimpse of her vision (in the perspective of the other girl when she puts on the glasses) it doesn't appear to be too bad. Until she gets her glasses back however, Noelle clearly has a difficult time seeing.

He accidentally broke his glasses and has to go out for a while without wearing them while they're getting repaired. He, however, has no problem going out in the town and immediately recognizes Daniel and the fact that he's not wearing his red sweater. It becomes more clear exactly how his vision is being affected only when Daniel plays dress-up with a brown hat, which Wednesday describes as a "fuzzy brown blob."

The resulting effects: Zilly sees everything upside down, Klunk sees everything in fours, and Muttley sees everything as far away. The General's hand reaches out from Dastardly's phone and plops a pair of glasses on him, with the result of seeing everything way close up.

<ul><li> The character Hallie the hippo makes this statement, as the titular Doc takes away her glasses supposedly to give her an eye exam, but actually to hide the fact that she's in a room that's decorated for a surprise birthday party (but isn't quite ready yet). We are, however, given a point-of-view shot of what Hallie sees and it's clear that things are just blurry, like someone with nearsightedness. She probably could have figured it out if Doc and the others hadn't continued to keep her distracted.
</li><li> Also, in the episode <em>Starry, Starry Night</em>, Aurora the telescope is blind without her eyepiece, mistaking the aquarium for a big-screen TV, Lambie for a dog and Chilly for Stuffy, who she thinks is a porcupine. As in the case of Hallie, this is reinforced with point-of-view shots, which indeed shows what she sees as a blurry mess.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DragonTales">Dragon Tales</a></em>, while the point-of-view shots show fuzzy nearsightedness, Eunice the unicorn (a flying unicorn, or alicorn, actually) is apparently so blind without her glasses that when Max and Emmy arrive, she addresses dragonberry bushes before turning to them. Then, when she actually sees Max, she thinks at first that he's a dragon and not a human.

His eyes don't shrink to points when he removes his glasses — <em>he doesn't have eyes without them.</em> Or eyelids and eyebrows, for that matter. Not only that, but they sit far down his face even normally, so you can see the blank stretch of forehead where they <em>should</em> be even when he's got the glasses on. Furthermore, as Cornfed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">suddenly notices and remarks on</a>, Duckman doesn't even have ears to keep his glasses in place. A particularly bizarre sight gag shows Duckman face down on the floor, his glasses knocked off, and his eyes <em>within his glasses</em> blink and shed tears. In one episode he actually removes the glasses/eyes, and turns them around to take a look at himself.

<ul><li> Everyone's individual prescription differs, but one constant is people with decent vision's impression of blind without 'em. For most people, having your glasses off is just blurry, but not necessarily to the point they can't operate in general. While walking down the street a person without their glasses may not be able to read "stop" on a stop sign, but they can see the big, blurry red thing and can tell they're at an intersection, so the fact that it's a stop sign isn't much of a logical leap. The blurriness is just like an out-of-focus camera, only it's stereoscopic — some blurs are closer than others.
<ul><li> Nearsightedness (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia">Myopia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) is when you can focus on things that are close to you, but the farther away things are the more blurry they become. This is the most common reason for vision correction.
</li><li> Farsightedness (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperopia">Hyperopia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) is when you can't focus on things right in front of your face — but your <em>distance</em> vision is clear. This is more rare than nearsightedness.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism_%28eye%29">Astigmatism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a defect in the shape of the lens or cornea that prevents a sharp image from being projected on the retina, making vision blurry regardless of distance - although they may also have a 'sweet spot' where everything is clear. The unusual shape of their eyeball also makes it very difficult to prescribe contact lenses for them.
</li></ul></li><li> That said, while you may be able to function to some extent without your glasses, actually <em>finding</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedGlasses">dropped glasses</a> can very easily invoke this trope. They're small, often dark-coloured, and blend in with so many things. Many people who have very bad eyesight without their glasses try to keep a spare or old pair in a drawer where they can be easily found to expedite finding their lost current pair of glasses.
</li><li> It's very common for people to have different vision levels in each eye. In extreme instances, the brain will respond by ignoring the signal from the weaker eye, resulting in functional blindness in one eye.
</li><li> One of the tests required to obtain a driver's license in practically every jurisdiction is a vision test. If you require the use of glasses or contact lenses to pass the test, your license will make note of that fact (usually with a code appended to your license number, or a printed endorsement on the license stating "Corrective Lens" or something similar). For a driver with vision restrictions, driving without correction constitutes a moving violation and will get you ticketed.
<ul><li> Shows up every season of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CanadasWorstDriver">Canada's Worst Driver</a>; it's mentioned only when a driver fails to fullfil this.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLambert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLambert">Christopher Lambert</a> has Myopia and is almost entirely blind without his glasses. Since he cannot wear contacts, he is often forced to act while unable to see anything clearly (making the fact that almost all his roles require fighting or some form of strenuous physical activity all the more impressive). This is also the reason behind his trademark intense gaze as he is really just trying to see what's in front of him.
</li><li> Actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesSpader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesSpader">James Spader</a> has such poor eyesight that in any film where he doesn't wear glasses—which is most of them—he can barely make out the face(s) of the other actor(s) in the scene with him..
</li><li> It's actually surprisingly common for people who need vision correction but don't have contact lenses to go without their glasses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo">if they don't like the way they look with them on</a>. It's the little things that usually tip off the people around them - not noticing obvious signage, etc.
<ul><li> In a surprising aversion, most glasses-wearers (particularly those with Myopia) see <strong>better</strong> while underwater without their glasses; plus, in most cases, also see better than "normal"-visioned people. This has to do with the different refractive index of water vs air. This is part of the issue with why prescription goggles are far less popular than prescription sunglasses. It's also why many competitive swimming clubs have a timing clock installed underwater, in addition to one sitting on deck—many swimmers have a far better chance of reading a time clock 10 yards away on the bottom of the pool than a clock sitting on deck at the same distance.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HarryTruman">Harry Truman</a> had wanted to attend the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy">Military Academy</a> at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">West Point</a> as a young man, but his eyesight was so bad they couldn't take him—he could hardly see a thing without his glasses (his left eye was so bad it was beyond the threshold of legal blindness). When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> started, he wanted to join the Missouri National Guard, but realized that he'd face the same problem—so he memorized the eye chart before being told to take his glasses off and ended up a captain in the artillery, i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">the branch of the Army dedicated to shooting at things really far away</a>. He was actually quite successful<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2xuix');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2xuix" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2xuix');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is probably easier than it sounds, especially for the time - artillery strikes are usually made against targets far beyond the range of even perfect vision, requiring someone to watch through binoculars or telescopes, and the rest is just math—for which Truman had a head, and was in any case ably assisted by some very fancy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk">mechanical computers</a>.</span>.
</li><li> John Kipling had extremely poor vision without his glasses, and was turned away from the Army in WWI. At his insistence, his father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RudyardKipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, pulled strings to get him a commission anyway. He died at the Battle of Loos.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatyManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KatyManning">Katy Manning</a> (Jo Grant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>) wore thick glasses when off camera. On camera, she was prone to crashing into the scenery or other actors. You know how the Doctor always takes his companion by the hand and runs with her? It started with Jo Grant, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonPertwee">Jon Pertwee</a> needed to guide his essentially blind co-star. At one point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerDelgado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RogerDelgado">Roger Delgado</a> does the same, which ends up looking like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog">Pet the Dog</a> moment for the Master.
</li><li> Charlie Munger, Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Corporation, is blind in his left eye and has little peripheral vision in the other
</li><li> Famously, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> knew how blind he was without his glasses and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">had multiple back up glasses attached to his coat</a> when he took his volunteer Rough Riders to Cuba so that he'd always have a backup in case he lost his current pair. His eyesight was so poor that, even with glasses, he could only reasonably read large fonts, a fact that wound up saving his life when a thick pocketbook containing a campaign speech slowed an assassin's bullet enough to protect his vital organs.
</li><li> Film composer Franz Waxman scalded his eyes when he was three years old, permanently impairing his vision and forcing him to wear thick glasses for the rest of his life.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElijahWood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElijahWood">Elijah Wood</a>. Even though his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatBeautifulEyes">round, bright blue eyes</a> are his most striking facial feature, he's horribly nearsighted and is never without glasses or contact lenses. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">irony</a> has not escaped him or his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> co-stars, as explained in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u05hcDVKSIk">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> behind the scenes video.
</li><li> American tenor Jan Peerce, who sang with the Metropolitan Opera in the mid-20th century, was so nearsighted that, whenever he was offstage, he had to wear glasses with lenses that were, in his own words, "as thick as the bottom of Coca-Cola bottles."
