Words that mean one thing in language A but an obscene, rude or inappropriate thing in language B are technically called "Cacemphatons", which in itself is a sort of cacemphaton. A sort of in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">Bilingual Bonus</a>, either a word in the work's language sounds silly in a fictional language or the fictional word sounds silly in the work's language.

</p><p>There are also "false cognates", in which two words in different languages have similar forms and meanings, but different roots. For example, the English word "sheriff" and the Arabic "sharif", both being legal officials. The former comes from the Old English <em>scīrgerefa</em>, meaning "shire-reeve", and the latter comes from the Arabic <em>sharafa</em>, meaning "noble" or "exalted".

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em>, there's an English girl named "Ana". It is discovered that in Japanese, "ana" means "hole", a fact which Miu reminds her of a couple of times in the next few episodes.
</li><li> Some Spanish speakers who watch <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> tend to giggle when the name "Kakarotto/Kakarot" is heard, since the "kaka" part sounds like "caca" which means crap.
<ul><li> Same problem in Italy, "Kakarot" was changed to "Kaharot".
</li><li> This is the reason "Chichi"'s name got translated as "Milk" in the Mexican dub as "Chichi" means "tit/boob" in most parts of Mexico.
</li><li> Chichi also means "milk" or "udder" in Japanese, and is a slang word for "tits" (from a baby word for "breast").
</li><li> Oddly Chichi was never renamed in Spain, despite it being a very extended slang for "vagina".
</li><li> In-universe example: when Bulma went aboard the Namek spaceship, the ship started doing all sorts of weird stuff, opening doors and dragging her around. Mr. Popo explained that she kept saying things that translated to legitimate requests in Namek language.
</li></ul></li><li> Saying out loud in France that you're a fan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Kakashi</a> is problematic for similar reasons, since "caca", pronounced the same as "Kaka", also means crap in French ; and "shi" is pronounced the same as "chie", which means "shit" (the verb).
</li><li> Since Spanish and Japanese share surprisingly similar phonologies, this happens a lot with many series:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">Rito Yuuki</a> sounds pretty funny in Spanish, since his name sounds like a faux male form of the Spanish name "Rita", not to mention "Rito" sounds the same like the Spanish suffix <em>-rito</em> used mainly as a diminutive (as in <em>Señorito</em> (Young master) or even worse: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Condorito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Condorito">Condorito</a>.</em>)
<ul><li> It doesn't help that both Rito and Condorito are both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">accidental perverts.</a></em>
</li></ul></li><li> Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Mami Tomoe's name</a> sounds disturbingly funny in many Spanish dialects, since her name "Mami" sounds the same as the Spanish diminutive for "Mommy", but also sounds the same as an affectionate (but in most cases <em>very derogative</em>) term for a woman in some Latin American countries, especially in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Panama. Mami's mammies, too.
</li><li> If you think <em>Mami</em> already sounds corny in Spanish, there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DailyLifeWithMonsterGirl">Daily Life with Monster Girl</a></em>, when one of the main characters is a harpy named <strong>Papi</strong>, who is Spanish for <em>Daddy</em>, who, in context, could be a slang for <em>pimp</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AquarionEvol">Aquarion Evol</a></em> has two unfortunate examples with two characters: Mikono Suzushiro and the villain Mykage Towano. Mikono's name sounds the same like the Spanish phrase "Mi cono" <em>(My cone)</em>, or in more perverse meaning, if you replace the letter N of her name with the Spanish-exclusive letter Ñ, sounds like "Mi coño" <em>(My pussy)</em>. Mykage Towano is even worse: his name sounds very similar to "Me cagué (en) tu ano" <em>(I crapped in your anus)</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chii</a> sounds like the Mexican slang word <em>chis</em> which means <em>Piss</em>.
</li><li> China Kousaka from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters">Gundam Build Fighters</a></em> is a very unfortunate example, as her name sounds the same as both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/China">China</a> (The country) and the word "china" (Spanish for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChinesePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChinesePeople">Chinese girl</a></em>). The fact she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterchangeableAsianCultures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterchangeableAsianCultures">Japanese</a> makes her name even more unfortunate. And to make matters worse, Sunrise released a figure of her dressed like a Beargguy III, the Gunpla she uses in the series. The name of that figure? <strong><a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/bbs/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=3067429">Chinagguy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></strong>
<ul><li> Mao Yasaka is an even more unfortunate example, both in Western and Japanese orders, as his name sounds like <em>Mao, Ya saca (suffix/noun)</em> (Mao, please pull/take that [thing]). Depending on the suffix used in Spanish, it could sound like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGuys">something straight out from a Yaoi manga</a>.
</li><li> Daiki Miyaga from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFightersTry">Gundam Build Fighters Try</a></em> is another example: His last name sounds like <em>Mi llaga</em> (My sore).
</li><li> From the same series, the name of the school Shimon Izuna belongs to is named <em>Joto</em>. While both in Japanese and English is pronounced as "Yoh-toh", in Mexican Spanish, when pronounced phonetically as "Hoh-Toh", it sounds like the Mexican slang for <em>fag</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">Mikoto</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">Misaka</a> sounds very similar as <em>Mi coto me saca</em>. (My suburb kicks me out)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Mikasa Ackerman's</a> name sounds like <em>Mi casa</em>. (My house) This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in Latin America (and also in English too) when she's paired with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar">Tsukasa Hiiragi</a>, as <em>Tsukasa</em> sounds like <em>su casa</em> (Your house) and mixing both names sounds like the famous Spanish greeting <em>Mi Casa (Mikasa) es Su Casa (Tsukasa)</em>. (My house is your house)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoldenTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GoldenTime">Kouko Kaga</a> is one of the most unfortunate examples of this: Her name sounds the same as <em>(The) coconut is shitting</em>. This is even worse if you use her name in the Japanese order, since it could sound like <em>Caga Coco</em>. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowelBreakingBricks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BowelBreakingBricks">Coconut-shitter</a>)
<ul><li> It sounds more funny in Portuguese. Depending on the subtitler, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">the character's name is spelled without the 'u'</a> and depending on the form the character's name and surname are placed, "Koko Kaga" sounds like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecursiveReality">poo shitting</a>" and "Kaga Koko" sounds like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">shitting poo</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor">Mimika Mikagami</a>'s name from the sequel <em>Exodus</em> sounds like <em>mimica</em> (Female Mimic). Extra hilarity, in a meta way, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuiIshikawa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuiIshikawa">she's voiced by the same voice actress who voiced the already mentioned Mikasa and China</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD">Issei Hyodo</a> sounds similar to <em>Hice Yodo</em> (As both <em>I made Iodine</em> or <em>I pissed Iodine</em>). Keep in mind the letter H is silent in Spanish and French.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OsomatsuKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OsomatsuKun">Chibi</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">ta</a> sounds the same as the Mexican Spanish word for <em>little goat</em> (chivita). Most native Spanish speakers likely cannot help but hear the childhood nursery rhyme "Sal de ahí, chivita, chivita" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note01liq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note01liq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note01liq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Translation: Come out, little goat, little goat!</span> playing in their heads whenever the name "Chibita" comes up. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18qw9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18qw9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18qw9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Admit it. You're hearing it right now, too.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> sounds like saying <em>(It will) la-la-last</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LoveLive">Nico Yazawa</a>'s name is somewhat troublesome in Spanish, Italian and Serbian, as "Nico/Niko" is normally a male name in those regions and, at least in Spanish, Nico is a diminitive of "Nicolas".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>
<ul><li> <em>Hamon</em>, the Japanese name for the Ripple, the name of the energy used in the first two parts, sounds the same as "Jamón", the Spanish word for "Ham".
</li><li> In a related note, the famous "MUDA MUDA MUDA!" of Dio happens to literally mean (and also sound) "TESTICLES TESTICLES TESTICLES!" in both Serbian and Russian. Since "muda" is also Spanish for "mute" in the feminine form, Dio can appear as if he's relentlessly accusing opponents of being vocally disabled.
</li><li> In the fourth part, Crazy Diamond's "DORA" is also a common female name in Mexico. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Predictably</a>, this has led to jokes and memes involving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer">Dora the Explorer</a></em> in some manner.

<ul><li> The same anime had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example - the main character's father's name, Yusyo (as the anime romanises it), is pronounced "Yuushou", which sounds like the English phrase "You show". The school that he founded is called "You Show Duel School".
</li><li> The English dub also pulls one on occasion for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">Woolseyism</a>'s sake; Yuya's Synchro Dimension counterpart is called Yugo, which sounds a lot like <em>yuugou</em> (Fusion), leading to Yugo being confused for a Fusion Dimension soldier. Though the English version preserves the mistake of Yugo being seen as the 'Pawn of Fusion', it can't make the pronunciation joke, so it instead has characters mishear his name as "you go!".

</li><li> This is reportedly why the pronunciation of "Arceus" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> was changed from "Ar-say-oos" (Japanese) to "Ark-ee-us" (English) - the dubbers thought "Ar-say-oos" sounded too much like "arse" (British mildly vulgar term for the backside, equivalent to "ass" in American English).
</li><li> Many Russian fans has pointed out how funny the name of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SukaSuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SukaSuka">Sukasuka</a></em> sounds in Russian, as it basically sounds like "bitch bitch" in that language.

In Japanese, that would mean "bag", because she can't remember her name and was dubbed so for her big backpack. Yet in Russian, <em>kaban</em> (кабан) literally means "wild boar".

In particular, Tal'dira calls Wedge Antilles "Wedgan'tilles", which is close to "slayer of stars" in Twi'leki. Apparently pronouncing it the way humans do changes the meaning to something like "one so foul as to induce vomiting in a rancor".
<ul><li> This is apparently rather common; in the Twi'lek language the meaning of a word or phrase can be radically altered by mispronouncing even a single syllable. It's sometimes done even to a fellow Twi'lek's name, for the opposite reason: twisting the pronunciation into something insulting.

The characters had to come up with a name for a mini-microwave after the first name had this problem. Apparently, a Franco-Dutchman would pronounce the original name "The Bitenuker" as "Bet Nyuker" which is awful. Legal rejected all of their other names as offensive in some language or another, including English (apparently they knew what Franks suggestion of a "Hot Richard" actually meant). Finally, they agree on the name "The Funcooker". At this time, Tracy reveals on national television that thats what he calls his anus.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em> episode "Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan", Monk hears something that sounds like "She's now gone meatless." It turns out to be Latvian for "This is not my coat."

The problem is, they often sound to Finns like... well... various things, ranging from offensive to perverted to just plain weird, but always something hilarious, and he will always be lovingly known as "Pensseli-setä" (Uncle Paintbrush) to all Finns, because of a repeating phrase in one of his songs, <em>Niilin Hanhet</em> (Geese of the Nile). His songs can be found on Youtube, with Finnish subtitles. Other songs by him include <em>Lakana</em> (The sheet), <em>Hajusavu</em> (Scented smoke), <em>Mursuvaara</em> (The Danger of Walruses) and the amusing (but incompletely subbed) <em>Olen Gaaaaay!</em> (I am <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Gaaaay</a>).

<ul><li> Fujiwara no Moukou is maybe one the biggest offenders, especially in Spanish, because her name <em>Moukou</em> sounds as the Spanish word <em>Moco</em> (Snot) and that the reason she's nicknamed in Spanish as <em>Fujiwara no Moco</em>.

</li><li> Sanae Kochiya's last name sounds like the word <em>Cuchilla</em> (blade or knife) in Spanish.
</li><li> Okina Matara's full name sounds even funny in either East Asian or Western orders in Spanish, once again: In the western one, her name sounds more or less exactly as "Okina will kill (someone)", especially if the you stress the accent in the last A of "Matara". In the Asian one, it will sound like "Matará (a) Okina" (She/He (will) kill Okina) instead.
</li><li> Narumi Yatadera's surname is equally funny in Spanish, as it sounds disturbingly close to "matadera", the Spanish slang word for either "massacre" or "slaughterhouse".
</li><li> Suika Ibuki's name could sound funnier for Romanian players, since her name "Suika" sound similar to "țuică" (Pronounced as "Tzuica"), which is the Romanian name for a kind of moonshine, which is particulary funny, considering Suika is a hard drinker.
<ul><li> Russians can't let Suika go as well, since <em>Sui-ka</em> in Russian can be roughly translated as "come on and put it inside". Even worse with "Ibu" in "Ibuki", since <em>yebu</em> (which is phonetically similar) is a really obscene word for sex.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SenranKagura">Hibari</a>'s name sounds like the Spanish name of the Amazonian tribe the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuar_people">Shuar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who are better known in Spanish as <em>Jibaros</em> (Pronounced as <em>Hee-bah-ros</em>) or more known in popular culture as <em>Head-Hunters</em> due to their custom of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">cutting their enemies' heads and shrink them as trophies</a>.
<ul><li> All the characters use Hiden Ninpo, or "Secret Ninja Arts". In English, this sounds like "Hidden Ninpo", which is quite intelligible all by itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the French version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em>, Seismitoad is called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScunthorpeProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScunthorpeProblem">Crapustule</a> (from <em>crapaud</em>, meaning "toad").
</li><li> In Japanese, Jigglypuff is called Purin and Clefairy is called Pippi. In French, "purin" means "manure" and Pippi sounds like "pipi", which means "pee".
</li><li> In Japanese, Magmar is called Boober and Mandibuzz is called Vulgina, which sound like female body parts to English-speakers. Similarly, Umbreon is called Blacky, which is a portmanteau of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">English words</a> "black" and "lucky" but sounds like a racist slur.
</li><li> In German, the attack Aerial Ace is known as "Aero-Ass". Much hilarity was shared around this by the English-speaking fandom. Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> Golisopod is known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScunthorpeProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScunthorpeProblem">Tectass</a>".
</li><li> A comedic example: 'Heahea City' may get a few giggles out of Cantonese speakers, as '<a class="urllink" href="https://words.hk/zidin/v/90522/hea%20/%20hae">hea<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>' is a slang term that means 'to idle', or 'to laze about'.
</li></ul></li><li> An example of both types: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimonTheSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimonTheSorcerer">Simon the Sorcerer</a> 2</em>, a man called Um Bongo tells the protagonist that his name would mean Stupid rabbit's colon.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, The Draenei's capitol city is called <em>The Exodar</em> and they revere these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> called Naaru. One of the Draenei quotes is "We did not realize, but in Naaru Language, <em>Exodar</em> means Defective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp">Elekk</a> Turd."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, you'll meet a quarian Admiral of the ship Qwib-Qwib, which renders his name Zaal'Koris vas Qwib-Qwib. Silly sounding, but not so bad. He mentions that he sometimes considers transferring to a ship with a more respectable name, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">like the Iktomi or the Defrahnz.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnePieceUnlimitedCruise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OnePieceUnlimitedCruise">One Piece Unlimited Cruise</a> 1</em> and <em>2</em>, there's a funny bit for Swedish players. When using the Gomu Gomu no Fuusen you have to jump and then press the attack button. When jumping Luffy makes a noise sounding like (h)aahp, when using the aforementioned technique he says <em>fuusen</em> rather quickly. Time these to sounds right and Luffy says <em>aputek</em>, which is really close to the Swedish word <em>apotek</em> which means chemists shop.
</li><li> The town of Jachol in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> is basically pronounced the same as the Filipino slang word for masturbation.
</li><li> Filipino <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Neptunia">Neptunia</a></em> fans will laugh at the name of the new goddess in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyperdimensionNeptuniaVictory">Victory</a></em>, Pururut. Because it's also the slang word for "loose bowel movement" (diarrhea). The name has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">changed</a> to Plutia for the English release.
</li><li> A since-removed splash screen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> (although still included in the Legacy Console Edition) reads "SOPA means LOSER in Swedish!" It actually means "garbage" as a noun or "to sweep" as a verb, but is often used as a insult in Sweden, so it kinda works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FantasyLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FantasyLife">Fantasy Life</a></em>'s Origin Island DLC, the Islanders get some amusement from the name of the player's home dimension, Reveria. Apparently in their language "reveria" means something along the lines of "warm, snuggly toes."
</li><li> The general romaji for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a></em> villain Dark Fact is "Dalk Fukt". Ditto the other family members in <em>Ys Origin</em>.
</li><li> The name of 2B, the main heroine of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> could sound funny for Chinese players, as 2B is the online shorthand of the Chinese word 二屄 (Èr bī) who is normally translated as <em>fucking idiot</em>.
</li><li> Overlapping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide">No Pronunciation Guide</a>, In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KisekiSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KisekiSeries">Trails</a></em> series, the monotheistic goddess worshiped across Zemuria is named <em>Aidios</em>. In Spanish, her name pronounced phonetically sounds <em>exactly</em> as the exclamation <em>¡Ay, Dios!</em> (Oh god!), making any scene when the characters invoke her name incredibly awkward for Spanish-speaking players. In actuality, it's pronounced as "A-dee-ose", something that's not apparent unless you're playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel">The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</a></em>, as it features several lines of English voice acting. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a></em> lacks any voice acting outside of battle quotes, so you won't hear it unless you've unlocked Kloe's final S-Craft where she pronounces it correctly. Similarly, the kingdom where <em>Sky</em> takes place is named "liberl", which leads most players assuming it's pronounced like the word "liberal" with a stress at the end when <em>Cold Steel</em> would clarify it has the somewhat unintuitive pronunciation of "lie-burr-ull".
</li><li> Due of the way how the naming engine works, many of the regens (original players created by the computer either for filling out empty slots in teams which need the mandatory players or expies from retired players) in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager">Football Manager</a></em> series could sound especially funny, depending of the nationality of the player, along obviously of course, real life players (see below for details). Some of those names are really memetic by themselves, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lenon</a> (with a single N, and being Brazilian), Turkirsh "Ufuk Ozil", English "Prince Salami", American "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Dick Hunter</a>", British "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggusDickus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggusDickus">Dick Monster</a>" and Argelian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Laid Gagaa</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights2">Neverwinter Nights 2</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a> is called the The Vale Of Merdelain, which is probably meant to sound cool/scary, but given that "merde" is French for "shit", it's rather like if they named a dungeon the shitarium or something like that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheIdolmaster">The Idolmaster</a> Shiny Colors</em>, there's a girl named Koito Fukumaru. For Spanish-speakers, her name <em>Koito</em> sounds the same as the Spanish word for <em>coitus</em>.
</li><li> There's an organization called the Kurvaz in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo">Solatorobo</a></em>. They were, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">as the world the game takes place in is populated by anthro dogs and cats</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlintstoneTheming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlintstoneTheming">named after the Kuvasz dog breed</a>, but the name sounds like the word for "whore" in a lot of Slavic languages.

</li><li> The Brazilian version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em> had to change the main villain's name from "Aku" to "Abu" because the former sounds like their word for anus.
</li><li> Similarly, the Dutch version of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> episode "Mystery of a Thousand Moons" had to have the so-called god of Iego's name, "Drol", changed to "Grol", due to apparent phonetic similarities to their word for "poo".

This makes things like Episode 43's title ("XANA's Kiss") and its subordinates ("XANA's monsters") sound like things you'd find in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainBleach">deep recesses of the internet</a> rather than a Saturday morning cartoon. To avoid this, the dubs tend to pronounce the name as "Zena".

Hasbro also confirmed in 2008 that they will no longer be using the name "Slag" for any new toys.
</li><li> Many of the catchphrases and some names of the members of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em> (and by default, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em>'s) cast could sound funny in many languages:
<ul><li> Kion's "Hevi kabisa": In Japanese, "hevi" sounds exactly like the word for "snake". (with a "b" instead)
</li><li> Bunga's "Zuka zama" sounds incredibly awkward in both Japanese and Russian: The whole phrase sounds like saying "Zuka-sama" (Lord Zuka), being "-sama" a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">Japanese honorific</a>. For Russians, this is even worse, as "zuka" sounds the same as "suka", literally translated as "bitch". Even worse if you mix <em>both</em> languages, as it will sound like "Lord/Lady Bitch". The Japanese dub tries to tone down this a bit by spelling it as ズカ・ザマー
</li><li> Ono is a proper Japanese surname, albeit in the Japanese dub, his name is written in a different way and in katakana (オーノ rather than 小野)
</li><li> Depending of the way the Japanese kanji is spelled, Reirei could sound like "Rei Rei", basically "zero zero", "spirit spirit", and many other spellings.
</li><li> Dogo is a slang for dog in either Mexico and Argentina, quite fitting, because he's a jackal.
</li><li> Makuu, depending of the kanji used, sounds like "Demonic/Magical Sky" in Japanese. (魔空)
</li><li> Pua sounds like the Spanish for "plectrum".
</li><li> Tamaa, with a single "a", sounds like the Japanese word for "ball". It's also a Japanese common name for a cat.
</li><li> Timon sounds exactly the same as the Spanish word for a ship's ruddle.
</li><li> Banzai sounds incredibly awkward in Japanese (and anybody else, for that matter), as it sounds like the (in)famous war scream uttered by Japanese soldiers in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, albeit it can be used in other contexts. Literally, it means "ten thousand years" in Japanese and "skulk" or "lurk" in Swahili.

</li><li> <em>Schlitz</em>, in German, means 'slit,' and by obvious extension, is a slang term for 'vagina.' Of course, in English, it sounds an awful lot like 'shits,' so this is just icing on the cake.

</li><li> In Romanian, a lot of English words have been largely incorporated into the language informally (meaning that absolutely everybody knows what they mean), such as "movie" and "ball". Thus, when trying to pronounce "football" correctly in Romanian, the result is homophonous with the term "fut ball", which roughly means "fucking a ball".

<ul><li> The ubiquitous word <em>dik</em> (at least in formal writing) most often means, roughly, "that which belongs to someone" or as a universal suffix to adjectives and adverbs.
</li><li> This combined with the fact that "-son" sounds almost identical to the Cantonese word for "god", it gives rise to some unfortunate puns for people named "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">Dickson</a>" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7mkbv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7mkbv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7mkbv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which, for this case, "translates" to "the god who is"</span>.

</li><li> The English words "poor guy" infamously sounds extremely similar to a common Cantonese swearing term "Pok gai" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8uimx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8uimx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8uimx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the record, it literally means "to fall on a street facedown", and is a very versatile word indeed. It's commonly used as a noun to mean "someone who deserves to fall on a street facedown" (in other words, an asshole). It's also a common curse word roughly meaning 'go to hell!' and (less commonly) used as an exclamation in ways similar to 'damn it' and 'oh crap'. It's also a vulgar way of saying that someone is 'condemned', i.e. screwed. And finally, it can also mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">'epic fail'</a>.</span>, and has been used for the purpose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a> for, like, a million instances, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">even by Legislative Councillors</a> (think senators). However, in Hokkien dialect, Pok gai means [to go] bankrupt- which strangely enough, complements the English words.
</li><li> "Nazi" in Cantonese is pronounced exactly the same as "tax paying" save for a minor pitch change.
</li><li> In Cantonese, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Socrates">Socrates</a> sounds like "scratching armpits".
</li><li> Picasso sounds somewhat like "Buk ga si sok" (written in Chinese characters as "不加思索"), which means "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueArtIsIncomprehensible">not putting any thought into it</a>".
</li><li> "Due" sounds like the Cantonese word "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diu_(Cantonese)">Diu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" with a tonal change. "Diu" is basically the Cantonese equivalent of the English word "fuck": both are vulgar ways to say "to have sex with", and commonly used as a curse word in their respective languages <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9qq57');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9qq57" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9qq57');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you are curious, the rough Mandarin equivalent is "Chào"</span>. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveAWholeNewMeaning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiveAWholeNewMeaning">gives a whole new meaning</a> to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX">Due date</a>".
</li><li> "Delay no more" sounds like a particular obscene Cantonese swearing term far surpassing "poor guy" - "Diu nei lo mo". It literally means "fuck your old mother". Naturally, Cantonese speakers regularly joke about this - especially Hongkongers, who not only speak Cantonese, but are also exposed to English.
</li><li> In Japanese, 'hai' means yes. In Cantonese, 'hai' (pronounced with an emphasis on the 'i' as opposed to the 'a' and with a gradually-rising tone as opposed to a flat tone) means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">something else entirely</a>.
</li><li> Cantonese speakers occasionally joke about the English word "handsome", because it sounds quite similar to the Cantonese word "haam sup" (written in Chinese characters as "鹹濕"), which means "<em>raunchy</em>" or "<em>sexually perverted</em>". If you describe a male friend as "handsome" and think this will help him impress the Cantonese girls you're talking to... well, just be extra careful with your pronunciation.
</li><li> In a reverse example, the Cantonese words for "flower bridge" (花橋) sound like "fuck you" in English.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Standard Mandarin</strong>:
<ul><li> Another reverse example, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CulturalRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CulturalRevolution">Cultural Revolution</a> the nickname of one of the Gang of Four who came to power on the left was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentlyFunnyWords">Helicopter Wang</a>", so named because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare">how quickly he rose to power</a>.
</li><li> Japanese versus Chinese. The antiquated name for China, taken from English's predilection for renaming everyone not European, Shina is written 支那。 If you speak Chinese, that is pronounced differently and means "discrimination," which Japan was using this term when they thought it would be a good idea to join England and France in pillaging and conquering. And there was absolutely a lot of discrimination from conquerors toward the actual people of China, to say the least.
</li><li> "give us..." (written 给我们) in Mandarin Chinese is romanized as "gei wo men."
</li><li> There's also "zou hou men," which, while it doesn't sound like anything in English, it colloquially means bribing and literally means "through the back door," or "back door bargaining."
</li><li> Also "bu shi" (is not), which sounds like "bullshit" with an accent.
</li><li> Then there's "bu shi mao" (it's not a cat) which sounds remarkably like the Dutch "poesje mauw", a child's way of saying, yes, cat (equivalent to "pussy cat").
</li><li> "That one there" (那一个) is pronounced 'na yi ge' in Mandarin. In casual speech, this gets slurred into 'nei ge', which sounds like a very racist n-word. It doesn't help that it tends to be used the same way the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValleyGirl">Valley Girl</a> uses "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeIsLikeAComma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeIsLikeAComma">like</a>".
</li><li> Another joke turns "31 people" (<em>san shi i wei</em>) into "Killed one person" (<em>Saa shi i wei</em>).
</li><li> The name of the famous cell phone brand Huawei sounds incredibly funny for Mexicans, as the name, pronounced phonetically, sounds similar to <em>¡Ay, guey!</em>, which means either "Oh, dude!" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Holy shit!</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Both/multiple</strong>:
<ul><li> The character 福, meaning "good fortune" in various East Asian languages, is romanized as "fuk" in Cantonese, "phúc" in Vietnamese, and "fuku" in Japanese. Let's... just say none of these sounds exactly like 'good fortune' to an English speaker. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note107na1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note107na1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note107na1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Vietnamese and Japanese aren't technically Sinitic, but they do have a lot of words in common with the Chinese languages, especially with Cantonese. This is because these two have been heavily influenced by Middle Chinese, to which Cantonese is very close</span>
</li><li> The character 王, both a term meaning "king" and a common surname, is romanized as "Wang" in standard Mandarin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX">Cue the immature jokes</a>, though it should be noted that it's actually pronounced more like "wong"; and in Hokkien - the Chinese language spoken in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taiwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Taiwan">Taiwan</a> and the Southern province of Fujian - the same character is romanized as "<em>Bong</em>" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11x7xv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11x7xv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11x7xv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Aaaaand if you are curious, the character is pronounced "Wong" in Cantonese, "Waan" in Shanghainese, and "Uōng" in Gan. But in microvariants of Hokkien spoken in South-East Asia, it's sometimes romanized as "<em>Ong</em>", without the letter B.</span>.
</li><li> On a second note, to a Cantonese speaker, "wang" sounds more like "broken (usually some sort of tools or appliance)" (Chinese character: 軭) than "king" (which, as mentioned, would be "wong" in Cantonese).
</li><li> This happens even among Chinese languages themselves. The various Chinese languages can give identical-sounding words <em>very</em> different meanings. One language/dialect uses <em>haizi</em> to mean "<a class="urllink" href="http://lang-8.com/64745/journals/207435">shoes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" while it means "Child(ren)" in standard Mandarin. An adult claiming they've lost their <em>haizi</em> on the train can just be grumbling in one part of China and the cause of panic in another.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The French term for Swedish meatballs? <em>Boules suédoises</em>, or "Swedish balls." So in France, you can mention that you like putting Swedish balls in your mouth.
</li><li> A lot of names are problematic in different languages. Marika for example corresponds to marica ('fag') in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage">Spanish</a>, while the Japanese name Junko might look really bad on paper to any English speaker without knowledge of Japanese.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage">German</a> word for "thick"/"fat" is "dick".
</li><li> This sometimes ends up in a pun when someone can't use the ~ symbol in "año" (year) and asks "Cuantos anos tienes?" (Literally, "How many anuses do you have?"). Something hilariously similar happens in Italian, if you can't pronounce double letters: "anno" (year) becomes "ano" - so asking "Quanti ani hai?" is, once again, asking how many anuses you possess.
<ul><li> In Portuguese, <em>ano</em> means "year". The plural <em>anos</em> (years), usually<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12y2ep');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12y2ep" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12y2ep');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The 'o' in word endings tends to sound like 'u', but, depending on the specific region, it may be different</span> sounds like <em>ânus</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">anus</a>). Once, a reporter asked a female criminal who had just been arrested "Quantos anos você tem?" (literally "How many years you have", but meaning "How old are you"). The woman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">sarcastically answered</a> "Ânus, eu só tenho um, mas se você quer saber minha idade, é 26" ("I have only one anus, but, if you want to know my age, it's 26").
<ul><li> In Latin, which Spanish, Portuguese and Italian are derived from, <em>annus</em> is "year," while <em>anus</em> means exactly what you would think it means. Both are declined identically, and the only difference in pronunciation is the length for which the "n" sound is held.
</li></ul></li><li> In Czech, <em>ano</em> (shortened to <em>no</em>, unlike in English pronounced with a monophtong) means "yes". In Polish, <em>ano tak</em> and <em>no tak</em> are also colloquial forms of "yes" (regular word is simply <em>tak</em>). And <em>no</em>, especially in internet communicators, may be interpreted as colloquial "yes" or English "no".
<ul><li> "No" in Czech, actually, can mean both <em>yes</em> and <em>well,...</em>, depending on context. Which of course means it's a very frequently used word.
</li><li> And <em>no tak</em> in Czech means something more along the lines of "come on".
</li></ul></li><li> In Japanese, <em>ano</em> means "that" or "um".
</li><li> In Filipino, "ano" is the equivalent of "what".
</li></ul></li><li> Once again, Japanese and Spanish share similar words, since despite how different those languages are from one another, their phonetics are surprisingly similar. For instance, the vowel sounds are literally identical in both languages<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13mb6e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13mb6e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13mb6e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This has the consequence that Japanese is shockingly easy to pronounce for Spanish speakers. Japanese speakers have a slightly more difficult time pronouncing Spanish, due to sounds like the "j" or the strong "r", but still, for them it's easier than to pronounce English</span>. Here are some very visible examples:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pettanko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Pettanko">Pettanko</a> normally means <em>flat-chested</em>, but in Mexican Spanish, it sounds similar to the word <em>petacón</em> (male) or <em>petacona</em> (female), which is Mexican slang for <em>big ass</em>.
</li><li> The Japanese slang word <em>manko</em> (pussy) sounds the same as the Spanish word <em>manco</em> which means "someone without an arm".
<ul><li> "Manko" is also a German word, meaning "flaw" or "defect".
</li><li> In Polish it means "fraud".
</li><li> In Portuguese, "manco" means "lame man" (in the sense of "unable to walk normally").
</li></ul></li><li> Japanese car makers also seem to have a knack for coming up with car names which are unacceptable in Spanish: there's the Mitsubishi <em>Pajero</em> (Wanker), the Nissan <em>Moco</em> (Snot) and the Mazda <em>Laputa</em> (Thewhore)!
</li><li> Nissan managed to invert this, for many years they sold a model called <em>Tsubame</em> in Mexico - the name is Japanese for swallow (the bird) but sounds like "Pick me up" in Spanish.
</li><li> Many Japanese women who work or have worked as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Miko</a> in Japan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverHeardThatOneBefore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverHeardThatOneBefore">have endured the fact</a> that when they traveled to Spanish-speaking countries, that word sounds the same as <em>Mico</em> which is a Spanish synonym for the word <em>monkey</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when they try to describe their job there.
</li><li> There is a train station in Oyama, Japan named <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamada_Station">Mamada<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. While the word is pretty inocuous in Japanese, in almost all Spanish dialects "mamada" means "fellatio". This is an eternal source for comedy for Spanish speakers who have been to that station.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga">Manga</a> sounds the same as the Spanish word for "sleeve". In Spanish, however, confusion is avoided by using the Japanese word in masculine (<em>El</em> manga), while the Spanish word is feminine (<em>La</em> manga).
<ul><li> Manga also sounds like the Malay word for <em>mango</em> (mangga).
</li><li> In Portuguese, "manga" can mean either "sleeve" or "mango". It once led to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">"Blind Idiot" Translation</a> when a Brazilian restaurant translated "Suco de manga" (mango juice) as "sleeve juice". The Japanese word gets an acute in the second A to stress the last syllable ("mangá").
</li></ul></li><li> "Muda" means "worthless" in Japanese and "to change clothes" or "to move houses" in Spanish. In the latter, "Muda" is also the feminine word for "mute", as in, woman who's unable to speak.
<ul><li> In Russian, it's also an archaic word meaning "balls."
</li><li> It also means "young" in Malay. That said, theres a paper mill company called "Muda Holdings" in the country. They make paper bags as well as notebooks.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baka">Baka</a> (idiot) sounds the same as the Spanish word "Vaca" (cow), causing lots of bilingual jokes among Japanese and Spanish speakers alike.
<ul><li> It also sounds like the Sanskrit word for crane, from which the yoga pose <em>bakasana</em> (ironically often misnamed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotCrows">crow</a> pose) takes its name.
</li></ul></li><li> To a slightly lesser extent, there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansaiRegionalAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansaiRegionalAccent">Kansai dialect equivalent</a> of "Baka": "Aho". For this one, it sounds like the Spanish word for "garlick": "Ajo". Specially hilarious considering there's a family of recipes in Spain called "ajillo" (a way to say "little garlick") which are very popular in Japan. These are different recipes that cook one main ingredient<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1479bo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1479bo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1479bo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The most popular ones being chicken, shrimps, mushroons and rabbit</span> in a garlick-based sauce. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when Japanese people have this explained to them.
</li><li> In a similar way, the Japanese word for "sesame seeds" (Goma) sounds the same as the Spanish word for either "gum" or "rubber".
</li><li> While tehcnically is not Spanish per se, but a Native Mexican language named "Mayo", which is spoken in Northern Mexico, there is a popular meat stew named <a class="urllink" href="https://visitaobregon.gob.mx/turismo/wakabaki/">Wakabaki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which means "Cow Stew" in Mayo. In Japanese, however, the same word means "Young leaf stage".
</li><li> Playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong">Mahjong</a> and being able to speak Spanish could be an awkward experience, as many terms used in Riichi Mahjong (the Japanese variant) had very... <em>odd</em> soundings in Spanish:
<ul><li> A Chow (Japanese: <em>Chi</em>) is just a one letter short for "Chin", which is the Mexican Spanish for "damn!" or "fuck!"
</li><li> A Pong (<em>Pon</em>) sounds the same as the word for "(You should) put (that)".
</li><li> A Kang (<em>Kan</em>) sounds the same as the alternative word for "dog". It also sounds like to have intercourse in the Hokkien dialect (written cao in Mandarin, the very word whose homophone with is the basis of the Grass mud horse meme).
</li><li> A <em>Dora</em> is normally a female name in Spanish, especially in Mexico.
</li></ul></li><li> "Toro!" Either a bull, or the fatty part of the tuna at a sushi joint.
</li><li> There's a brand of Gashapons named <em>Putitto</em> in Japan. The name itself sounds exactly as, with a single T, the word for "little fag". Technically speaking, it's supposed to be the Japanese spelling of the French word "petite" (small)
</li><li> In an inversion of this, for many Japanese speakers many of the names of many drugs used in Mexico can sound funny for them, since many of them ends with the suffix "-san"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15avyq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15avyq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15avyq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">A Japanese honorific</span>, or sometimes "-zan"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note162nex');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note162nex" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note162nex');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which can be translated as "slash" or "cut" in Japanese</span> like <em>Calozan</em>, an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic. To give you an idea on why it's amusing for Japanese speakers, imagine a tiny bottle of Calozan wearing a fancy top hat and monocle who just got knighted by the Queen of England and given the title "Sir Calo".
</li></ul></li><li> In the same way, Korean and Japanese have some words which sound similar but differ in meaning:
<ul><li> The Korean dish <em>Kimchi</em> sounds similar to <em>kimochi-ii</em> (to feel good). This is nodded at by a Japanese brand of Kimchi, which released a song called <em>Kimchi no Kimochi-ii</em> (Feeling Good with Kimchi).
</li><li> The Japanese name <em>Saeki</em> sounds similar to <em>saekki</em>, which more or less means "you son of a bitch".
</li><li> Korean <em>Oppa</em> (big brother) sounds similar to <em>Oppai</em> (Japanese for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagBoobs">Big Boobs</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Old joke: In Estonian, the phrase for "twelve months" is "kaksteist kuud." When pronounced correctly, it sounds like the English phrase "cocks taste good."
</li><li> Finnish and Japanese have a great number of "shared" words. Sometimes the word-meanings can be uncannily similar. For example Japanese word "yopparatte", "being drunk", sounds oddly similar to the Finnish "juopporatti", a slightly archaic word for a hopeless drunkard.
</li><li> American collectible maker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsItSoundsForeign">Funko</a> seems utterly clueless in the fact that in the language they wish they could speak, "fun" and "unko" both mean "poop," making them either "Poop-ko" or "F-poop."
</li><li> Finnish and Italian have many examples.
<ul><li> Finnish <em>katso!</em> [ˈkatso] ("look!"), Italian <em>cazzo!</em> [ˈkatːso] ("dick" or "fuck!" as an exclamation).
</li><li> Finnish <em>katso merta!</em> [ˈkatso　ˈmerdɑ] ("look at the sea!"), Italian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">''cazzo! merda!'' ("fuck! shit!")</a>
</li><li> Finnish <em>katso minkkiä</em> [ˈkatso　ˈmiŋkːiæ] ("look at the mink"), Italian <em>cazzo minchia</em> [ˈkatːso　ˈmiŋkja] ("cock dick")
</li><li> Finnish <em>katso sukkia</em> ("look at the socks") sounds like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouNoTakeCandle">You No Take Candle</a> Italian for a request for fellatio ("succhia" means "suck")
</li><li> Apina ("ape" in Finnish, "little bee" in Italian), Peto ("beast" in Finnish, "fart" in Italian), Kuulo ("hearing" in Finnish, sounds like Italian and Spanish "culo", "ass"), Matto (Finnish "carpet", Italian "crazy", Spanish "I kill") and Paasto ("fasting" in Finnish, while "pasto", ironically, means "meal" in Italian, and in Spanish, it means "grass").
</li></ul></li><li> Also, the old joke of the Swede that goes into a cab in Denmark asking to be taken to a fun place (<em>ett roligt ställe</em>), just to be transported to a graveyard (In Swedish "ett roligt ställe" = "Somewhere Fun", but in Danish "ett roligt ställe"= "somewhere calm"). This also plays off stereotypes that Swedes and Danes have of one another (cautious and fun-loving, respectively).
<ul><li> Swedish and Danish are prone to this, as the two languages are very similar, with some amusing exceptions. For instance, the Swedish verb for "play ball" (bolla) sounds like the Danish verb for "have sex" (bolle) and the Danish word for "leek" (porre) sounds like the Swedish word for "porn" (porr).
</li></ul></li><li> And then there's the fact that "chin" in Japanese means a....<em>different</em> body part than it is in English. Bilinguals tend to chuckle uncontrollably while reading <em>The Three Little Pigs</em>.
</li><li> A Syrian singer earned the nickname "Pensselisetä" (brush uncle) in Finland after videos of his wedding singing group were put on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> with Finnish subtitles on how the singing sounded like. The "narrative" includes pulling Nile geese up my ass, among other absurd and raunchy twists.
</li><li> Similarly, a video of an Arabian song <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAO1oelk-_M">My Homeland<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, is famously known in Russian as "Furry Whores", due to the way it sounds. There are a couple of obscene <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ChJDNI4RI">subs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Youtube... <strong>very</strong> popular videos.
</li><li> In Dutch, the word for Cook is spelled Kok. For added interest, <em>Kok</em> or <em>de Kok</em> (<em>the cook</em>) are perfectly common Dutch last names. The Prime Minister through most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> was Wim Kok.
<ul><li> And in the other direction, the Dutch "kut" sounds like English "cut" but means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">"cunt"</a>.
</li><li> Flickr, the website, sounds like "flikker" to a Dutchman, which is the local equivalent for "faggot".
</li><li> A sign for a "Kiek in de Kok" museum (despite its Low German name, the most famous one is in Estonia) has become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">somewhat well-known</a> thanks to this trope, sometimes in pictures where tourists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">act out what it sounds like</a>. (It actually means "peep into the kitchen" and refers to a type of guard tower, on the idea of the guards being able to look straight into people's houses.)
</li><li> In Swedish, it's spelled "kock".
</li></ul></li><li> In Afrikaans, the word for "look" is "kyk" (pronounced like "kike"), and the word for "child" is "kind" (pronounced similar to "cunt").
</li><li> The national currency of Vietnam is the đồng. An endless source of amusement for American soldiers during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, the national currency of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Botswana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Botswana">Botswana</a> is the pula, which means "rain" in Tshwana but happens to mean "cock" in Romanian.
</li><li> The French word for 'seal' (the animal) is <em>phoque</em> [fɔk], which sounds like <em>fuck</em>. This has led to Quebecois teenagers wearing shirts that read, <em>"Ouate de phoque"</em> (sounds like "What the fuck"), a nonsense phrase that means "cotton batting from seals."
<ul><li> This is endlessly amusing for English-speaking schoolchildren studying French, especially in Canada (where French is frequently a required subject, and is a common choice for a second language when it isn't). A possibly apocryphal anecdote involved a (very) English-speaking member of Parliament from the Maritimes who nonetheless dropped into French during a debate about the seal harvest. Pronouncing with great emphasis, he asked, "<em>Est-ce que le député est conscient que nous avons des <strong>PHOQUES</strong> par-ci, des <strong>PHOQUES</strong> par là, des <strong>PHOQUES</strong> partout??!!</em>" (Is the honorable member aware that we have seals here, seals there, seals everywhere?) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensued</a> until the Speaker intervened and cautioned the MP that if he was going to keep using that word, to make very sure he was still speaking French.
</li><li> In Spanish they are called focas, too.
<ul><li> Conversely, some English words sound odd in French. In Montreal, you can see some panels reading 'Garage Sale'. In French, it's read as 'Dirty Garage'.
</li></ul></li><li> The taxonomic term (via Latin) for seals is "phocids". It's pronounced "fo-sids", but can sound obscene if mispronounced even in English.
<ul><li> Despite what you might think, the original Latin for seal ("phoca") doesn't have any unfortunate soundalikes. In classical Latin "ph" is simply a strong "p," and in medieval Latin the "c" sound is soft. So you have either "Poh-ka" (classical) or "Foh-sa" (medieval), but not "foh-ka."
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A new word had to be invented ("ordinateur") when computers began being sold in France, because "computer" sounds like "con putain" [kɔ̃　pytɛ̃] ("cunt whore").
</li><li> Famously, when releasing their MR2 sports car in France, Toyota had to shorten the name to simply MR. MR2 in French (<em>emme erre deux</em> [ɛm　ɛʁ　dø]) sounds just like <em>est merdeux</em> [ɛ　mɛʁdø] ("is shitty").
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> has it that the Chevy Nova just would not sell in Mexico until Chevrolet realized that in Spanish, <em>no va</em> is the last thing anyone wants to hear about their car: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">"it doesn't go."</a> But in fact, it sold just fine. Words sounding like "nova" mean "new" in Romance languages; examples include Spanish <em>nueva</em> and French <em>nouveau</em>. Like <em>nueva</em>, "nova" has the accent on the first syllable; <em>no va</em> has it on the second. In other words, "Nova" is just as likely to be read as "doesn't go" in Spanish as "Therapist" is to be read as "The rapist" in English: not likely unless you're on "Celebrity Jeopardy!" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>. That said, it <em>is</em> true that people in Spanish-speaking countries did make the association...as a kind of pun ("<em>Mi Nova no va!</em>" "<em>Jajajajaja!</em>").
<ul><li> The "Jajajajajaja" thing also has its share of laughs: in Polish its written form translates to "memememememe" or "eggseggseggs" and even "ballsballsballs" (and not ones of the toy sort).
</li><li> The above urban legend was based on the absolutely real instance where the Mitsubishi Pajero, named for a kind of small South American wildcat, had its name changed in all Spanish-speaking countries (plus the United States), where the word, pronounced locally, can mean "wanker" (the meaning of <em>Pajero</em> varies based on dialect; the ones where the name was changed are the ones where it's obscene—the US was included because the obscene meaning is used in Mexican Spanish).
</li><li> Averted when Ford Motor Company released its Kuga compact crossover. In Serbo-Croatian (Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, and Montenegrin languages) and Slovenian, <em>Kuga</em> means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">plague</a>. The company disregarded the awkward translation and released the model on the aforementioned markets with no name change.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also Motorola who made an advertising campaign about their phone, Motorola Q. The ad had "My Q" on it. In French this is "Mon Q". Which sounds exactly like "Mon cul". Which means "My ass".
</li><li> The Audi e-tron sounds very weird in French if you pronounce the "e" the French way, since "étron" means "turd".
</li></ul></li><li> About France, it can sometimes be a funny place to live if you know English:
<ul><li> Don't get spooked when you see a French bakery. Even if it is likely to have only word on the sign: "Pain". Yeah, that's French for "bread". "Pain/Pan" (or its homophones) also means "bread" in several other languages — including Japanese (in which case, it is borrowed from Portuguese). On that note, Pain Au Chocolat is not some form of kinky torture involving chocolate.
<ul><li> And "poisson" is just fish. In one of the <em>Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers</em> comics, Fat Freddy ends up in Paris by accident, and is discouraged from trying the local restaurants due to words like these on the menu.
</li><li> French saying: "Poisson sans boisson c'est du poison." (Fish without something to drink is poison).
</li></ul></li><li> "Fanny" used to be a nickname for "Frances". It's still a common girl name in French-speaking countries. In the United States, it means butt, and in the British Commonwealth, it refers to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">ruder part of a woman's anatomy</a>. The opening titles to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FranDrescher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FranDrescher">Fran Drescher</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em> take on a decidedly ruder meaning in New Zealand.
</li><li> Most Americans are aware that the French word for yes sounds like an English slang word for urine or... the area urine comes from: "Oui" is pronounced as "wee." This is usually the default joke when the French language comes up in an American show, as it was for the first month after Nintendo announced the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">its seventh-generation video game console</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A written only (and mostly online) example: the French word for "Hey" is "Salut". A lot of people writing on webchats tend to omit the "a", which can seem a strange way to start a conversation to English-speaking readers.
</li><li> In Japanese, "tako", pronounced the same as "taco", is the word for octopus.
<ul><li> In Spanish, "taco" means, <a class="urllink" href="http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=taco">among numerous other things<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the Mexican foodstuff, or, in Spain, "a four-letter word".
</li><li> In Chile it can also mean 'traffic jam'.
<ul><li> Even a monolingual American can tell the link is authoritative! The webpage has "Real" so prominently displayed upon it, "real" in English means "true" or "actual", "real" in Spanish means either "real" as in English or "royal".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note173kyz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note173kyz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note173kyz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The actual institute is "La Real Academia de la Lengua" with means "The Royal Academy of the [Spanish] Language"</span>
</li><li> And in Mexico, where the meat-in-a-folded-corn-tortilla dish comes from, the word "taco" also means "athletic shoe." This can lead to some confusion when native Spanish speakers try to buy sneakers in English-speaking stores.
</li></ul></li><li> In Swahili, "tako" means "buttock."
</li><li> In French, "un tacot" is slang for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">The Alleged Car</a>.
</li><li> In Serbian, "tako" equals English "so (+ adjective)" or describes how is something done.
</li><li> In Finnish, "takoa" means "hammer" (verb)
</li></ul></li><li> Coca Cola can be transliterated into Chinese many ways, each with a different meaning. For obvious reasons, they went with the one meaning something akin to "to make the mouth experience joy." They actually had to choose something that's pronounced along the lines of "Coca Coleh" to do so, though, as none of the words reading as "la" were remotely appetizing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0veh6');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0veh6" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0veh6');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One means hot, as in hot sauce, but that's not good in a drink</span> — "wax" was actually the most common word reading as "la", hence its ubiquity in the less appetizing unofficial names.
<ul><li> While they were still looking for the official transliteration, some Chinese shopkeepers used random combinations with meanings such as "female horse fastened with wax," "wax-flattened mare," or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole">Bite the Wax Tadpole</a>". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend">Urban Legend</a> incorrectly attributes this error to the Coca Cola Company itself — as mentioned above, they were careful to pick something that actually sounded like a name for a drink.
</li><li> According to Serbian slang, Coca Cola is pronounced the same way as "(he) is killing the car"
<ul><li> Only if you deliberately mispronounce it. Serbian uses pitch accent so although both are spelled as "koka kola", they are not pronounced the same.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Te Reo Māori, the language of New Zealand's indigenous peoples, the particle "whaka-" is used to indicate causation. It sounds identical to the English "fucker". Cue tourists snickering at place names such as Whakatane and Whakapapa.
<ul><li> Doubly hilarious when you understand that "tane" (tah-ne) means "man" or "husband". Whakatane indeed.
</li></ul></li><li> In Italy, you can go to the market and buy some "rape" (turnips).
</li><li> Faggot:
<ul><li> In Italian, "fagotto" is either a bundle or a bassoon. In Japanese, Russian, German, and Polish, a close homonym is the word for bassoon.
</li><li> The word "fagot" also exists in archaic English and French in reference to a bundle (usually sticks or something similar).
</li><li> "Fag" is British slang for a cigarette.
</li><li> "Faggot" is also a (now obscure) British <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(food)">foodstuff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, oddly akin to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Swedish meatballs</a>.
</li><li> "Fag" (though it's pronounced differently) is also the Danish and Norwegian word for "subject" or "lesson".
</li><li> Fagot is also the NATO reporting name for the MiG-15.
</li></ul></li><li> In Spanish, "rape" means "angler fish", "al rape" means "close-cropped" (refering to hair) and "rapé" means "snuff".
</li><li> In Spanish, "to bother" is "molestar."
<ul><li> In French, "râpé" means "grated" or "shredded", as in "fromage râpé" (grated cheese). A lot of French words with the circumflex (the "hat" over the â) used to have an "s"; compare the English word "raspy".
</li></ul></li><li> Another example: Italian "asso" ("ace").
</li><li> More directly, the German "Ass" and Polish "As", again, referring to the card and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a>.
</li><li> The Italian word "caldo" means "hot", from the same root as "calorie" or Spanish "caliente". This can cause problems for tourists speaking languages where something similar sounding means the exact opposite, e. g. German "kalt" and English "cold". This is lampshaded in the Billy Wilder comedy <em>Avanti!</em>, where Jack Lemmon's character got an unpleasant surprise when he turned on the faucet marked "C" in an Italian hotel.
<ul><li> Caldo could be a dish, similar to a soup, in Spanish.
</li></ul></li><li> The Chechen word for their ethnic group is "Vainakh" (literally "our people"; more precisely, the term refers to the ethnolinguistic family that includes Chechens (<em>Noxçi</em>), Ingush (<em>Ghalghai</em>), Bats and Kists). "Voina" (pronounced "vaina") is, of course, the Russian word for "war." This is even funnier if you remember that Chechen people have been at war with Russia for the better part of the past two decades and have developed a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">image.</a>
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzrNWPul9E">"Numnah" is a Hindi word.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Martin Luther had the misfortune of being tried at the Diet of Worms. (Pronounced dee-et of vorms, but how often are you going to hear it out loud?) Similar problems befall the existence of the Japanese Imperial Diet, Japan having copied much of its modernization policies from German states.
<ul><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">The Fifth Elephant</a> </em>- the treaty setting out Uberwaldian life was signed at the Diet of Bugs. Sam Vimes lampshades it.
<ul><li> And in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em>, with "the collapse of the Treaty of Insects."
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> When Sci-Fi Channel decided to get rid of their nerdy image by renaming themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Syfy">Syfy</a> they didn't do a simple text search of foreign dictionaries. It's Polish for acne and also the plural of "syf", which is Polish slang for "syphilis". And that's why the Polish channel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiteTheWaxTadpole">was left unchanged</a>.
</li><li> (All transliterated:) The Hebrew word "Oti" means "me". The Hebrew word "mi" means "who?". The Hebrew word "hu" (pronounced "who") means "he". And the Hebrew word "he" means "she".
<ul><li> All of this makes a lot more sense if you're aware of their Arabic cognates, which sound less like the English words: Hebrew "mi"=Arabic "men"; "hu"="huwa"; and "he"="hiya."
</li><li> He, Shi, Mi, and Yu are all valid surnames in Mandarin Chinese. Hence the statement, "He is Shi, she is He, you are Mi, and I am Yu."
<ul><li> Though "He" is pronounced sort of like "Huh" and "Shi" is pronounced similarly to "Sure". Though the surname "Xi" is pronounced sort of like "She", which invites all sorts of "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao">Hu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s the president of China? No, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping">Xi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s the president of China!" jokes.
</li></ul></li><li> Same thing with modern German, which has the same origins as modern English: "Wer?" means "who?". "Wo?" means "where?". "Wenn" actually means "if" (or "when", see below), but "wen?" means "whom?".
<ul><li> The word "wenn" means "when" or "if" in subordinate clauses ("Wir treffen uns, wenn die Uhr 12 schlägt" - "We meet when the clock strikes 12"), but the interrogative "when?" is "wann?" in German. Similarly, "will" means "want" in English (related to the other English sense "it is my will that..."), rather than "it will happen".
</li></ul></li><li> And even more so with Dutch. 'Wie' (pronounced like English 'we') in Dutch is 'who', while in German it translates to 'how'. 'Hoe' (pronounced like 'who') translates to 'how' (German 'wie'). 'Waar' is Dutch for 'where', 'war' is German for 'was,' both are pronounced like the word that denotes a violent and potentially deadly conflict in English. 'Was' (German for 'what') translates to either 'wash', the first person singular past of 'to be', or 'wax' in Dutch.
</li><li> On the same note (emotionally) "sensitive" is "sensibel" in German, while "sensible" translates to "vernünftig".
<ul><li> Although "sensible" can also have the same meaning in English, hence <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Odd and Randi are perfectly normal Norwegian names...
<ul><li> Randy is a normal name in the US too, but it'll raise some eyebrows (or cause fits of uncontrollable sniggering) in the UK.
<ul><li> The word "snigger" itself will likely elicit cries of "racism" in the US.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Spanish, <em>embarazada</em> means <em>pregnant</em>, not "embarrassed".
</li><li> There is an Austrian village by the name of <em><strong><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fucking,_Austria">Fucking<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></strong></em>, whose residents used to spend surprisingly large amounts of money on replacing stolen road signs until they ended up putting a sign made of concrete.
<ul><li> A beer named "Fucking Hell" has appeared, its name referring to this place and its color, "hell" meaning "light" or "pale".
</li><li> There is a different town in Australia called "Eromanga". In Japanese, "ero manga" (erotic manga) are risqué or outright explicit comics. (Which makes it funnier when it's discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiFlamenco">Samurai Flamenco</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/EromangaSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/EromangaSensei">Eromanga Sensei</a></em>.)
</li><li> Austria also has a town called "Windpassing".
</li></ul></li><li> Someone in Honda discovered that "fitta" means female genitals in Norwegian and Swedish. Fortunately for Honda, this was before Honda's new hatchback subcompact car went on the market, and Honda had time to rename it to "Fit" or "Jazz" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarketBasedTitle">depending on the market</a>.

<ul><li> There is the Slavic folk dance called "horo" (or "kolo", depending on the nation).

Why? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">His name just so happens to be (admittedly broken) Portuguese for "fucking for free."</a>
</li><li> "Gift" means poison in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and German (Modern German usage derives from the word 'gift'-as-in-present being used as euphemism for poison in the Middle Ages.).
<ul><li> In Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish, it means both 'poison' and 'married'. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Make of that what you will</a>.

A bilingual reader wrote to the letters page and pointed out that, in French, this sounds exactly like "mettre au cul", or "shove it up the arse".
</li><li> Russian and Hebrew have somewhat similar phonetics, especially when the speaker has a Russian / Eastern European accent, which is often the case. This renders mundane Hebrew phrases like "worried about losing eligibility for a postdated check" or "new tabernacles (sukkot) will be built" virtually <em>unprintable</em> in Russian. And Russian is not exactly the language of prudes...
<ul><li> In fact, the Hebrew word for 'Ugly' is also unprintable.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LatinLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LatinLanguage">Latin</a> is a serial offender. "Labia" means "lips". In English, "labia" only refers to the "lips" of lady parts. The original Latin word and its meaning are preserved in Spanish "labios" and Portuguese "lábios". The English word for lip is from the same Proto-Indo-European root, just through Proto-Germanic.
<ul><li> In Portuguese, "labia" can also mean "meaningless conversation". In Spanish, to have "labia" means to have a way with words.
</li><li> Most non-slang words for genitalia were dirty jokes/slang/euphemisms in Latin, which eventually became the standard terms. Along with "labia" (lips) there are "penis" (tail), "vagina" (scabbard), "anus" (ring/circle), etc.
</li><li> In German, "Scheide" can mean <em>both</em> "scabbard" and "vagina".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EcceRomani" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EcceRomani">One particular Latin textbook</a> had a recurring character known as "Sextus".

</li></ul></li><li> The word "douche" is used to refer <em>exclusively</em> to a "vaginal wash" in American English. In about a dozen other languages and the UK, it still has its original meaning of "shower". (Words that sound like "shower", meanwhile, tend to mean "rainfall" in some Germanic languages.)

<ul><li> A lot of older Danish movies will also end on that jolly note. Also, "service elevator" is "Godselevator".

<ul><li> And in Germany, "Ausfahrt" appears on signs for highway exits.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note192mo0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note192mo0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note192mo0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">From aus, "out", and fahren, "to drive"</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is part of the reason the Welsh prophet/bard Myrddin became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">Merlin</a>. The original name sounded a bit like "merde", which means "shit" in French, the native tongue of English nobility at the time, but in their <em>literary</em> language, Latin, the resemblance is much more striking—the Latinized version <em>Merdinus</em> literally means "Little Shitman" (<em>merda</em> = "shit" + diminutive <em>-in-</em> + masculine nominative <em>-us</em>). Changing D to L gave the less offensive "Merlinus", which became "Merlin" in English.
</li><li> In Denmark, a timetable will likely be labelled "fartplan".
</li><li> A popular Iranian cleaning product is called "Barf", the Persian word for snow.
</li><li> In Italy, Brasil, Spain, France and Portugal when a toast is made it's common to say "cin cin!"/"tim tim"/"chin chin" (pronounced "cheen cheen" -an onomatopoeia for the sound of glasses clinking together). In Japan, doing this would be very unfortunate, as "chinchin" is a childish word for "penis".
<ul><li> The same goes in Mexican Spanish: <em>Chinchin</em> sounds like you're cursing twice. (as ¡Chin, Chin!, translated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Damn it, DAMN IT!</a>)
</li><li> In Nigeria, there is a snack called chin chin.
</li></ul></li><li> A non-dirty example: in some (all?) <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> works that get translated to French, half the characters' names are changed to reflect differences in pronounciation. Luke and Leia are left alone, but Han becomes Yan (because in French, the h is silent, so "Han" would sound like "Anne", not a sufficiently masculine name for that guy) and the chosen names of Sith change from Darth to Dark (because French has no th sound, so people would just pronounce it like "dart", and at least "dark" is appropriate in English).
<ul><li> Additionally, Count Dooku had to have his name changed in the Portuguese releases because "Dooku" is pronounced identically to "do cu" which means "from the ass".
</li><li> Actually, in French it is not unknown for men to have "Marie" or "Anne" among their first names, the real problem with "Han" in French is probably that with its long "a" it is in danger of being pronounced like "âne" (donkey, ass).
</li></ul></li><li> Another non-dirty example involves a German pastor giving a Christmas guest sermon in South Africa. He made a valiant attempt at Afrikaans, too; unfortunately, this led to him saying that the shepherds were watching over their flocks by night, "en toe word die hele hemel hel" (and then all of Heaven turned into Hell). What he meant to say was, "en toe word die hele hemel <em>helder</em>" (and then the sky became bright). The confusion occurred because "Chell" is German for "bright".
</li><li> The name "Jude" means "jew" in German, turning the Beatles song title into "Hey Jew".
<ul><li> In English countries "Jude" is typically understood as someone who practices Judaism, and does not directly refer to a Jew (this being because it is possible for someone of another faith to convert). However, given Germany's history...
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Jude, two of Jesus' disciples shared the name Judas: Judas Iscariot and Judas Thaddeus. In English, the guy that didn't betray Jesus is called Jude, while the other one is called Judas. Spanish makes no such distinction, with both being called Judas (Tadeo and Iscariote). Cue fundamentalists pointing out Latin-American parishes named San Judas as proof that Catholics are evil.
</li><li> Condoleezza Rice's first name causes endless mirth among Czechs, "kunda" being a dirty word for female privates and "lízat" meaning "to lick". Newscasters refer to her simply as "Riceová" or "the [former] American secretary of state".
<ul><li> In Chinese media she used usually referred to on the news as "US secretary of state Rice", the problem being her surname, especially since Chinese languages tend to substitute R sounds for L, sounds like "to shit" (so it sounds like "US secretary of state shitted") in Mandarin, and is somehow <em>even worse</em> in Cantonese, in which it sounds like "to shit uncontrollably".
</li><li> The same goes in Spanish, as "Condoleezza" sounds like "Condolencia" (condolence).
</li></ul></li><li> The webpage of a Canadian sociology professor, Ziva Kunda, has become legendary among Czech and Slovak internet users. "Kunda" is a variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">Country Matters</a> and "ivá" means "living" — incidentally, Ziva Kunda herself died in 2004. Ms. Kunda was apparently aware of the source of her popularity in that part of the world and did not find it funny.
</li><li> Obviously, the Estonian town of Kunda is also very popular with Czechs.
</li><li> In Japanese, "kuma" means "bear". In Swahili, it's a vulgar slang term for vagina.
</li><li> One book by Fritz Spiegl relates the story of how, in the Second World War, the obvious thing to do with the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories was to abbreviate it to AMGOT. Unfortunately this turned out to mean something unprintable in Turkish and the abbreviation was hastily changed to "AMG". In a footnote, Spiegl adds that none of the Turks he knew was prepared to tell him what the meaning was. One, after he had finished laughing, said "no such word", which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">strictly accurate</a> — it's two rude words joined together.
</li><li> English "pedo" (shorthand for "pedophile"), Spanish <em>pedo</em> ("fart").
</li><li> The Dutch word for "removable" is "demontabel."
</li><li> To Americans, "bimbo" (pronounced /bɪm.boʊ/) is a derogatory thing to call a woman. To Mexicans, who pronounce it as /bim.bo/, it's the name of their country's largest food corporation and a colloquial term for for "bread", much like Kleenex is for tissues.
<ul><li> That brand of bread is available in the US; the label includes 'Say BEEM-bo' on it under the name.
</li><li> In German, "Bimbo" can be a derogatory term for an African, or a servant or general dogsbody.
</li><li> Any wonder why the Bimbo company, also a major bakery in the U.S., mainly make Arnold or Oroweat bread?
</li><li> While in Japanese, bimbo (na) means "poor" (not having money).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note20tht3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note20tht3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note20tht3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although, due to the many ways to romanize Japanese, it sounds like that...but it might not be written that way.</span>
</li><li> The fun part? "Bimbo" comes from the Italian word for "kid".
</li></ul></li><li> The word for "Emergency" in German is "Not". Emergency exits are thus labeled <em>Notausgang</em>.
</li><li> Polish, Czech and Slovak: These languages are generally similar enough for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualDialogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualDialogue">Bilingual Dialogue</a> to work, but the differences can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">amusing</a> misunderstandings.
<ul><li> For example the Polish word <em>szukać</em> (to look for) sounds a lot like a Czech word meaning <em>to fuck</em>. This has led to the following situation: A little Czech girl got lost somewhere in Poland. When she was finally found, she was apparently "intimidated by the language barrier". Especially after being told everyone's been looking for her.
<ul><li> In fact, this happens even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">between modern Czech and classic 19th century Czech literary works</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> "Zachód" in Polish means <em>west</em>, but in Czech and Slovak "záchod" means <em>a toilet</em>. They're both derived from root words meaning <em>to go down</em>.
</li><li> Czerstwy chleb in Polish means "old bread" while in many Slavic languages it means "fresh." Further confusing in Polish "czerstwy staruszek" (staruszek means "old man") which means he is in good form rather than bad.
<ul><li> In Russian, "Cherstvy", when applied to a person, means "coldhearted".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Orava with a capital "o" is the name of one of Slovakia's northwest historical regions. In Finnish, orava means "squirrel", causing laughter for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyNarrowSuperlative">all Slovak learners of Finnish from Orava</a>.
</li><li> German tourists in Egypt occasionally got in trouble for saying the word <em>Kuss</em>—in German, it means a kiss, but in Arabic, it means, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">Country Matters</a>.
</li><li> Arabic-language news media (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlJazeera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlJazeera">Al Jazeera</a>) were put in a bind when Jean-Marc Ayrault was appointed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchPoliticalSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FrenchPoliticalSystem">Prime Minister of France</a>—you see, "Ayrault" pronounced in the French fashion (i.e. "air-oh") is one small sound away from sounding like <em>`ayruh</em>, which is Levantine<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21dc5r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21dc5r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21dc5r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lebanese/Syrian/Palestinian/Jordanian</span> Arabic for "his dick/cock/[insert vulgar word for male genitalia here]". They elected to pronounce the "lt" to avoid the problem...earning the ire of certain Arab intellectuals, many of whom are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCultureFetish">fans of the French</a>.
<ul><li> In the opposite direction (more or less), a fairly classical way of insulting someone in Arabic is to call them "nājis'', i.e. ritually impure. In colloquial use, where it is usually pronounced nijis, it's come to mean either someone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigpen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigpen">who's just generally dirty</a> or those whose habits you find unpleasant (it's often used to not-so-subtly imply that the target frequents whorehouses). In most dialects, this doesn't cause any funny business, but in Egypt, where the "j" is pronounced as a "g", it comes out as "nigis", which English-speakers might hear as...well...let's just say black Americans visiting Egypt have gotten suitably offended, but not in the way the Egyptian meant it to.
</li><li> Najis also happens to mean "excrement" in Malay (no doubt the word was mis-appropriated when Malacca was trading with the Arabs in the 14th century and absorbed some of the words). This is why many of the corrupt prime minister Najib Razak's detractors and critics are calling him this.
</li></ul></li><li> Not dirty but still amusing: In the Korean martial arts style Tang Soo Do, a bo staff (a long, smooth staff intended for striking) is referred to as a bong.
</li><li> The title of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Wales">First Minister of Wales<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in Welsh is "Prif Weinidog Cymru." That's right. "Minister" in Welsh sounds <em>exactly</em> like "whiny dog."
</li><li> Lakota examples:
<ul><li> The names Che and Sean sound like [cɛ] and [ʃã], meaning "penis" and "vagina". The words aren't considered "dirty", but still...
</li><li> Not really dirty, but cola sounds like [kʰola], "friend". This also applies to coda, due to the inherent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Spell My Name with an "S"</a> of Sioux languages.
</li><li> Really complicated one: Kanji sounds like [kãgi], "crow". Not much, until you remember <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotCrows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotCrows">what crow is synonymous with in Kansai-ben</a>.
</li><li> Conversely, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrineTrouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrineTrouble">pi</a> means "liver".
</li></ul></li><li> Linguists use the following pseudo-French nursery rhyme to indicate the difficulty of parsing language when unsure which language is being spoken:
<div class="indent"> Homme petit d'homme petit, s'attend, n'avale <br/>Homme petit d'homme petit, à degrés de bègues folles <br/>Anal deux qui noeuds ours, anal deux qui noeuds s'y mènent <br/>Coup d'un poux tome petit tout guetteur à gaine
</div></li><li> Inverted by English and Afrikaans with the sentences <em>My pen is in my hand</em> and <em>My hand is in warm water</em>, which are both written the same way and mean the same thing, but <em>sound</em> rather different. (And for a bonus, both languages know about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithPenIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProblemWithPenIsland">The Problem with Pen Island</a></em>.)
</li><li> In German, "Depp" means "idiot", usually of the rural variety, as in "Dorfdepp" ("village idiot"). Germans laugh more at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnnyDepp">Johnny Depp</a> acting like a fool as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Captain Jack</a>. Reportedly, Johnny Depp has found it hilarious.
</li><li> "This isn't a library!" Except in French/Spanish/Portuguese/Italian a <em>librairie</em>/<em>librería</em>/<em>livreria</em>/<em>libreria</em> is a bookshop, and a library is called a <em>bibliothèque</em>/<em>biblioteca</em>/<em>biblioteca</em>/<em>biblioteca</em>.
</li><li> The last name of the Russian president <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VladimirPutin">Vladimir Putin</a> is an endless source of comedy for many people from Spanish-speaking countries, since <em>Putin</em> is similar to the Spanish slur <em>puto</em> (Spanish for either <em>faggot</em> or the masculine form of "whore"). In fact, supposedly when Mr. Putin traveled to Mexico for a work tour as a President, the Mexican spokesman struggled to avoid laughing hard when presenting him to the Mexican audience.
<ul><li> One ad from SKY Mexico during the 2018 World Cup played on this: at the end, the small crowd in the set began the infamous "ehh, puuutoo" chant, before the host suddenly stops halfway, gives a military salute, and says, "Putin?"
</li><li> It's worse in French: <em>putain</em> (one-letter difference, and pronounced basically the same) means "whore" or "bitch", used as an expletive for "fucking". As a result, French language authorities have resorted to spelling his name "Poutine", which makes some sense (it produces the closest possible French equivalent to how it's pronounced in Russian), but is also <em>exactly</em> the name of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poutine">a Canadian dish of French fries served with cheese curds and hot gravy<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Made even better by a scandal involving a party calling voters intending to vote for another party telling them their voting station has been changed ... to the address of a Poutine store. Cue political cartoons about voter's oppression in Russia under the foot of Putin (not that there has been a lot, just a little more on the socialist side) comparing voter's oppression in Canada under a box of Poutine.
</li><li> Inevitably, a restaurant named Vladimir Poutine opened in Montreal in 2017.
</li></ul></li><li> Another Polish one: <em>tampon</em> means any bit of cotton wadding, particularly in medical or dental use. So the possibilities for mirth are endless when a language textbook openly talks about Ela going to the dentist and putting a <em>tampon</em> in her mouth.
<ul><li> In hungarian <em>koton</em> (pronounced the same as cotton) exclusively means condom, elementary schooolers learn this word quite fast, of course. Cotton in hungarian is either <em>vatta</em> for the wadding or <em>gyapot</em> for the plant.
</li></ul></li><li> Be careful travelling to Korea in the winter. 'Shiver' sounds very close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">something else there.</a>
</li><li> There is a town near Manchester, England, called Sale. It tried to twin with a comparable town in France but got no offers. From a French point of view, who wants their town twinned with somewhere called <em>Dirty</em>? Especially when an extension of the word in French swearing is <em>sale con</em>, or <em>dirty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">cunt</a></em>....
</li><li> English "pawpaw" [ˈpɔːˌpɔː], a fruit similar to a papaya (also a euphimism for "Grandfather" in some parts of the US), sounds like German "Popo", "butt".
</li><li> An example of this trope across two dialects of French; in French, the slang term for "children" is "gosses". In Quebec French, the same word is the slang term for "testicles".
</li><li> The French word for "late" is "en retard". To English speakers learning French, "en" sounds very much like "un" (the indefinite article), so "Je suis en retard" ("I am running late") sounds an awful lot like "I'm a retard".
</li><li> Teaching 11-year old French students about English irregular verbs can be... patience-testing, at best. Amongst the first verbs on the list? Bite and burn, which read with a French accent, sound like cock and balls.
</li><li> <em>Fit</em> in Swiss German translates to something like 'awake' or 'mentally present'.
</li><li> The Swedish word <em>svalka</em> means 'coolness' and has pleasant connotations, so Ikea named a series of drinking glasses Svalka. Unfortunately, Ikea also operates in Russia, and in Russian <em>сва́лка</em> (<em>svalka</em>) means 'garbage dump'. The Russian Ikea renamed the glasses to <em>Свальк</em> (<em>svalk</em>), resorting to using a soft <em>l</em> in order to make the words look different.
</li><li> The Russian word for boxwood is <em>самши́т</em> [sɐˈmʂɨt], like English "some shit" [ˌsɐm　ˈʃɪtʰ].
<ul><li> The Russian word for "sew" also sounds awfully like "shit" in English.
<ul><li> So does the word for "shield".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In many Slavic languages (for example Russian, Polish, Slovak, Serbian, Croatian), the word for "brother" is "brat" or, in Cyrillic, <em>"брат"</em> (pronounced more like the first syllable of "bratwurst" though). English speakers with annoying siblings are usually fairly amused by this.
</li><li> "Knikker" is the Dutch word for "marble",the children's toy not the stone,but resembles British English <em>knicker</em>.
</li><li> In American Sign Language, the sign for "vagina" is made by holding your hands flat, fingers together, thumbs extended, and the tips of the thumbs and forefingers touching. Now think of how many times you've seen a hearing person making that sign or a close variation of it when they don't know what else to do with their hands. Notable example: Michelle Obama on the cover of the Dec 2011/Jan 2012 <em>Reader's Digest</em>.
</li><li> Great fun tricking new students of Russian into saying the phrase "brave (smelliy) like (kahk) sugar (sahar)" ("smelly cock sucker").
</li><li> Yakimanka is a street in Moscow. In Japanese, it sounds like "Fried Cunt".
</li><li> Yama is Russian for "pit". And Japanese for "mountain".
<ul><li> There is even an old Russian joke about a Japanese racecar driver named Toyama Tokanawa. "To yama to kanava" in Russian means something like "either a pit or a gully" (i.e. the guy can't drive straight).
</li></ul></li><li> "Kaka" means "cake" in Swedish. The first A is pronounced more like an "O" sound.
<ul><li> To German ears it sounds like a child's word for "poo".
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Sora</em> is the Japanese word for "sky" and the Finnish word for "gravel".
</li><li> The word written <em>sein</em> means "to be" in German and "breast" in French.
<ul><li> And it sounds somewhat like the Hebrew word <em>zayin</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22cbej');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22cbej" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22cbej');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">זַיִן</span>, which can mean "the seventh letter of the Hebrew alphabet", "arms" (as in weapons), or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">cock</a>".
</li><li> One wonders if this is what draws some Israeli or Jewish fans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/OneDirection">One Direction</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23b32t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23b32t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23b32t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Zayn Malik, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">get it?</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> Israelis with the name Itai or Shiri (masculine and feminine first names, respectively) are often embarrassed to find out their names mean painful and butt respectively in Japanese.
</li><li> In the same way, if you're Japanese and your last name is <em>Sakamoto</em>, <em>Yamamoto</em> or <em>Ito</em>, get ready for being the butt of all jokes in the Spanish-speaking world, since Sakamoto sounds like <em>saca moto</em> (<em>getting out [your] motorcyle</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24pnas');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24pnas" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24pnas');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Moto" is short for "motocicleta"</span>) and Yamamoto like <em>llama moto</em> (<em>calling your motorcycle</em>). <em>Señor Ito</em> (<em>Mr. Ito</em>) sounds like <em>señorito</em> (a corny <em>Young Master</em>).
<ul><li> This is even more funnier for the name of a famous Japanese brand of monosodium glutamate named <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajinomoto">Ajinomoto<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, since it sounds like <em>Alli No Moto</em>. (Broken Spanish for <em>Don't Park Your Motorcycle There</em>)
<ul><li> Ajinomoto is also a common joke in Malaysian Pidgin English. Literally, meaning that the Hajj pilgrim does not own a motorcycle <em>(Haji no motor)</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact, Japanese names are an eternal source for cheap laughs in Spanish, due to how many of them can sound like naughty or weird stuff in Spanish. For example, the name of the author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Log Horizon</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MaoyuuMaouYuusha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MaoyuuMaouYuusha">Maoyuu Maou Yuusha</a></em> light novels, <em>Mamare Touno</em>. His name in Spanish sounds like <em>Mamaré Todo</em>, as in <em>(I will) suck everything</em>.
</li><li> A few female Japanese names has also this effect, like <em>Rie</em> (to laugh), <em>Risa</em> (laugh), <em>Maya</em> (as the Mayans, the ancient Mesoamerican tribe. It's also a proper name in some western countries as well), <em>Nako</em> (Mexican slang for a <em>male</em> hillbilly), any name ending or beginning with either <em>Kago</em> or <em>Kaga</em> (I shit and (s)he shits, respectively), etc.
</li><li> And if you're Japanese and your last name is Asō (or Asou/Asoh), expect more than a few raised eyebrows in The Netherlands; Aso is a Dutch slang term for a rude, antisocial person.
</li></ul></li><li> Brazilian Portuguese also offers many examples.
<ul><li> The name of Brazilian soccer player <em>Kaká</em> sounds almost the same (without the accent) as the Latin form used in many other Romance languages (Spanish and French mainly) to say <em>crap</em>.
<ul><li> In Rome's dialect it sounds like the verb "to shit". Cue tons of jokes when Kaká was playing in AC Milan and Totti, then captain of the Roma who speaks <em>exclusively</em> in his dialect, announced before a game that he didn't fear him.
</li></ul></li><li> If you think that was bad, there was another Brazilian player who played along the aforementioned Kaká named <em>Elano</em>, whose name in Spanish sounds exactly like <em>The anus</em>, causing any mention of his name along Kaká into instant comedy.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note255rff');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note255rff" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note255rff');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Two of the most famous mentions of their names in Spanish were <em>Kaká le pica Elano</em> (Kaká spikes the ball towards Elano, but sounds like "Poop itchs the anus" or "Kaká's anus itches"), and <em>Kaká sale por Elano</em> (Kaká is replaced by Elano, but it sounds like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">Poop goes outside the anus</a>)".</span>
</li><li> And there's another Brazilian player who played in Denmark named <em>Cacá</em> (with C rather than K). To make the things even more unfortunate for him (at least for a Spanish-speaker) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName">he is black</a>.
</li><li> While technically Portuguese, Thiago Motta, another soccer player, counts. His name sounds like <em>I make weed (for you)</em>.
</li><li> Another Brazilian soccer player, <em>Borracha</em> (real name: João Fernandes Oliveira), sounds the same as the Mexican Spanish word for <em>drunken woman</em>. The player is <em>male</em>.
<ul><li> And there's another Brazilian player named <em>Junior Borracha</em> (real name: Enivaldo Manoel do Carmo Júnior).
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Pelé</em> sounds the same as the past form of the Spanish word for <em>To peel something</em> and also as a Mexican slang for both <em>to escape</em> and <em>to give a damn</em>. Another former Brazilian star, <em>Tostao</em> sounds like Mexican accented Portuguese for <em>toasted</em>.
</li><li> Alexandre Pato, yet another Brazilian soccer player, is another unfortunate example, at least in Puerto Rican Spanish: While Pato is normally translated as "duck", in Puerto Rico his surname is a local slang for "fag".
</li><li> In an non-Spanish example, there is a former Brazilian player and currently manager named <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argel_Fucks">Argel Fucks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (last name pronounced "foocks"), which caused some hilarity in English-speaking media, especially on some headlines, being the most hilarious one "Fucks off to Benfica". This is one of the reasons he is normally addressed by his first name instead.
</li></ul></li><li> Other foreign soccer players had funny-sounding names in Spanish besides Portuguese ones:
<ul><li> Italian soccer player Simone Vergassola's surname is quite... problematic to pronounce in Spanish, especially in the Mexican dialect, because it sounds like <em>solitary cock</em>.
</li><li> Another Italian, Christian Panucci, is also problematic to spell in Mexico, as his surname sounds disturbingly close to "panocha" which is a very vulgar slang for the women's nether parts.
</li><li> Romanian soccer player Bănel Nicoliţă's surname sounds similar if pronounced without diacritics to "mi colita", which is translated as "my dick" (Spain) and "My ass" (Mexico and many Latin American countries).
</li><li> Ciprian Marica, another Romanian player, is even worse, as his surname means "fag" in Spain and "coward" in Mexico, albeit it also means the same as in Spain. This is the reason <a class="urllink" href="https://www.marca.com/2013/10/02/futbol/equipos/getafe/1380701015.html">he played with his name on his shirt instead of his surname during his time at Getafe CF in Spain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Patxi Puñal, a Spaniard player of Basque origin, has his surname means as both "dagger" in Spain and also a vulgar slang for a gay person in Mexico.
</li><li> Cameroon-born player Pierre Webó's surname sounds similar to "huevo", as both "egg" and also the slang for "testicles".
</li></ul></li><li> In a similar topic, there's no shortage of cities and towns in Spain with funny-sounding names, due to the many languages spoken in that country, so this trope applies to them:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venta_de_Ba%C3%B1os">Venta de Baños<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a small city in the Palencia province, sounds exactly as "Bathroom Sales" in Spanish. The name came from the Ancient Spanish word for "village" for the word "venta", which was near to Baños de Cerrato, another Spaniard town.
</li><li> El Meadero de la Reina: (Literally, "The Queen's Pissdump"), an small slum near Puerto Real, in Cadiz. The name came from when the then-Queen Isabel II decided to make an emergency stop there to pee in that place. Originally it was named <em>El descansadero de la venta caída</em> (The Resting Place of the Downed Village), but after that event, the place changed its name.
</li><li> Villapene (lit. "Penisville"). Named after a Roman soldier named Penus who lived there. Located in Galicia.
</li><li> Parderrubias: (lit. "A couple of blondies"). Another Galician town. Notable because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinSheen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinSheen">Martin Sheen</a>'s father, Francisco Estévez Martínez, hailed from there.
</li><li> Guarromán (lit. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigPen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePigPen">Dirtyman</a>"). A small town from the Andalucia province. Ironically enough, the name is a adaptation of its original Arabic name, Uādī-r-Rommān, (River of Pomegranates), but for some bizarre reason it was translated to that name. Their residents are very aware of how funny the name of their town sounds and they love to make fun of it.
</li><li> Probably the most hilarious (or offensive) one, especially for Spanish speakers from outside Spain and especially Mexico, would be a small town in Catalonia named "Berga" (with B, while the Latin American word is normally spelled with a "V", but the pronounciation is the same) which means invariably as "cock", causing lots of hilarity among Mexicans when someone asks if they travelled there, as the answer invariably would be in Spanish "Fui a Berga" (I went to Berga), but if you add the article "la", it would sound like "me fui a la Berga" (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">I went to fuck myself</a>/I went to hell). This is even worse if you use the Spanish translation of the Catalonian name, "Ciutat de Berga" (Berga City), as interpreted in Mexican Spanish would be "Ciudad de verga" (Shitty city/Shantytown). In Spain the word itself doesn't mean anything there and they found weird when they see many Mexican tourists <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HehHehYouSaidX">laughing like hyenas at hearing that name</a>.
</li><li> In fact, Spain had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">thousands of towns</a> with these names, some vary from the most common (La Pera, Ajo, Maria, etc), to the more unusual (Malcocinado<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26cxxj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26cxxj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26cxxj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Badly cooked</span>, Dios Le Guarde<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note277ipa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note277ipa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note277ipa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">God protects you.</span>, Humilladero<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note28rae1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note28rae1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note28rae1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Humiliating place</span>) and even the most offensive ones (Seno<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note291cgv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note291cgv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note291cgv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Breast</span>, Alcantarilla<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note30r9tm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note30r9tm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note30r9tm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Sewer</span>, El Pito<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31uul9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31uul9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31uul9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Dick, or in some dialects, The Horn.</span>, Calamocos<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note328wqh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note328wqh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note328wqh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NauseaFuel">Snot Tester</a></span> and the already mentioned towns.)
</li></ul></li><li> The fairly rare Israeli last name Pines (pronounced pea-ness). Notable cases include:
<ul><li> Israeli artist <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Pins">Yaakov Pines<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note33zpwp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note33zpwp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note33zpwp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, the article says Pins, but Hebrew never has word-final consonant clusters, unless its a morphemic /-t/. Its complicated.</span>. He mentioned how a reporter once asked him very politely whether he should change his name. I gave him, that gentile, a proper answer: that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyMissingThePoint">"Yaakov" was a fine Hebrew name!</a>
</li><li> Ofir Pines-Paz, Israeli politician, who was made Minister of Interior.
</li><li> Guy Pines, host of a popular entertainment news show, who often interviews Hollywood celebrities. He often checks into hotels saying his names is Pines (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPAY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItIsPronouncedTroPAY">pronouncing it as the plural of pine tree</a>), and when he told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JuliaRoberts">Julia Roberts</a> his name was Guy Pines, she said hers was Woman Vagina.
</li></ul></li><li> Continuing with Hebrew, "Thank you very much" is translated as "Toda Raba". For Japanese speakers, the whole expression would sound funny, since "Toda" is also a valid Japanese surname, making some names, such as Japanese voice actress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeikoToda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeikoToda">Keiko Toda</a>, sound funny for Hebrew speakers, especially when spelled using the Asian order, since it would sound like saying "Thank you, Keiko" in Hebrew, and "Keiko, thank you" when using her name in the western order.
<ul><li> In Spanish, "Toda Raba" would sound, when changing the gender of the words to male, to "Todo (el) Rabo", i.e. "All the Tail/Ass", through in some dialects, it also sounds like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssShove">All (the) Dick"</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The high-IQ group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mensa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Mensa">Mensa</a> chose its name because it means "table" in Latin, symbolizing the coming together of equals, but didn't foresee a Mexican chapter of Mensa... and <em>mensa</em> means "<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34l6ht');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note34l6ht" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34l6ht');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">female</span>moron" in Mexican Spanish. "¿Eres mensa?" means "Are you dumb?".
<dl><dd><ul><li> It probably is not coincidental that "Mensa" also contains the Latin word <em>mens</em> = "mind".
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> While not in dictionaries <em>Mensa</em> can be interpreted as the verb <em>menstruate</em> in Swedish; the contextual overlap is nonexistent but will produce a snicker or two should the club be brought up in an elementary school.
</li><li> In German-speaking universities, a <em>Mensa</em> (plural: <em>Mensen</em>) is a students' canteen, also from the Latin for "table", since Latin used to be the language of academics.
</li><li> It's a students' canteen in Italian schools as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The former Prime Minister of Finland, Esko Aho, would have had problems with his surname both in Spain and in Japan. While <em>aho</em> means "meadow" in Finnish, it would mean "garlic" (<em>ajo</em>, pronounced a-ho) in Spanish, and "idiot" in Japanese.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35f3n0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35f3n0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35f3n0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In Japanese's case, it only means that in certain dialects.</span>
</li><li> In Japanese, the word for "day-care worker in a kindergarten, nursery school, etc." is pronounced "<em>Hobo</em>" (保母), which is not exactly a type of person an American would want watching their little ones.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3600mx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3600mx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3600mx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's read like the starts of "hole" and "ball" (in that order) though, so while it can be written that way in romaji, it's actually not that funny.</span>
</li><li> Italian <em>penne</em> (a kind of pasta) sounds like the Spanish word <em>pene</em> (<em>penis</em>), also an endless source for dirty jokes, especially when the aforementionated dish is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo">cooked</a>.
<ul><li> "Pene" is the Italian word for "penis" too, but since Italian distinguishes between short and long consonants ("penne" having a longer-sounding "n") there is no innuendo<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note37ckwc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note37ckwc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note37ckwc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">if you're curious about the meaning, "penne" is the feminine plural of "penna", "pen", because the pasta vaguely resembles one. "Pene" - the word for penis - is masculine and singular, and the plural would be "peni". Yes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Italian plurals are complicated</a></span>.
</li><li> In the early 90s, the forward of Valencia CF was made of Bulgarian Penev, Spanish Poyatos and Brazilian Viola. The three sound the same, or very close in Spanish to "penis", "cock" and "(he) rapes". The Spanish comedy site <em>Viruete</em> refers to this as the time Valencia played ballsy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PenelopeCruz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PenelopeCruz">Penélope Cruz</a> is sometimes shortened to "Pene" in America. Not so in Spain.
</li></ul></li><li> Czech/Slovak/Polish/German <em>fakt</em> and Russian <em>факт</em> (meaning <em>fact</em>) is pronounced [fäkt] with open central vowel, like <em>fucked</em> in Australian English. The Czech word is often used to ask "is that a fact?" or "really?". Many a foreigner felt offended. In Czech and Polish the answer "Fakt." means something like "It's true." <a class="urllink" href="http://www.soundcomparisons.com/">Tables for "ash" and "honey" here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suggest that <em>fact</em> /fækt/ in some English dialects may be pronounced like <em>fucked</em> /fʌkt/ in others - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage">Separated by a Common Language</a>?
</li><li> The Finnish poet Eino Leino is popular among Czechs though sadly not because they would be fans or great scholars of his work. It is his name that is well-loved, being a mix between an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Awesome McCoolname</a> and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateName">Unfortunate Name</a>. The rhyming itself is irresistible, but there is more. Eino is close enough to the Czech interjection "ejhle", which means "lo and behold", while Leino sounds exactly like "lejno", and that is a word for excrement.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoeBiden">Joe Biden</a>'s middle name is Robinette, which sounds like a feminized version of the French word for "water tap", "robinet" (pronounced [ʁobine]).
</li><li> The Russian name Серге́й (Sergey, [sʲɪˈrʲɡʲej]) sounds like Spanish <em>ser gay</em> [sɛr　ɡej], "to be gay". Now imagine that your last name is also Putin (little faggot).
</li><li> In Finland, the word "home" means "mold" (as in fungus). Home videos with English texts used to cause much hilarity to kids back in the video era.
</li><li> There is a certain species of bird whose French name is "coq de roche". Unfortunately, it is <em>far</em> too easy to translate this to "rock cock".
</li><li> In french, "intercours" means " the five minute between two class periods (or, for some teachers, between two hours of the same course") and not sexual relation.
</li><li> The first line of the chorus of Greek Cypriot singer Mixalis Xatzigiannis' song "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0IqYoOUiZU">Pies<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" means in Greek (paraphrased): <em>Drink! Drink to the bottom!</em> but to a Spanish speaker it sounds like: <em>Feet! Have you tasted feet?</em>.
</li><li> In Hungarian, the last name of Ferdinand <em>Foch</em> (French marshal during WWI) means "(liquid) shit".
<ul><li> In a similar vein, Mario <em>Puzo</em> sounds like "farting Mario". In the same way, in Spanish, Mario Puzo sounds like <em>Mario Puso</em> (Mario put that...)
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Barack</em> means apricot/peach in Hungarian. Now, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">a certain American politician</a> was elected president...
</li><li> <em>Piña</em> means pineapple in Spanish, in Hungarian <em>pina</em> refers to female genitals (also used as a harsh insult). When it comes to the cocktail, hungarians rarely pronounce it the spanish way.
</li><li> <em>Kuss</em> means kiss in german, in hungarian <em>Kuss!</em> (pronounced like kushsh), means <em>Shut up!</em>
</li><li> Hungarian word for "tree" is "fa", and, following grammatic rules, plural of that ("trees") would be "fák", which is pronounced almost exactly as you imagine.
</li><li> Non-obscene example from Hungarian: "uborka" means "cucumber", and Russian word "уборка", which sounds the same, generally means "cleaning".
</li><li> Generally hungarian humour uses a lot of wordplays like this. A well known what is "How is (worker of a certain profession) called in (certain laguage)?
<ul><li> Example: How do you call an innkeeper in greek? -Abrosz Tisztakosz (Avrous Tiztakous). In greek it's gibberish, in hungarian it means <em>the tablecloth is very dirty</em>.
</li><li> How do you call the reired british gynecologist? -Sir Ben White. It's a normal british name, but in hungarian it sounds like <em>szőrben vájt</em>, literally meaning <em>was digging around in fur</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In Bulgarian and some other Slavic languages, "неделя" ("nedElya") or some similar word means "Sunday", and is an amalgamation of two words: "не" ("ne"), which simply negates whatever follows, and old Slavic word that sounds like "delo", meaning "work" (so Sunday is "no-work-day"). Makes sense, it's the day when nobody works, right? Both small words actually exist in Russian with the same meaning; but "неделя" also exists in Russian and means "week". Bulgarian used to have "nedelya" meaning "week" too, in the sense of "the time from one Suday to another", before it got replaced with "sedmitza" ("seven-parter").
</li><li> In Mexico, the name of the famous airplane manufacturer Boeing sounds the same as a famous brand of juice sold there named <em>Boing</em>. This becomes, after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor">source of jokes between Mexicans</a>:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Kid 1</strong>: What do the Twin Towers have in common with two sandwiches?
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Kid 2</strong>: Dunno
</div><div class="indent"> <strong>Kid 1</strong>: That's easy: You can screw them with a <strong>Bo(e)ing</strong>!
</div></li><li> In a similar way, the Israeli airliner El Al sounds like saying <em>The To the</em> in Spanish.
</li><li> Also, Airbus sounds similar in Russian to the word for "watermelon".
</li><li> A very common error in English-Spanish translations is assuming that billion in English and <em>billón</em> in Spanish mean the same. They do not. Billion is a thousand millions (10^9), while <em>billón</em> is a <em>million</em> millions (10^12, or <em>trillion</em> in English).
<ul><li> The same holds true in German, as the progression "million, billion, trillion, quadrillion" is "Million, Milliarde, Billion, Billiarde". Billiarde, again, has nothing to do with billards. Same system is actually used in most European countries (in Croatia: milijun, milijarda, trilijun, trilijarda).
</li><li> This is actually due to an error in American Newspapers around the year 1910. Numbers on the order of 10^9 were uncommon in daily use, but governmental budgets were approaching this number. Mathematically illiterate newspaper authors incorrectly called 10^9 one billion, instead of the English term one milliard. It took about 40 years for Britain to switch to what is now called the short billion system, where 10^9 is a billion and 10^12 is a trillion, but before Americans messed up, English speakers in both countries used what is now called the long billion system, where 10^9 is a milliard, 10^12 is a billion, 10^15 is a billiard, and so on.
</li></ul></li><li> The same goes with the definition of the word "mediocre" in either English and Spanish: While in English that word stands for something that is just OK, but neither good or excellent, in Spanish that word stands exclusively for something either <em>beyond terrible</em> or just awful.
</li><li> In the English and Greek speaking world, the name Kiki is an ordinarily fine name stemming from the Greek saint Kyriaki. Should this person travel to the Philippines, however, they may find introducing themselves to people a hassle, as their name means "pussy" in Tagalog. In Spain, meanwhile, a "kiki" is a "quickie".
<ul><li> Meanwhile in French, "kiki" is a childish word for "penis." And oddly enough, a common name for small dogs.
</li><li> The Thai name Pukitta is sometimes shortened to "Puki", another Filipino synonym for "kiki". Actually, "Puki" means "vagina" for most of South-East Asia (Thailand appears to be an exception), this is why the name of Garfield's teddy bear is rarely mentioned in the region, and when it does come up conversations become very awkward. Also why you get dirty stares if you call your significant other by that term.
</li></ul></li><li> The name of the ruler of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mobutu Sese Seko, sounds extremely funny for Spanish speakers, since his last name (Sese Seko) sounds like <em>Seso Seco</em> (Dried Brain).
</li><li> If you say "pet" to a speaker of Catalan or Valencian he is going to understand "flatulence" not "companion animal", but conversely if you say "fart" he is going to understand "having had enough of something" not "flatulence".
<ul><li> In Polish "pet" is a common colloquial term for "cigarette butt". On the other hand, "fart" means "fluke" or "good luck". Amusingly, some companies name themselves with that word.
</li><li> The "pet" thing also happens in French and partially in Italian (where "flatulence" is actually "peto", but still close enough to sound funny). Conversely, the Italian words "farti" and "fartelo" have nothing to do with flatulence: they both roughly mean "make you (something)".
</li></ul></li><li> There are three countries in Europe, whose - and also whose capitals' - Finnish names make complete sense in Finnish. They are <em>Puola</em> (Poland) - "spool" with capital <em>Varsova</em> (Warsaw) "foaling", <em>Malta</em> - "wait a minute!" with capital <em>Valetta</em> ("It's a lie!") and <em>Turkki</em> - "fur coat" (Turkey) with capital <em>Ankara</em> ("harsh").
</li><li> The German word for "turkey" (the bird) is "Pute". While not pronounced the same way, it is written exactly as the French word for "whore".
</li><li> <em>Tupelo</em> is the name of a city in the state of Mississippi, but for a Spanish speaker it sounds like the spanish words for "your hair". If there's people living in your hair maybe you have been delaying going to the barbershop for a little too long...
<ul><li> In Russian Tupelo means "it was becoming dumb".
</li></ul></li><li> In English, the word "moot" can mean a number of things; a point up for debate, a suggestion, and so on. Albanian speakers would hear this as <em>mut</em> - their equivalent of "shit".
<ul><li> Similarly, a speaker of Albanian hearing an automobile owner referring to their mode of transportation as a car might snicker, as the word is a homophone for <em>kar</em> - or "dick".
<ul><li> And if you <em>really</em> wanted to stretch it, a karat - the unit to describe gold purity, is the definite plural of the same thing, albeit with a different pronunciation (Albanians stress the a as in "f<strong>a</strong>ther").
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Tiberias, Israel, there's a inn named <a class="urllink" href="http://www.maman-mansion.co.il/index-e.asp">Maman Mansion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <em>Maman</em> is the Japanese slang equivalent of the phrase <strong>MILF</strong>.
<ul><li> In Spanish, especially in the Mexican dialect, <em>Maman</em> is a slang for <em>they can suck a...</em> (noun)
</li></ul></li><li> "Deception" means, or sounds similar to the word meaning, <em>disappointment</em> in several Romance languages.
<ul><li> It's also the case with the word "Ingenuity", that is similar to the word meaning "naivete".
</li></ul></li><li> Spanish-speakers travelling to English-speaking countries are often advised not to say that they're "constipated" if they catch a cold, as the English word has quite a different meaning from Spanish "constipado".
</li><li> In Icelandic, the word for slush is "krap" and the word for professionals is "<strong>fag</strong>menn".
</li><li> Learning about the Mongol invasions of Vietnam will invariably cause giggling fits amongst Vietnamese students. "Mongol-Yuan" is written as "Nguyên Mông" in Vietnamese, and the two words are homophones with "intact, whole" and "bottom". And given the fact that Vietnamese forces roundly kicked Mongolian butts (three times, totaling 9 months in the space of 30 years), let's just say that, uh, the Mongols did not leave Vietnam with their bottoms intact.
</li><li> While <em>Chicago</em> doesn't really mean anything in English, in Italian it sounds like "ci cago", which means "I shit there".
<ul><li> In the same vein, the Japanese city of <em>Kagoshima</em> sounds pretty hilarious in Italian (something like "I shit-shima"); then there's <em>Yokosuka</em>, which looks like "Yoko sucks it / Yoko blows" (only in written form: the "u" in its name is actually silent in Japanese).
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, both Detroit and the Alcatraz prison sounds funny in Spanish, since Detroit sounds phonetically similar to "detras" (behind/rear, but it's also an euphemism for "butt") and Alcatraz sounds like "atras" (which means the same thing as "detras"), making both places as the butt (no pun intended) of all kind of ass-related jokes:

</div></li><li> Many Japanese questions end with "desu ka" which sounds like Polish "deska" (wooden board but also a term used to describe someone who is flat-chested).
</li><li> German "geh!" (go!) sounds for Polish people like "gej" (gay).
</li><li> Czech car company name, koda (in Czech  denotes sound like English sh or Polish sz), sounds like Polish "szkoda" (<em>damage</em>, or <em>it's a pity</em>, or in "szkoda na to").
<ul><li> In fact, the Czech meaning is pretty much the same. The name comes from the last name of the founder of this company.
</li></ul></li><li> Russian letter Щ name <em>shcha</em> sounds like Polish "szcza" (vulgar <em>urinates</em>).
</li><li> The name of the car Proton Jebat has been a source of many laughs in the Czech Republic since it's been revealed. <em>Jebat</em> in Czech means <em>to fuck</em>.
</li><li> Still on the topic of Malaysian cars, another local car company called Perodua released a new line of cars known as the Axia- which is supposed to be "Asia" spelled in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">Xtreme Kool Letterz</a>. Unfortunately, the way it's pronounced sounds very close to the Hokkien Chinese dialect word for "airheaded". And Hokkien happens to be the third most spoken Chinese dialect in the country...
</li><li> There is a lightbulb company named "Osram" (a portmanteau of "Osmium" and "Wolfram" (tungsten)). In Polish language, this literally means "I'll shit (on something)".
<ul><li> There is a similar joke in Slovak as well.
</li></ul></li><li> The videogame company Sega sounds inherently funny to Italians. Why? "Sega" means "wank" in Italian. To be fair, it also means "handsaw", but that's clearly not the first meaning that comes to mind...
<ul><li> That's why the name was pronounced SEE-gah in Italian ads.
</li><li> In Portuguese it sounds like "cega" ("blind female").
</li></ul></li><li> The German word "Mist" (literally "manure", spelled and pronounced the same way as the English) is roughly equivalent to "crap" (<em>not</em> "shit," there's another word for that). Cue jokes about Sierra Mist here.
<ul><li> Cray used to have several of its supercomputers set up for external vendors to use when porting/testing software; they were mostly named after meteorological phenomena (for example, there was a Y-MP named "Hot"). They had one named "Mist" until the German office heard about it.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope occasionally also extends to mere abbreviations: In the UK and much of the rest of the world, 'RAF' is ubiquitous with Royal Air Force, who valiantly fought and gloriously beat back the Nazis in WW2. In Germany, however... it's instead ubiquitous with the Red Army Faction, a 1970s pseudo-Communist terrorist group responsible for dozens of bombings and assassinations and decades-long nation-wide man-hunts and paranoia. So naturally, their connotations of 'RAF' are <em>eons</em> worse than in the UK. To avoid confusion, the British RAF and the German RAF are almost always referred to unabbreviated in Germany and the rest of the world respectively.
<ul><li> 'RAF' is also occasionnally used in colloquial French for "Rien à faire" or, less politely, "Rien à foutre" (resp. "Not caring" and "Not giving a damn").
</li><li> RAF is also British slang for an ugly woman - <em>Rough As Fuck</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's the confusion between "IRA" in the British and American sense of the acronym. To Americans, "IRA" is a pension plan involving salary deductions - <strong>Individual Retirement Account</strong>. to the British it's an especially nasty Irish terrorist group with a tendency to plant bombs in crowded places and explode them without warning. When a major American fast food group tried to cut costs in its British operation by using payroll stationery imported from its American operation, employee deductions for pensions were listed on payslips under the heading - <strong>IRA</strong>. Given the undeniable fact the Irish Republican Army was notoriously funded by dollar donations from Irish-American sympathists in places like Boston<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note40b15a');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note40b15a" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note40b15a');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This caused a lot of resentment in Britain and strained relations with the USA; snarky people noted how selective the "War on Terrorism" was</span>, the story went around that this fast-food chain was making compulsory deductions from British employees to fund Irish terrorism. So for the sake of saving a few thousand dollars on payroll stationery, they got a shitload of bad PR...
<ul><li> There's a Brazilian rock band called Ira - as that word means "wrath" in Latin and several Romance languages.
</li></ul></li><li> The last name of the Nigerian soccer players (and also brothers) Celestine and Emmanuel <em>Babayaro</em> could sound extremely hilarious for Japanese speakers: It sounds similar to <em>bakayarou</em>, which means <em>Dumbass</em>. It also sounds like <em>Babaayarou</em>, translated as <em>Old hag bitch</em>.
</li><li> Also involving another player of African origin, there's French player Tiémoué Bakayoko, whose surname means "stupid Yoko" in Japanese.
</li><li> In a related note, there's a Scottish soccer player of African origin named Karamoko Dembele, whose name sounds like "snot face" in Spanish.
</li><li> Due to Hebrew orthographic limitations, the first name Finn is written in Hebrew the same way as the Hebrew word for penis, <em>pin</em> (פין). This makes watching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Finn Hudson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Finn the Human</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife">Finn Polmar</a>, and others on their respective shows in Israel (where dubbing is used exclusively for children-oriented material and subbing is used otherwise) very awkward.
</li><li> <em>Rav</em> or <em>raban</em> is Hebrew for rabbi (which originally meant my <em>rav</em>). Hebrew omits the copula in the present tense under certain circumstances. And now, every time you hear the name <a class="urllink" href="http://www.pacorabanne.com/">Paco Rabanne<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, youll get the image of a Mexican rabbi.
</li><li> "Kimi" is a Finnish male first name. It's also one of many words in Japanese for "you". As well, "hei" is either "hello" in Finnish, or the English word "hey" written in Japanese phonetics. So "Hei, Kimi" can mean either "Hello, Kimi" or "Hey, you".
</li><li> When James May of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> warned his fellow presenters that "car" and "peach" were rude words in Albanian, they blew him off. It turns out he was right: "kar" (pronounced like "car") means "penis", while "piçkë" (pronounced roughly like "peach") means "vagina".
</li><li> There's a river in western part of Latvia called Pērse - which means "ass" in Estonian.
</li><li> Irishwomen named Órfhlaith (pronounced ORE-lah, lit. gold princess) are in for an unpleasant surprise if they ever visit Israel;<em>orlá</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1op15');"><sup>Hebrew </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1op15" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1op15');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">ערלה</span> means foreskin in Hebrew.
</li><li> "College" in French is used for a school accepting children between 11 and 15.
<ul><li> And in German a "Gymnasium" is a type of school for students between the ages of roughly 10-18. The closest US equivalent would probably be "magnet school"; there <em>is</em> a type of Gymnasium with a focus on sport, but it's more common for them to concentrate on humanities (including Latin, Greek, and occasionally Ancient Hebrew) or on STEM classes.
</li></ul></li><li> "Tröja" is a Swedish word meaning "sweater". Italian "troia" means "whore".
</li><li> Similarly, "curva" (the Italian, Spanish and Portuguese word for "curve") sounds like "kurva", the word for "whore" in many Slavic languages.
</li><li> The British actor Tony Osoba's surname means "person" in Czech.
</li><li> "Hai" means "yes," "lungs," and several other things in Japanese, but means "shark" in German and Norwegian. Conversely, "Schurke" means "rogue", while the English "shark" is derived from the Mayan "xoc" (pronounced like shock).
</li><li> The Italian word for "down", "giù," sounds exactly like "Jew".
</li><li> The German verb "bekommen" does not mean "to become" (that's "werden"), but "to receive".
</li><li> In the case of 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPronunciationGuide">No Pronunciation Guide</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateNames">Unfortunate Names</a> conspire to result in this, due to the correct pronunciation of his last name resembling...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">something decidedly non-philosophical</a>.
</li><li> In English-speaking countries, Knepper is a more or less innocuous-sounding surname, but in Danish, "knepper" is an inflected form of the verb "kneppe" which means "to fuck". The "k" is not silent in Danish, though. Inevitably, a lot of Danes can't read or talk about Robert Knepper while keeping a straight face.
</li><li> The German and Dutch word for "yes" is "ja", causing some confusion in Japan, where "iya" means "no" or "I don't want". "Ja" or "ya" is also the Russian first-person personal pronoun (I).
</li><li> A English-borrowed case: in Japanese a confession (of any sort) is sometimes called a "kaminguauto" (coming-out).
</li><li> The English word "vixen" sounds like "wichsen", the German word for "to masturbate". Although this is somewhat reciprocated in the English word "fox," this word in German being "(der) Fuchs" and is pronounced similarly to the English "fucks."
<ul><li> Fuchs is a German family name... and yes, "Fucks" and "Fuck" are possible spellings of it.
</li></ul></li><li> "Wahine", the Polynesian word for "woman", sounds like the Latin pronunciation of "vagina".
</li><li> "Fahrt" means "drive" or "trip" in German (ruckfahrt=round trip). The actual translation of "fart" is "furz".
</li><li> The English <em>raccoon</em> and the Greek <em>procyon</em> look similar and both refer to the same animal, but have completely different origins. The former is derived from the Algonquin <em>arakun</em>(scratcher), while the former is from Ancient Greek <em>pro kuon</em> (before the dog).
</li><li> <em>Emoji</em>, contrary to popular belief, is not a Japanization of <em>emoticon</em>, but instead literally means "pictograph".
</li><li> The French word "douche" ("shower", the object) is pronounced the same way as "douche" in English
</li><li> A few Japanese words are English loanwords, but the words mean something different in English than they do in Japanese. For example, the Japanese word for "apartment" is "manshon", which comes from the English word "mansion".
</li><li> Japanese for "cook" is "kokku", which sounds like "cock" (it's actually the Japanese pronunciation of the English word).
</li><li> The German word for a mobile phone is "ein Handy". In English, "handy" is an adjective meaning "useful". Native German speakers seem to find it particularly easy to slip up on this one, perhaps because the word is directly borrowed from English.
</li><li> Finnish has a lot of words that look or sound like English words, but mean different things, such as "tie" (road) and "vain" (only). "Vain" is also pronounced like the English word "vine". "Vaippa" sounds like "viper", but it means "diaper". "Puu" (pronounced exactly how you'd expect it to be) means "wood" or "tree". "Pussi" (sounds like "pussy") means "bag". "Happi" means "oxygen". "Fagotti" means "bassoon" (similar to Italian and other languages). "Pasuuna" (which sounds almost exactly like "bassoon") means "trombone". "Harmonikka" means "accordion". "Flipperi" is the Finnish word for a pinball machine. "Kola" (sounds like "cola") is a generic Finnish slang term for any carbonated soft drink, not specifically Coca-Cola. "Me" means "we" and "he" means "they" (though they're pronounced more like "meh" and "heh"). "Tyyppi" means "character", as in someone with a colourful personality (one Finnish business college had the quasi-English slogan "Enter the Type" at first because of this).
</li><li> The Italian word for goodbye, "ciao", sounds like the English word "chow", slang for "food" or "to eat".
</li><li> "Porn" is a common Thai name. Then there's the cities of Bangkok and Phuket.
</li><li> The Scandinavian name Astrid, "divine beauty", looks and sounds like but is unrelated to the Greek word for "star child".
</li><li> The <em>mare</em> of Germanic folklore is not a female horse, but a demon that brings bad dreams, hence the cognate <em>nightmare</em>. The Filipino analogue is the <em>batibat</em>, which is not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Count von Count's happy dance</a>.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zalzala_Koh">Zalzalah Koh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a newly discovered island in Pakistan, means "Earthquake Island", for it was formed during a strong earthquake in Pakistan in 2013. But in the Philippines, it sounds like "I'm a wanker". Just look at this <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1mic3UNGk">weather reporter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> failing to retain his serious composure.
</li><li> There's a German surname (and at least one company) "Niggermann".
<ul><li> It's arguably worse in France, where "Nègre" is a last name as well (such as with French record executive and talent show judge <a class="urllink" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_N&lt;!--C3--&gt;A8gre">Pascal Nègre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) but it is <em>exactly</em> the French equivalent of the N-word.
</li></ul></li><li> "Hell" means "Luck" in Norwegian.
</li><li> In Japanese, the common Irish expression <em>Sin é</em> ("That's it" or "That's how it is") sounds like <em>Shine</em>, i.e. ordering someone to die.
</li><li> Hyundai's brand new SUV is called the Kona. It's another unfortunate name for a car, because "kona" in Polish means that something is dying. So, "Hyundai Kona" to Polish people sounds literally like "Hyundai is dying".
</li><li> The word "ser" in Spanish means "to be". In Polish "ser" (written and pronounced exactly the same way) means "cheese".
</li><li> Some Turkish names tend to sound... odd to the French. The best example is the male name "Tamer", which means "skilled, respected person" or "the one who is completely manly". Calling out this name in the streets of a French-speaking city is... awkward to say the least. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Tamer is spelt the same as "ta mère" in French, which means</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMom">"your mom"</a>.
<ul><li> A lesser example would be the female name "Naz", which means "coyness" in Turkish and "good for nothing" in French (also spelt as "naze").
</li></ul></li><li> The pioneer of Thai cuisine in the Philippines was a restaurant named Sukothai. However, its low success in its early years was partly blamed because its name sounded like "Suka Tae" - which is Filipino for "Vomit Poo".
</li><li> In Japanese, "shi" is a syllable commonly found in words (and a word on its own, meaning — depending on the kanji used — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">"four" or "death"</a>). It happens to sound like the English word "she". And unfortunately for English speakers, it is often followed by a syllable beginning with "t"...
<ul><li> Japanese also has the syllables "mi", "hi" and "yu", which sound like "me", "he" and "you". Unlike in Chinese, these <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note41kglr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note41kglr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note41kglr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">with the exception of "Yu", more commonly written as "Yuu"</span> aren't names on their own, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosOnFirst">Who's on First?</a> is rarer than you might expect.
</li><li> In Korean, "ai" (아이) means "child". In Japanese, "ai" (愛) means "love". And both sound like the English word "I". And to further complicate matters, in Hokkien Chinese, it means "want" (要), <em>but</em> depending on the context it can also mean "love".
</li></ul></li><li> The Japanese onomatopoeia for "soft", "moco-moco", sounds very similar to the Swedish "mjuk", meaning the same thing.
</li><li> In German, "Geld" means money. In English, "geld" means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">something else</a>.
</li><li> One reason behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermansLoveDavidHasselhoff">Kit-Kats big success in Japan</a> is the fact that "Kit Kat" sounds a lot like the phrase "Kittso-Katsu", which translated literally means "You will surely win".
</li><li> A Japanese to Hawaiian example: those who watch enough <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em> would know that "ohana" means family. In Japanese, the o part of the word basically holds no distinction and the word "Hana" means "flower". This is aggrivated if one is listening to the opening theme of the 2007 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SylvanianFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SylvanianFamilies">Sylvanian Families</a></em> OVAs, in which said word appears, when not knowing Japanese well or at all; one would assume the verse of the song is talking about the families when it is basically talking about flowers.
</li><li> Another Japanese example this time to English: "Ippai" basically means "full". In English, it sounds like "Eat pie". So the opening theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChibiMarukoChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChibiMarukoChan">Chibi Maruko-chan</a></em>, "Yume Ippai" (lit. "full of dreams"), is often misheard as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HulkSpeak">you, me, eat pie</a>".
</li><li> Some Malay to English examples:
<ul><li> The Malay word for <em>money</em> is both "Wang" and "Duit" (pronounced "Do it"). Yes, there are teen jokes about prostitution centered around the words.
</li><li> When someone's telling you "sakit" (pronounced "suck it"), they are in pain and asking for help, and are not rudely telling you off.
</li><li> Then there is "tolong", which is sometimes misheard as "too long". Again, they are crying for help and not complaining about something taking too long to complete.
</li><li> On the tamer side, the Malay word for water is... <em>air</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In Korean, <em>sarang</em> means <em>love</em>. In Malay, it means <em>nest</em>. Romantic connotations about starting a family aside, it is confusing to people who don't speak Korean.
</li><li> The German word "scharf" means "sharp", but looks like English "scarf". In German, "scarf" is "Schal"... which looks and sounds like English "shall (do something)", but is an actual cognate of "shawl".
<ul><li> Also in German, "month" is "Monat", which to English speakers (especially art fans) looks like a misspelling of the French surname Monet.
</li><li> German "brav" looks like English "brave", but means "good" or "honest".
</li></ul></li><li> More than one Spanish-speaking Jew had to tolerate the fact that the name of the famous Jewish rite of the <em>Bar Mitzvah</em> sounds like the name of a <em>bar</em>, in the sense of a place where alcoholic beverages are served. It should be noted that this only applies to the Spanish language, where bar names always begin with "Bar (name of the place)", which causes much confusion for a Gentile who does not know the etymology of the word:
<div class="indent"><strong>Jewish person</strong>: I went to a <em>Bar Mitzvah</em> with my family yesterday.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note424ead');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note424ead" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note424ead');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Fui ayer al Bar Mitzvah con mi familia.</span>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Gentile</strong>: I see, I also went to the "bar" close to my house last week.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4357in');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4357in" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4357in');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ya veo, to tambien fui la semana pasada al bar que esta cerca de mi casa.</span>
</div></li><li> In a similar way, the above also happens with the name of the Israeli actress and model Bar Rafaeli (or anyone with the name "Bar") for the same reasons in Spanish.
</li><li> Men named Todd will face problems in German-speaking countries; "der Tod" is German for "death".
<ul><li> In Dutch, "death" is "dood". An English-speaker with no knowledge of Dutch will assume it's pronounced like "dude".
</li></ul></li><li> "parking" in English is a verb, and means the act of parking a car. "parking" in French is a noun, and means the place where you park a car (which in English is a "car park").
</li><li> There's a Mexican movie director named <a class="urllink" href="http://hari.tv/index.html">Hari Sama<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose name is pretty funny in Japanese, since it could be translated as "Lord Needle" (針様)
</li><li> Finnish language has the words "matka" (journey) and "kotka" (eagle). In Polish, the same words mean "mother" and "female cat", respectively.
<ul><li> In Bulgarian, "kotka" also means cat, but "matka" means uterus.
</li></ul></li><li> While "susu" in Malay and Indonesia means "milk," which sounds innocuous, in Hindi it takes on a more offensive meaning: "piss."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SeanConnery">Sean Connery</a>'s surname sounds like the French word <em>connerie</em>, which means "bullshit". This also leads to a joke that if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArethaFranklin">Aretha Franklin</a> married him, her married name would have been "Aretha Connery", which sounds like "<em>Arrete ta connerie</em>" ("Stop your bullshit").
</li><li> "Cuckoo" sounds like "cul-cul", which is French for buttocks.
</li><li> The name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Germany">Germany</a> in the Czech language is "Německo". In Japanese, while pronounced phonetically and without diacritics, the word sounds the same as the word "nemeko" (睨め子) which means "glaring child".
</li><li> "Kamala" means "horrible" in Finnish. As a result,some detractors of Kamala Harris who know Finnish have given her the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingNickname">Embarrassing Nickname</a> "Horrible Harris".
</li><li> Bulgarian has a few:
<ul><li> German "Ebene" ("plain" or "plane") and "eben" ("just so"), cognates to English "even", sound like "ебане" <em>[ebane]</em>, "[the act of] fucking". Ditto for English "ebb".
</li><li> "Кур" <em>[kur]</em> used, as in Old Slavic, to mean "rooster", but much like "cock" in English, has evolved as an euphemism for phallus (and then also became just as obscene). In Bulgarian, it has only retained that meaning, making Russian "курица" <em>[kuritsa]</em> ("hen") sound funny, as well as unrelated words like "курить" <em>[kurit']</em> ("to smoke") and names such as "Кура" <em>[Kura]</em> (in Bulgarian: "The Dick") and "Курск" <em>[Kursk]</em>; Other languages aren't safe either, such as German "Kur" ("cure") and "Kurort" ("resort", which has been introduced to Bulgarian and is hence a subject of puns when complaining about a resort's low quality) or Romanian "cur" ("ass").
<ul><li> Speaking of Romanian, there's "buza" which means "lip" in Romanian but "cheek" in Bulgarian. One could imagine some romantic drama ensuing along the lower Danube. Other such words exist, owing to the two countries' history of being closely associated with one another until the Late Middle Ages but then diverging.
</li></ul></li><li> Anything with "ser-" ("serum", "seropositive", "serotonine", "serine", "serrated") could sound funny, because of the verb "сера" <em>[sera]</em> ("to poop"). This includes any word derived from the Italian "sera" (evening), such as "serenade" or even the greeting "buona sera".
</li><li> Any mention of the phrase "all I know" will raise eyebrows because it sounds like "о, лайно" ("oh, [a piece of] shit").
</li><li> English names "Michael" and "Mike" sound like "майка" <em>[maika]</em> ("mother").
</li><li> Even Latin isn't safe. One notorious example is the mountain pine, <em>Pinus mugo</em>. When written together with the name of its doscoverer, Antonio Turra, it reads like <em>Pinus mugo Turra</em>, which sounds like "'mu go tura", or "[I'm] gonna put it into [him/it]".
</li><li> There's a joke about an Italian football team visiting and then departing with chants "Saluti e baci" ("greetings and kisses"). To a Bulgarian, however, that sounds like "[they] are some sassy fuck-machines". Female fans commented "yeah, they only lived up to the sassy part".
</li><li> "Путка" <em>[putka]</em> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMatters">Country Matters</a>, so Russophobes make fun of Vladimir Putin's name. One Bulgarian footballer happened to be interviewed by a South African journalist named Putco Mafani, which in Bulgarian sounds like a demented form of "you cunt, grab me".
</li><li> In the early 2000s, the Indian company Mittal Steel, property of the Mittal family, purchased Bulgaria's foremost metalworking facility. Their name coincidentally sounds like the Bulgarian word for "metal" as spoken with an Eastern Bulgarian accent.
</li><li> "Add" and "Ad" both sound like "Ад" (hell).
</li><li> Germans, especially former East Germans, saying "cheers" ("Prost") should be aware that this means "uncultured/stupid [man]" in Bulgarian.
</li><li> Ditto for "Hui", as described below for Russian.
</li></ul></li><li> Much like English-speakers might giggle when they see the Chinese name "Wang," Russian-speakers have trouble with the also-incredibly-common Chinese syllable "Hui." Again similar to English, this is the Russian word for "dick." However unlike in English, "hui" is considered an <em>incredibly</em> rude expletive in Russian. This has led to both much awkwardness and much hilarity for Russian speakers. Russians have adopted the practice of phonetically transcribing the Chinese syllable as "huei" just to avoid writing <em>that</em> word.
</li><li> The German for "Christian" (the noun) is "Christ", and the German for "Christ" is "der Christus". Since in German you don't say "I am <strong>a</strong> Berliner/teacher/Christian" but just "I am Berliner/teacher/Christian", this means the German for "I am a Christian" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousBoast">"Ich bin Christ"</a>.
</li><li> In English "commode" usually means a commode chair or a toilet. In German "Kommode" means a chest of drawers. Adding to the confusion, "commode" in English <em>can</em> mean a chest of drawers too, but almost everyone will think of the first and more common definition.
</li><li> "halal" means "lawful" in Arabic and is used for many things. In Hungarian "halál" means "death". An eerie coincidence, because when non-Muslims hear the Arabic word, the meaning they automatically think of is "halal slaughter" — an infamously brutal method of slaughtering animals without stunning them.
</li><li> In German "Bildung" has nothing to do with buildings; it means "education". "Gebäude" means "building" (noun) and "bauen" means "building" (verb).
</li><li> The German word "weiss/weiß" means both "white" (as in "Edelweiss") and "know" (as in the fairly common phrase "ich weiss", or "I know"). It sounds like the English word "vice" (which can mean anything from shockingly immoral behaviour to a minor character flaw).
</li><li> In Mandarin Chinese, the Hmong ethnic group are known as the Miao, which sounds like the English onomatopoeia for a cat vocalization.
</li><li> The Spanish idiom "No hay de que" (You're welcome) sounds like the shorthand for "No, I Don't Know".
</li><li> "Sonrisa", despite the resemblance to "sunrise", is Spanish for "smile".
</li><li> The German word for "hat" provides two-for-the-price-of-one potential confusion for English speakers: it's spelled "Hut", like the English word for a small house, and pronounced "hoot", like the noise owls make.
