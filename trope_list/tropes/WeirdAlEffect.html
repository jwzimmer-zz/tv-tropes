For example, many people are now more familiar with "I Lost on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em>" than with the original "Jeopardy" by the Greg Kihn Band.

<ul><li> For those wondering how people could make such a mistake with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a>, he <em>does</em> also have a lot of original humorous songs. Most of us older folks know him better for his parodies, but he's spanned a few generations since his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento">Dr. Demento</a> days and is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.weirdal.com/">still going strong<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Moreover, knowing <strong>that</strong> a song is a parody and knowing the song it parodies are two different things.
<ul><li> Coolio was quite peeved about "Amish Paradise", for which Yankovic had obtained permission through official channels but not through Coolio himself. He felt that Weird Al's version trivialized the seriousness of the song. Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> on the other side of the spectrum stated that having your song parodied by Weird Al is like a rite of passage to being an artist in the music industry. This was backed up in an earlier interview by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Kurt Cobain</a> where he said when Al called him about making a parody of "Smells like Teen Spirit" is when he realized Nirvana made it in the music industry.
</li><li> To confuse matters further, many of Al's original songs are "style parodies" where he parodies a band's/artist's musical style instead of a specific song. Because he does change the music a bit even with parodies, this leads to some thinking that these style parodies are a parody of a specific song. Examples follow:

</li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once-An-Album</a> polka medleys tend to be time capsules of a particular period in music, covering both enduring hits and flashes in the pan. For instance, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/oYWvi4Y5soU">"Polka Your Eyes Out"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from 1992 <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02se1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note02se1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02se1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(which many consider his best medley)</span> is bookended by "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol">Cradle of Love</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce">Ice Ice Baby</a>", but in-between has such classics as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">Losing My Religion</a>," "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheB52s">Love Shack</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Enter Sandman</a>".
<ul><li> Referenced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheFlashTub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/TheFlashTub">The Flash Tub</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/flash-tub/gamescott-reviews-cartoon.php">Gamescott Review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which is a parody of both 90's internet videos and internet game reviews) in the end credits, crediting Papa Roach's "Last Resort" to "Weird Al", since Weird Al did cover it in one of his medleys.
</li><li> Incidentally, the polka medleys themselves are an example of this trope. A lot of us probably don't remember Stars on 45, a Dutch novelty act which created song medleys set to disco. Al took the concept, only he set the medley to polka music instead with "Polkas On 45". While Stars on 45 is largely forgotten, Al continues to feature polka medleys on each of his albums (except "Even Worse" and arguably "Alapalooza", where instead of a medley he did a polka cover of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody").
</li></ul></li><li> Because Weird Al was effectively the only parody artist to hit it big in the pop music era, there is a widespread, pronounced tendency on the Internet to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisattributedSong">attribute to Weird Al</a> <em>any</em> parody song whose artist is otherwise unknown. This has been especially common on pirate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MP3">MP3</a> repositories such as Napster, where searching on Weird Al would produce any number of non-Al music, some of it obscene or offensive, with his name on it. (Weird Al is on record as saying that this mistaken identity, rather than any theoretical lost revenue, is the biggest unwanted effect piracy has on him personally.)

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/EnergizerBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Advertising/EnergizerBunny">Energizer Bunny</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mascot">mascot</a> for the Energizer brand of batteries for over 20 years, was originally a parody of an ad campaign by rival Duracell, in which a small and cute bunny with a small drum powered by their battery would last longer than one powered by their chief rival — which in the commercial was Everlast to not name Energizer (owned by Eveready at the time) by name. (Energizer's ad was that its bunny, like its battery, was too large and impressive for Duracell's ad.) In part due to its effectiveness as a campaign and in part due to Duracell not keeping up with the trademarks, the original bunny is all but forgotten in North America (although still active in other continents). Duracell claimed that 40% of the audience thought they were still Duracell ads, but never really tried to back that up.
</li><li> The phrase, "It's not nice to fool Mother Nature" has been used and re-used so often (just as often as a parody as not), that it's approached the point where many people have no idea where it actually came from (for the record, it was from a 1970 commercial for a butter substitute called Chiffon).
<ul><li> Similarly, the phrase "that's-a spicy meatball-a" is used in a few places. It was originally from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommercialSwitcheroo">a fake ad</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/xUpj9oTNIBI">for meatballs inside an Alka-Seltzer ad from 1969<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> And again for a very distinct, hushed delivery of "We've secretly replaced somebody's 'X' with 'Y.' Let's see if they can tell the difference." Originally from a Seventies and Eighties ad campaign for <a class="urllink" href="http://mst3kriffaday.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/31-weve-replaced-the-pacific-ocean-with-folgers-crystals-lets-watch/">Folger's Coffee Crystals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but the references to it have far outlasted the ads.
</li><li> This is, in fact, pretty common with commercials. The endless repetition of them can easily create annoyance, which means writers and creators will see them as ripe for parody in their work, with the end result being the parodies can live on even when the ad campaign itself ends.

<ul><li> The pirates in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> comics are close parodies (allowing for the difference in art style) of Captain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BarbeRouge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BarbeRouge">Barbe-Rouge</a> (Redbeard) and his crew in the comic of the same name. Originally published in the same magazine as <em>Asterix</em>, <em>Barbe-Rouge</em> is almost unknown outside France. You have a shot at recognizing them if you've seen one of the 90s cartoon shows, but the parody characters have such a distinct look that it's not obvious.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iznogoud">Iznogoud</a></em> contained a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to specifically to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> versions of the pirates in one story. They look much more like their <em>Asterix</em> designs and the crow's nest pirate observes that the ship they're about to attack 'has no Gauls on it'.
</li><li> Furthermore the pirates, on yet another occasion when their ship is smashed by Asterix and Co, end up in a sequence with them parodying the now somewhat obscure painting "The Raft of the Medusa". Said painting is actually pretty famous in France, and a mainstay of school textbooks on French painting. The parody has untranslatable French puns involving the idiomatic meaning of "médusé" (stupefied). The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woolseyism">English translation</a> has them say "We've been framed, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPun">Jericho</a>!" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4mpvy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4mpvy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4mpvy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The painting is by Théodore Géricault, whose last name is pronounced close to "Jericho" in French.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> generally is packed solid with references to French politics, society, and other such in-jokes, though in some cases the original reference are quite obscure nowadays. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AsterixAndTheBanquet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AsterixAndTheBanquet">Asterix and the Banquet</a></em> Asterix meets a group of characters in Marseille, who are a shout-out to the 1930s movies <em>Fanny</em> and <em>Marius</em> by Marcel Pagnol, something most people of today, even in France, wouldn't get. The antagonist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ObelixAndCo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/ObelixAndCo">Obelix and Co.</a>.</em> is supposed to be a parody of Jacques Chirac. Yes, as in <em>former President of France</em> Jacques Chirac, though the parody was focused on his largely-forgotten-outside-France stint as Prime Minister.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a>: How many people today think of the Dalton brothers as the historical Bob, Grat, Bill and Emmett, compared to the Dalton Brothers as <em>Lucky Luke's</em> Joe, Jack, William and Averell? In Europe and the French-speaking world, at least, it's not even a contest.
<ul><li> Joe, Jack, William and Averell are supposed to be the Dalton <em>cousins</em>. The "historical" Dalton <em>brothers</em> were featured (caricatured) in the album <em>Outlaw</em> which is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyRealDaddy">forgotten because Goscinny didn't write it</a>, plus it's just one album vs. over 20, plus they were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> whereas Lucky Luke moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> a few albums later.
</li><li> There are others who may associate the Daltons as Dinky, Pinky, Stinky, etc. from <em>Huckleberry Hound</em>.
</li><li> Morris' work on the series in general has resulted in this. He liked to parody various overused tropes from Western films, and the distinctive features and screen personas of actors associated with the genre. While the comics keep getting reprinted, much of the European audience is no longer particularly familiar with the parodied films, or with tropes that haven't seen much use since the 1960s. Most of the actors parodied are also long gone, and in some cases poorly remembered.
</li></ul></li><li> Solomon Grundy, born on a Monday. Also, he is a zombie. If you know of Solomon Grundy, chances are you probably know him from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">the comics</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">cartoon</a>, but not from the nursery rhyme. In Mexico, there is a wrestler known as Solomon Grundy, and people don't know about any rhyme, comic, or cartoon. The rhyme itself IS mentioned in the popular Batman series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheLongHalloween">The Long Halloween</a></em>. It is also briefly referenced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> and Arkham City. One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> cartoon episode has him sacrifice himself for something (nevermind that being a zombie, he can't really die off permanently). The gravestone shown usually mentions the rhyme. The rhyme is also referenced in the Batman story "One Night in Slaughter Swamp", published in Batman: Shadow of the Bat # 39 (1995). The Crash Test Dummies also used his name for their Superman song, only because it rhymed with money. ...sorta. The rhyme was also used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Ollie</a> quipping "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostMortemOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostMortemOneLiner">Died on Saturday; buried on Sunday</a>" after defeating him.
<ul><li> Note that the 19th-century nursery rhyme has a couple of variations, but is only eight lines long and gives the Grundy depicted no individual traits. Making it unlikely to receive many memorable adaptations. In its longer form, the nursery rhyme simply describes the rather conventional course of life for a man. Grundy was (in order) born, Christened, married, taken ill, having his medical condition further deteriorating, died due to his illness, and then buried.
</li></ul></li><li> Many comic book fans didn't even realize that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> had other characters besides Wesley Dodds and Morpheus who went by "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a>" until they saw Hector Hall acting foolish in volume 2 of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s celebrated series.
</li><li> While the characters of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> have become popular and well-known despite only being in that story, the original Charlton heroes that inspired their creation have almost faded into obscurity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle">Blue Beetle</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom">Captain Atom</a> have managed to escape this to some extent, but Thunderbolt and the Peacemaker (Ozymandias and the Comedian's counterparts respectively) have suffered.
<ul><li> In Thunderbolt's case, he isn't owned by DC anymore. Pete Morisi, the creator of the character, eventually claimed full ownership over him. Morisi died in 2003, and his estate still owns the rights to the character. Thunderbolt still had a second lasting contribution to comics aside from Ozymandias, though: his quartered black and red costume influenced Bruce Timms design for Harley Quinn. (On a curiosity, Pete Morisi based the Thunderbolt's costume on the "symmetrically divided, red-and-blue costume" of a 1940s superhero: "Daredevil" by Lev Gleason Publications. Morisi had attempted to purchase the rights to the defunct character, but after one of the co-owners refused, he simply decided to create an expy with a similar costume.)
</li><li> And Peacemaker only very superficially resembled the Comedian, making any connection ridiculous on its face. (If they ever met, they would <em>not</em> get along.)
</li><li> For that matter, a <em>very</em> early form of <em>Watchmen</em> would have had it using the even <em>more</em> obscure MLJ heroes, whom Moore thought DC owned at the time. The Comedian's 1940s origin and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainPatriotic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainPatriotic">Captain Patriotic</a> elements come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheShield">The Shield</a>—the original pitch was more or less "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTriggeringDeath">The Shield gets murdered; how do the other heroes handle it</a>?"

</li><li> Another <em>Watchmen</em> one: Moore and Gibbons' use of the 9-panel grid has prompted a lot of people, including comic book historians, to believe that Steve Ditko (the creator of the original Charlton characters) worked almost exclusively in the 9-panel grid format. This is not to say that Ditko didn't use it frequently, but it was hardly his "go to" layout.

In America anyway... Bonfire Night is still a well-celebrated national holiday in the UK, and kids are taught about the history behind it in school. Its meaning is shifting even beyond that, now that it's being used as a tool of 4chan/anonymous for their real-world protests (although, technically they are using it in the style in which it is portrayed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a>) — and this applies to both the US and UK as the mask has lately appeared on the office wall of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd">The IT Crowd</a></em>.

</li><li> British technology news/discussion site The Register also uses the mask as the only icon available for Anonymous Coward posts.
</li><li> For that matter, the English word "guy" is itself a reference to Guy Fawkes that has evolved over the centuries to be used as reference for anyone, not just an effigy of the original Guy.

In particular, the comic took major cues from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> issues penned by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a>, who was famous for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorThumbprint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorThumbprint">fascination with Japanese culture</a>. The most obvious aspects were the Turtles' mentor "Splinter" (as opposed to Daredevil's mentor "Stick"), and their enemies "The Foot Clan" (Daredevil's were "The Hand"). The Turtles' origin story, involving a runaway canister of radioactive chemicals, also parodied Daredevil's origin.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note50fkz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note50fkz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note50fkz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Matt Murdock was hit in the eyes with a canister of radioactive chemicals as a teenager, while the Turtles were mutated after a canister of radioactive chemicals leaked into the sewers after hitting a teenage boy "near his eyes"; some versions even strongly imply that the teenage boy actually <em>was</em> Matt Murdock in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawyerFriendlyCameo">Lawyer-Friendly Cameo</a>.</span> And their basic character dynamic parodied the X-Men—another surrogate family of temperamental teenage mutants with contrasting personalities. Even their most iconic villains, the samurai Oroku Saki ("The Shredder") and the grotesque alien Krang, took some obvious inspiration from the Marvel villains <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Samurai">Keniuchio Harada<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ("The Silver Samurai") and the grotesque mutant <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MODOK">MODOK<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

To understand how far <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> goes, there are references to <em>Victorian porn novels that have been out of print for decades</em>, and visual reference gags can number in the triple figures <em>on one page</em>. It gets even worse once he gets into the twentieth century.
<ul><li> In some cases the characters mentioned or encountered are from the 19th century, but not from British literature. There are cameos for example of Auguste Dupin (created by Edgar Allan Poe) and Anna/Nana Coupeau (created by Émile Zola). Also there are references to even older characters. Issue second includes a reference to the character Lady Termagant Flaybum. Flaybum is a major character in an 18th-century novel concerning flagellations, and having a sado-masochistic tone.
</li><li> There are also unusual depictions of famous characters, such as Charles Dickens' characters outside their typical era. One scene involves an aging thief giving Fagin-like training to a group of child thieves. Moore does not give a name for the old man, but the implication is that we are seeing child-thief Artful Dodger in his old age. He became a copy of his mentor. Another scene involves a young rape victim who seems unusually optimistic. The name given for her is Polly Whittier, a character better known as "Pollyanna".

<ul><li> There is a Suske en Wiske story called <em>De Texasrakkers</em> ("The Texas Scoundrels"), which was originally a shout-out to the popular 1950s TV western series <em>The Texas Rangers</em>, but this show is nowadays completely forgotten.

Nowadays most people in Flanders and the Netherlands will automatically think of him, rather than these popes. Similarly there are lot of children who know Urbanus more as a comic book character than as the comedian he was based on, mostly because Urbanus doesn't perform that often anymore.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent327" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Agent327">Agent 327</a></em>: This series started out as a parody of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JamesBond">James Bond</a>, but mostly the campy 1960s version.

Practically everything about the story arc's plot was inspired by the <em>Avengers</em> episode in some way: Jean Grey's famously kinky "Black Queen" outfit was an exact replica of Emma Peel's "Queen of Sin" costume, and Jason Wyngarde was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookFantasyCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookFantasyCasting">modeled after</a> British actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterWyngarde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterWyngarde">Peter Wyngarde</a>, who guest-starred as that episode's villain. But while the Hellfire Club in <em>The Avengers</em> appeared only once, Marvel's Hellfire Club has remained a major part of the X-Men mythos for over three decades, and most younger fans don't know about its origins, especially in the US, where the syndication package <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">omitted that episode</a> and it only became available much later. It helps that their introductory appearance was in the first part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga">The Dark Phoenix Saga</a></em>, the most beloved <em>X-Men</em> story of all time.
<ul><li> Fewer people still may be aware that the Hellfire Club was a real thing, albeit not necessarily evil, but rather a series of 18th century gentlemen's clubs that took a satirical and ironic view of society and religion. Calling themselves "devils" and engaging in mock ceremonies that mostly just involved alcohol and pranks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">Flanderization</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseHistory">Artistic License  History</a> likely inspired their appearance in <em>The Avengers</em>.
</li><li> The other part of Jason Wyngarde's name is from the amiably cheesy TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JasonKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JasonKing">Jason King</a></em> (197172), in which Wyngarde portrayed a foppish writer who is often mistaken for the hero of his adventure novels.

Considering that <em>Stardust</em> is deep inside "cult fanbase" territory, and the few fans it does have generally don't overlap with people who buy <em>SpongeBob</em> tie-in comics, it's anyone's guess how many kids were left very confused by that issue.

If you search the song on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, more <em>Undertale</em> versions appear than <em>Steven Universe</em> videos and various <em>Undertale</em> versions have more views than the Garnet version.

<ul><li> Of course, Genie's impressions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Aladdin">Aladdin</a></em> were always meant as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalBonus">Parental Bonus</a>, but some are getting obscure even for the adults, at least the ones who weren't already adults in the 1990s. You know when Genie says there are provisos and quid pro quos? That's an impression of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFBuckleyJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamFBuckleyJr">William F. Buckley Jr.</a>, whom you're unlikely to be familiar with if you're either not American or not old enough to remember the Reagan administration.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo">Dumbo</a></em>'s name is based on the legendary circus elephant Jumbo, something not many people nowadays remember or know (his proper name is given as Jumbo Jr., while "Dumbo" is a mean nickname given to him by the other elephants).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rockadoodle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rockadoodle">Rockadoodle</a></em>, Pinky is to Colonel Tom Parker what Chanticleer is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>. Young kids who grew up in the 90's probably knew who Elvis was, but the Colonel, not so much. The name/character of Chanticleer himself is from one of Chaucer's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCanterburyTales">The Canterbury Tales</a></em>, who took it from the body of folk tales about him and Reynard the fox. But you would have to be a medievalist to make that connection.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em>:
<ul><li> Thanks to its very quick one-scene usage as an in-joke, many people mistakenly believe that "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" was written by Elton John and Tim Rice for the movie. It doesn't help that the song is used briefly in the Broadway musical and on the <em>Rhythm of the Pridelands</em> CD.
</li><li> The film includes a notable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastingGag">Casting Gag</a> in its voice cast; Simba's parents Mufasa and Sarabi (the King and Queen of Pride Rock) are voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesEarlJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesEarlJones">James Earl Jones</a> and Madge Sinclair, who also played the King and Queen of an African kingdom in the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EddieMurphy">Eddie Murphy</a> comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ComingToAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ComingToAmerica">Coming to America</a></em>. But <em>The Lion King</em> went on to become a major classic in its own right, and it's now considerably more famous than <em>Coming to America</em>. As a result, the gag is lost on many viewers today.
</li></ul></li><li> While older audiences and rock fans likely know of the song, the target audience for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobSquarePantsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpongeBobSquarePantsMovie">The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie</a></em> typically know of "Goofy-Goober Rock" before the original 1980s song "I Wanna Rock" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister">Twisted Sister</a>.

<ul><li> Many Hollywood actors of the 1930s and 1940s are more familiar to younger generations who never saw their actual movies from seeing them appear as caricatures in old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> cartoons.
</li><li> Kenneth Alford's 1914 tune "Colonel Bogey March" is now best known as "that whistling tune from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBridgeOnTheRiverKwai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBridgeOnTheRiverKwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a></em>." During World War II, the song acquired parody lyrics and became known as "Hitler Has Only Got One Ball".
</li><li> The classic 1940s-era shorts by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em> were often parodies of contemporary films, many of which are today mostly forgotten, contrary to the Stooges themselves. The best-known example may be "Men in Black" (a takeoff on a now-forgotten doctors-and-nurses tale called <em>Men in White</em>).
<ul><li> In a similar case, it affected former third Stooge Joe Besser as well: While he was quite popular for various comedic roles during his time — most notably his "whiny sissy" act that he carried over to his Stooge role — today, he's known for <em>nothing</em> but being a replacement third Stooge (and a subpar one at that).
</li><li> Well, Joe Besser is also remembered as "Stinky" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello">Abbott and Costello</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em> (1980) lifts, often word for word, the story of a 1950s disaster movie called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroHour">Zero Hour</a></em> (itself a remake of a Canadian television movie). As a matter of fact, the Zucker brothers bought the rights to <em>Zero Hour!</em> so they could use its plot so closely without being sued. However, <em>Airplane!</em> is better remembered as a general parody of '70s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterMovie">disaster films</a>, specially the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airport">Airport</a></em> series, which jump-started the craze. And many younger viewers haven't even heard of those films, especially <em>Airport</em>, as <em>Airplane!</em> was a pretty thorough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">Genre-Killer</a>.
<ul><li> Ethel Merman is best known nowadays for appearing as an asylum inmate who claimed to be her.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes">60 Minutes</a></em> segment <em>Point/Counterpoint</em>, where a liberal and a conservative debate current events, and its conservative commentator <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_J._Kilpatrick">James Kilpatrick<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, only live on in the public consciousness from Kilpatrick's parody of himself in the film.

</div><ul><li> The joke with a copilot who's played by (and seemingly really <em>is</em>) basketball player <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KareemAbdulJabbar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KareemAbdulJabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> is a particularly silly reference to the original <em>Zero Hour!</em>, where the copilot was played by Elroy 'Crazylegs' Hirsch, a popular football player at the time who was trying to break into film. The number of people who remember both <em>Zero Hour!</em> and Hirsch today is pretty small.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles">Blazing Saddles</a></em>, the villain Hedley Lamarr is always correcting people who call him "Hedy". There are fewer people today who know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HedyLamarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HedyLamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a> (who starred in 19 films, had six husbands, and whose work in radar technology in WWII served as a key precursor to the development of cell phones, wi-fi and GPS, making her the Mother of the Cellular Age) than who know <em>Blazing Saddles</em> — or who know Hedy LaRue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowToSucceedInBusinessWithoutReallyTrying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowToSucceedInBusinessWithoutReallyTrying">How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying</a></em>, a more direct takeoff on Lamarr.
<ul><li> Ditto jazz musician Mongo Santamaria, who is perhaps best known today as the punchline of a throwaway joke involving the character Mongo in <em>Blazing Saddles</em>.
</li><li> Almost nobody in the movie's target audience would have known that, by Hollywood cliché, Native Americans were played by Jewish actors. Hence the movie's Yiddish-speaking Indians.
</li><li> The Waco Kid's famous speech about how and why he ended his time as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestGunInTheWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastestGunInTheWest">Fastest Gun in the West</a> and turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">depressed drunk</a> is a spoof of a speech given by a character in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959">The Twilight Zone (1959)</a></em>. The enduring fame and popularity of <em>Blazing Saddles</em> has meant that far more people are familiar with the Waco Kid's scene in the film than with the source material.
</li><li> Few people know who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RandolphScott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RandolphScott">Randolph Scott</a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dix">Richard Dix<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> Also by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks">Mel Brooks</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungFrankenstein">Young Frankenstein</a></em> makes it easy for people to find some unintentional comedy in many scenes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frankenstein1931" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Frankenstein1931">Frankenstein (1931)</a></em> (and on a lesser level, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrideOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrideOfFrankenstein">Bride of Frankenstein</a></em>). And few viewers realize that as well as being a general pastiche of Frankenstein films, it lifts its plot and several whole scenes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfFrankenstein">Son of Frankenstein</a></em> in particular.
</li><li> Yet again from Mel Brooks, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodMenInTights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodMenInTights">Robin Hood: Men in Tights</a></em> is probably better remembered than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodPrinceOfThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodPrinceOfThieves">Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</a></em>, the movie it was most closely parodying. Also, most people don't realize that the utterly ridiculous facial expressions that Cary Elwes makes throughout the movie are actually a spot-on imitation of those made by Errol Flynn in the classic <em>Adventures of Robin Hood</em> (1938).
</li><li> Him again: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers">The Producers</a></em>'s "Springtime for Hitler" scene features a portion where a group of people form a swastika, an image lifted straight from Nazi propaganda film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TriumphOfTheWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TriumphOfTheWill">Triumph of the Will</a></em> (albeit on a much smaller scale). For obvious reasons, the latter is only watched by film students and neo-Nazis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></em>:
<ul><li> The title character is a parody of Wernher von Braun, the ex-Nazi scientist who worked for NASA. Ex-Nazi scientists were also a stock character in the 50s.
</li><li> It is an adaptation of the now long forgotten <em>dramatic</em> Peter George novel <em>Red Alert</em>. Nuclear holocaust stories were popular in the 50s. The film was originally going to be a straight adaptation before getting turned into a darkly comic satire.
</li><li> The film <em>Fail-Safe</em>, released around the same time, used the identical concept played straight. (In fact, it was based on a novel itself, and the author of <em>Red Alert</em> sued the author of <em>Fail-Safe</em> for plagiarism...) Today if it's remembered at all, people tend to assume it's boring and stodgy in comparison, but it's actually a critically acclaimed drama.
</li><li> The title character's metal hand is more recognizable today than that of Rotwang in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Metropolis">Metropolis</a></em>, the character which it homages.
</li></ul></li><li> Several scenes from the spy thriller <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarathonMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MarathonMan">Marathon Man</a></em> ("Is it safe?") are arguably more famous for being parodied than the movie itself.
</li><li> You are far more likely to encounter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CitizenKane">Citizen Kane</a></em> through a parody or reference in a children's cartoon years before you even hear of the film itself.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">Austin Powers</a> franchise parodies a lot in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> franchise, some that everyone would get (Random Task throwing a shoe), while others are obscure enough that most viewers wouldn't get unless they were a Bond fan. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BurtBacharach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BurtBacharach">Burt Bacharach</a> provided music for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale1967" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale1967">Casino Royale (1967)</a></em>, which is why he makes an appearance in the first Austin Powers film. Austin himself is a parody of Jason King, a suave hipster secret agent from the British TV shows <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DepartmentS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DepartmentS">Department S</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JasonKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JasonKing">his own eponymous spin-off</a>, who is now largely forgotten even in Britain. Austin also parodies the titular character of the short-lived British spy show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamAdamantLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamAdamantLives">Adam Adamant Lives!</a></em>
</li><li> Far more people nowadays have seen the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> films than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFistedTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoFistedTales">the '30s adventure films</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreThrowback">that inspired them</a>. To the point where one of the main criticisms of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndianaJonesAndTheKingdomOfTheCrystalSkull">Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></em> was that it didn't follow the '30s adventure template, even though the production team was trying to do the same thing to the '50s sci-fi shows. Recursively enough, it's closer to '70s parodies of the template (the crystal skulls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">Ancient Astronauts</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">The Greys</a> especially are '70s tropes).
</li><li> Try showing some German expressionist movies to someone who isn't already familiar with the genre, and see how long it takes for them to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a>.
</li><li> While not a parody, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertDeNiro">Robert de Niro</a>'s famous "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTalkinToMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouTalkinToMe">You Talkin' to Me?</a>?" line from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TaxiDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TaxiDriver">Taxi Driver</a></em> was a reference to the 1953 Western <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shane">Shane</a></em>, where the title character is called out.
<div class="indent"><strong>Shane:</strong> You speakin' to me? <br/><strong>Chris Calloway:</strong> I don't see nobody else standin' there.
</div><ul><li> Other reports claim that De Niro was inspired by a standup routine he saw in New York.
</li><li> Some people who grew up watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> will associate it with The Goodfeathers, who occasionally used this catchphrase.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SaturdayMorningBreakfastCereal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SaturdayMorningBreakfastCereal">Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal</a></em> once had a biker accidentally getting the tattoo "LOVE/HATS" but didn't mind because he actually really loved hats.

Also, more people know the film's version of Ezekiel 25:17 rather than the actual Bible passage.
</li><li> Most people would recognize scenes from films such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape">The Great Escape</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDamBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDamBusters">The Dam Busters</a></em> than would recognize the films themselves. For example, the "bouncing bombs" or the "throwing a ball against the wall in a prison cell" are widely recognized by people who have never seen either of those.
<ul><li> The fact that the attack on the Death Star sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope</a></em> is a shot-for-shot homage to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDamBusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDamBusters">The Dam Busters</a></em> will confuse people a bit though.

As the Broadway musical hasn't been run regularly since the Kennedy administration (hence why "Camelot" is a common name for that period), the Camelot sequence comes off as pretty random to modern viewers, as does the idea of naming the musical after a comparatively innocuous line from said sequence.

<ul><li> In the early chapters of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em>, when Alice is trying to "sort her head out", she recites two children's verses, which she names "How Doth the Little..." and "You Are Old, Father William." Contemporaries of Carroll would have recognised these as parodies of "Against Idleness and Mischief" by Isaac Watts and "The Old Man's Comforts and How He Gained Them" by Robert Southey. These days, while many people know Carroll's parody of Southey's verse, fewer know that it is in fact a parody, and fewer still could name or recite the original. Some verses that Carroll parodied even scholars aren't sure of because they are now so obscure. In fact the only one that hasn't caused the Weird Al Effect is "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Bat" ("Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star").
<ul><li> Speaking of Southey, his poem "The Battle of Blenheim" originated the familiar album cover trope of the kid playing innocently with a skull.
</li><li> And few modern readers of <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em> would know the tune<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9op7r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9op7r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9op7r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"My Heart and Lute"</span> the White Knight's "A-Sitting on a Gate" is supposed to be sung to, even though Alice points out that "the tune <em>isn't</em> his own invention."
</li><li> Much of the wording in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> was meant to be surreal and strange, but has actually made its way into common parlance so that it seems perfectly normal to a modern reader <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10lq5b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10lq5b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10lq5b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(not unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">the Bard's contributions to the English language)</a></span>. For instance, Alice says "Let's pretend," in the beginning. At the time, "pretend" meant "to lie or deceive", so "Let's pretend" sounded <em>very</em> odd. Now, thanks to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a></em>, the meaning of the word has changed quite a bit. A few words, such as "chortle", were coined outright and would have been nonsense to <em>Alice</em>'s first readers; today we think nothing of them. Because of their origin they could be considered a double instance of the trope — very few people will realize they came from Alice, and further, even if they do, they won't realize that the original references in Alice were parodies themselves! <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> is its own Weird Al Effect, one could say.
</li><li> Check out the wonderful book "Annotated Alice" where famed (and late) mathemagician Martin Gardner takes the time to annotate virtually <em>every</em> cultural reference made. Suffice to say there are at least as many words in the annotations as there are in the original stories. One particularly in-depth aside takes up a full two-page spread, written in 8-point font. In a large-format hardback.
</li><li> <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em> has a nice example. <em>The Walrus and the Carpenter</em>, the poem sung by the twins, is a parody of <em>The Dream of Eugene Aram</em>, which is about an elementary school teacher who is convicted of murder. This was actually a famous and still controversial trial from the 18th century. Eugene Aram (17041759) was a groundbreaking philologist, who worked as a schoolmaster early in his career. In 1744, a friend of Aram called Daniel Clark disappeared, and was thought to have either run away with stolen goods or to have been the victim of foul play. Aram was arrested as a suspect because he was found in possession of some of the stolen goods. There was no evidence connecting him to crime, so he was released. In 1758, a skeleton was found in a cave, and authorities suspected it belonged to the still-missing Daniel Clark. Aram was arrested again and was put on trial for the murder of Clark. He tried to explain in his defense that there was no proof that the skeleton actually belonged to Daniel Clark, and that the "evidence" against him was circumstancial. He was convicted anyway and executed. He supposedly confessed before the execution that he hated Daniel Clark, because he was a close friend of his, but he had been sleeping with Aram's wife. The murder case inspired a ballad by Thomas Hood, a novel by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardBulwerLytton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdwardBulwerLytton">Edward Bulwer-Lytton</a>, and a theatrical play by William Gorman Wills. The fame of the case is partly based on the perceived duality between Aram's brilliant work as a scholar and his apparent guilt in a violent murder, and partly on suspicions that he may not have performed the murder after all. The "evidence" in the trial were indeed flimsy, and a key witness against Aram happened to be another main suspect in the murder of Daniel Clark. Some researchers view the other man as the most likely murderer.
</li><li> The Mad Hatter was already a trope before Carroll came along. Hatters used mercury to cure felt, and would sometimes lose cognitive function from inhaling the fumes, so mad hatters was a trope somewhat analogous to the modern trope of insane postal workers. The book is the only surviving use of the trope, so modern readers assume it's an original character concept. Though interestingly, while he was a hatter, and mad, he was never outright called "The Mad Hatter" in the actual story, just "The Hatter".
</li><li> The beast in Carroll's poem "Jabberwocky" is more commonly known by that name since most works that reference it use that instead of the creature's <em>actual</em> name: Jabberwock.
</li><li> The phrase "grinning like a Cheshire cat" has been dated to the late 18th century, eighty years before the novel, although no-one is entirely sure what its origins are. It is thought that it may be connected to the dairy farms of Cheshire, and the past reputation of the area for its "abundance of milk and cream". It was the pre-eminent milk, cheese, and cream producing county of England for several centuries. Others have pointed that Lewis Carrol himself was born and raised in Cheshire, and may have been inspired by the 16th century sandstone carving of a grinning cat, on the west face of St Wilfrid's Church tower in Grappenhall, a village adjacent to his birthplace in Daresbury. A photo of Grappenhall's grinning cat is available <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire_Cat#/media/File:Sandstone_carving_of_%27Cheshire_Cat%27,_St_Wilfrid%27s_Church,_Grappenhall.jpg">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li></ul></li><li> An even older literary example is Cervantes' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em>, which parodied a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance">Chivalric Romances</a> from the time period, especially one called <em>Amadis of Gaul</em>. None of these are read any more, except by scholars. The original version of <em>Amadis of Gaul</em> had been written by an anonymous writer in the 14th century, but the work was thought to be incomplete. Throughout the 16th century, several different writers (Spanish, Italian, German, and French) added new volumes to the story. By the 1590s, there were about 24 volumes of Amadis in circulation around Europe. They were of varying quality and full of internal contradictions, due to the different styles and backgrounds of the writers involved. There were also other Chivalric Romances which copied tropes and ideas from <em>Amadis</em>. Writing in the early 17th century, Cervantes decided to satirize both the genre and its main source.
<ul><li> Miguel de Cervantes was the victim of a trope misunderstanding when an anonymous writer calling himself "Avellaneda" published a false sequel to <em>Don Quixote</em>. The sequel completely missed the cleverness of Cervantes' references that mocked tropes of the chivalric genre (the noble knight's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">Unlimited Knapsack</a>, the magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingPotion">Healing Potion</a>), instead choosing to write a slapstick and completely unfunny book that no one ever reads now. The book is signed as "Alonso Fernandez de Avellaneda, born in Tordesillas", but that is a fake name, and the prologue is riffed with insults to Cervantes and unashamed flattering to his main rival, Lope de Vega. Apparently at the time the book came out the writing style was famous enough to identify the author without need of giving his real name. Given the volume of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> in Cervantes' canon sequel, it is more than likely that Cervantes knew perfectly well who he was. However, precisely for this reason nobody bothered to ever write down Avellaneda's real identity. Now, 400 years later, Cervantes and Don Quixote are as famous as ever, while we only know the other as "that guy that insulted Cervantes in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a>". Interestingly, in Cervantes Part 2 of Don Quixote, Quixote is infuriated that there is an imposter using his name. At one point Quixote meets Don Alvaro Tarfe (a character created by Avellaneda) and "gets him to swear an affidavit that he has never met the true Don Quixote before".
</li><li> Another case of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em> is that both books were a satire and, as such, contained a lot of references not only to now disappeared chivalry books (the second part contains extensive parodies of <em>Tirant lo Blanch</em>, one of the better chivalry books and a Cervantes favorite) but to Spain's popular culture at the 17th century: (respectful) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">caricatures of then-famous celebrities</a>, unrespectful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">caricatures of contemporary writers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">quotes from Cervantes's favorite poets</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfAphorisms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurricaneOfAphorisms">popular proverbs</a>, then contemporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleEntendre">phrases that can be taken in at least two different ways</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnotatedEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAnnotatedEdition">all of them completely unknown for the modern reader if not by the notes provided in the reprints</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">Cervantes's book was incredibly funny when he published it, but it is very difficult to see it like this now</a>.
</li><li> Another of the difficulties of the novel is that at some points Quixote and his squire are merely listeners to someone else's story. A number of secondary characters narrate at length their own past experiences and adventures, which often have nothing to do with chivalric romance at all. They are Cervante's takes on other genres. The most famous of these sidetales of the novel is "The Man Who Was Recklessly Curious", which introduced the proverbial character "Lothario". The story deals with a man's obsession, and how it ruins his own life and everyone else's. A man called Anselmo is married to the faithful Camilla, but obsesses that she may cheat on him and wants to test her fidelity. He keeps pressuring his friend Lothario to try to seduce her, though Lothario thinks that his friend has gone mad. Anselmo then effectively plays matchmaker between Lothario and Camilla, until the two of them are actually in love. They are having their affair, without Anselmo realizing that his "test" actually worked. A series of later misunderstandings leads the couple to flee in fear of their lives, while Camilla's maid flees in fear towards another destination. Abandoned by everyone, Anselmo dies alone due to his own grief.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Voltaire">Voltaire</a>'s classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Candide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Candide">Candide</a></em> is a harsh satire aimed at the optimistic teachings of Gottfried Leibniz... who would only have been remembered as a mathematician had <em>Candide</em> not proven so popular. And they have forgotten the more likely target of Voltaire's satire, the now still more obscure <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_von_Wolff">Christian Wolff<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who combined views as optimistic as Leibniz's with a career nearly as random as Pangloss's.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>'s collection of stories starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence">Tommy and Tuppence</a>, <em>Partners in Crime</em>, each story is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Homage">Homage</a> to a different crime-writer. While many of them are still famous today, a few are now hopelessly obscure. (Anyone familiar with the blind detective Thornley Colton? Anyone?)
</li><li> Stella Gibbons's comic novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdComfortFarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdComfortFarm">Cold Comfort Farm</a></em> has outlived the rustic romances it parodied.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em> was a parody of the then-popular genre of journeys to distant lands. It is now a standalone classic. It contains innumerable digs at people and ideas of Swift's time, which go right past modern readers. This has led many people to think of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JonathanSwift">Jonathan Swift</a> as nothing more than a writer of a whimsical children's tale, when in reality he was a vicious and biting satirist who regularly savaged society in his writings. One of his other better-known works is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AModestProposal">A Modest Proposal</a>", where he satirically suggests that the best way to handle all the starving children in Ireland was to simply eat them, reasoning that since the British had already exploited Ireland in every other way, the only thing to do now is go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">humanitarian</a>.
<ul><li> Certain sections of <em>Several Voyages to Remote Nations of the World by Lemuel Gulliver</em> are also parodying other works. His Laputa and Balnibari are much more directly mocking Francis Bacon's New Atlantis. And, strangely, the ideas of each of the 4 places he goes may have been taken from an old Japanese story, or collection of stories, that talked about tiny people, giants, and horses. Whether this is truth or an extraordinary coincidence unclear, but considering how Japan is the only place Gulliver goes to that Swift treats with any kind of reality (in addition to being the only real place Gulliver goes, and the only place where he doesn't learn the language) there may be something to it.
</li><li> When Hayao Miyazaki made a film called <em>Laputa: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CastleInTheSky">Castle in the Sky</a></em>, he apparently didn't understand that Swift's floating island of idiot-savants was meant as a scathing satire of scientists and the British crown, so simply presented it as a place of advanced technology and learning. He also had no way of knowing that the name of "Laputa" was derived from one of the worst possible epithets in Spanish, for the sake of a joke about etymology at the expense of the scientists Swift was lampooning. Consequently, most foreign releases of the anime elide the first word of the title. "Laputa" literally means "the whore" in Spanish.
</li><li> Most of the Laputa chapter is devoted to mocking scientists and other would-be intellectuals of Swift's era. The male masters of Laputa have devoted their entire lives to astronomy, mathematics, music, and technology, but they have little to no skills in any other area. They are complete failures when it comes to designing buildings or designing clothes, to the point that none of their clothes fit and none of their buildings have any symmetry. They are often so lost in their own thoughts, that they have to employ servants just in order to bring them back to reality for a few minutes, or to remind them that they have to eat, or urinate. These "intellectual" masters are married, but pay little attention to their wives or their needs. So their wives have to find lovers among the people who visit Laputa, and adultery is actually widespread in their society. The husbands don't pay attention, even when the adulterous act happens in front of their eyes. Lost in their own world.
</li></ul></li><li> One interesting detail in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatDivorce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGreatDivorce">The Great Divorce</a></em> is that Heaven is so "solid" that souls coming directly from Earth or Hell are unable to move anything—even leaves or blades of grass. In the preface, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> credits a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFi">Sci-Fi</a> short story for giving him the idea: the protagonist of the story <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">time travels</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalMutability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemporalMutability">the unchangeable past</a> and finds "raindrops that would pierce him like bullets and sandwiches that no strength could bite". Lewis couldn't remember the name of the story or its author, but it has been speculated to be the "The Man Who Lived Backwards," by the never-famous Charles F. Hall, and thus, the only reason why some might even know of his name.
<ul><li> The title and purpose of <em>The Great Divorce</em> serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against the now obscure-in-comparison <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamBlake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamBlake">William Blake</a> — which was <em>itself</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against the doubly obscure <em>Heaven and Hell</em> by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmanuelSwedenborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmanuelSwedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Although the modern vampire dates back to Lord Ruthven of John William Polidori's 1819 short story "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheVampyre">The Vampyre</a>", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a> is still the archetypical vampire. Even then, it is the Dracula in adaptations people think of, rather than the original book character.
<ul><li> Only if they don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">sparkle</a>.
</li><li> For instance, many people reading <em>Dracula</em> will be surprised to see the title character walking around in daylight.
</li><li> For that matter, many people familiar with Lord Ruthven might not realize that this tragic Romantic figure was a none-too-kind dig at the author's boss, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordByron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LordByron">Lord Byron</a>. And Polidori actually borrowed the name "Lord Ruthven" from the novel <em>Glenarvon</em> (1816) by Lady Caroline Lamb, where Lord Ruthven is a rakish villain who seduces and corrupts innocent women. Both Polidori's and Lamb's Ruthvens are unflattering depictions of Lord Byron, because they both felt that Byron betrayed their trust. Byron had spent quite sometime trying to romance the (already married) Lamb. Once she fell for him, he quickly broke of their affair and rejected her increasingly desperate attempts to get him to bed her again. Leading to them publicly quarreling about their love life, and making their relationship one of the worst kept secrets in the British Empire. Lamb gained a rather scandalous reputation in the process. Polidori dreamed of becoming a famous writer like Byron and initially viewed Byron as his friend (and possible role model), not just as an employer. Until Byron started publicly mocking any work written by Polidori, stressing his superiority in physical, combat, and literary skills over Polidori, and getting impatient with Polidori's periods of ill health. He fired the young physician after about a year of service. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">Broken Pedestal</a>-process changed the way Polidori perceived Byron.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey">Northanger Abbey</a></em> seems to be more widely studied and read than the gothic fiction of Ann Radcliffe which it parodies.
<ul><li> In fact, for a long time scholars weren't even sure that the works she parodied even existed. The novel was published in 1817, but had actually been written in the late 1790s. Austen had chosen to include humorous references to seven then-recently published novels, most of which were soon out of print and forgotten due to the changing preferences of the 19th-century audience. Soon neither scholars, nor readers could understand what Austen was referring to. In the 1920s, two literary historians tracked down the forgotten works and revived interest in them. All seven have seen reprints in the 20th and 21st century, mostly because Austen happened to mention them.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of 18th century poets such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleyCibber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColleyCibber">Colley Cibber</a> are mainly known even to academics for being mocked and parodied by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlexanderPope">Alexander Pope</a> in <em>The Dunciad</em> and other works.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TenSixtySixAndAllThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TenSixtySixAndAllThat">1066 and All That</a></em>, a 1930 parody of the patriotic Whiggish school history books of the early 20th century, has long outlasted the works it is parodying.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series was partially inspired by the time-honored British boarding school genre. <em>Harry Potter</em> is now way, <em>way</em> more famous than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomBrownsSchooldays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomBrownsSchooldays">Tom Brown's Schooldays</a></em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11pflu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11pflu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11pflu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Or indeed the jolly hockeysticks boarding school yarns of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EnidBlyton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EnidBlyton">Enid Blyton</a> or Frank Richards' Greyfriars with the abominable fat boy Billy Bunter.</span>
<ul><li> While on the topic of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>: A lot of the creatures, spells, and other magical phenomena in the book have their roots in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanYouThink">much, much older</a> literature. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasiliskAndCockatrice">Basilisks</a>, for example, are at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanPrint">Older Than Print</a>. However, with the exception of elements used frequently in modern works (werewolves, for example), most <em>Harry Potter</em> fans aren't fully aware of how little of Harry's world originated with J.K. Rowling. (The exception is that if you are even vaguely aware of alchemy or one of the other works that used it, then you would know at least that Rowling did not invent the Philosopher's Stone.)
<ul><li> And Nicolas Flamel (c. 1340-1418) was a real person, who supposedly <em>did</em> invent the Philosopher's Stone. The real Flamel was a successful French scribe and manuscript-seller. He gained a large fortune for his era, owned much real estate property, and had the reputation of a generous philanthropist. In the 17th century (2 centuries following his death), a number of texts started claiming that he was a fabulously wealthy and immortal alchemist. His reputation has since grown mostly due to the legends about him.
</li></ul></li><li> But then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomBrownsSchooldays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TomBrownsSchooldays">Tom Brown's Schooldays</a></em> also gave rise to that grand antihero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Flashman">Flashman</a>.
<ul><li> Of course, around here Flashman himself is best known for being parodied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a>, HERO OF THE IMPERIUM!
</li></ul></li><li> A good number of elements in the series are meant to parody aspects of British culture that are little-known beyond it. A classic example is the rather funky conversion method for wizarding currency (seventeen sickles to a galleon, twenty-nine knuts to a sickle), which confuses most foreigners but was a pretty apt parody of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coins_of_the_pound_sterling#Pre-decimal_coinage">the incredibly convoluted pre-decimalization coinage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that Britain phased out in the 70s.

Many scenes in Harry Potter appear to be close to direct copies of scenes in The Worst Witch, including things such as the broomstick lessons and getting into trouble for smuggling an animal into the school. The first book was published in 1974, and actually written well before that. While The Worst Witch is not really, with new books still being published and selling well, along with multiple TV adaptations and most recently a theatre production, there's no question which series is better known.

</li><li> Robert Michael Ballantyne's 1858 novel <em>The Coral Island</em> features three boys living in harmony on an island after a shipwreck. The novel used to be a real classic in the early 20th century. However, it also used to really annoy a certain William Golding, so he wrote a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of it, complete with names ripped out of Ballantyne's work.

(Only one of these works has a page.)
<ul><li> <em>Lord of the Flies</em> is in a similar situation to <em>The Cold Equations</em>, in that it's essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructiveParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructiveParody">Deconstructive Parody</a> of a genre that was widespread at the time, but doesn't really exist anymore. There were countless novels about British schoolboys going into hostile environments with no parental support, and using basic survival skills, the power of teamwork, and their stiff-upper-lip courage and wit to become the masters of their surroundings. (It also doubled as a sort of pro-colonial narrative, since the message was essentially "Brits are better than the savages and can build civilization anywhere!", which was obviously popular at the time.) <em>Lord of the Flies</em> turned out to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreKiller">Genre-Killer</a> by arguing that the boys would actually quickly descend to the level of "savages" and break down into factionalism, infighting, and murder, and nowadays no story plays the original tropes straight anymore.

Many readers may believe that the rune was the author's own invention or (if they are familiar with St. Patrick's Lorica/Breastplate) that it was her own variation of the original. The truth is that the exact wording of the rune was taken from the longer "St. Patrick's Hymn Before Tara", written by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clarence_Mangan">James Clarence Mangan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a nineteenth-century Irish poet.

However, the archetype ended up dying out relatively soon after, while <em>Cold Equations</em> has been reprinted often as a sci-fi classic. As a result most people who read it nowadays don't have the context behind the story and are just astounded by the laughably short-sighted spaceship design.

They are both a direct parody of Bob Vila and Norm Abram's screen presence. In addition, scenes outside of <em>Tool Time</em> point out how most of the actual renovation work is done by a trained crew and that the hosts' contributions are mostly symbolic. In-universe the show was occasionally noted as a knockoff, and Tim had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnknownRival">Unknown Rival</a> relationship with Villa when he guest starred. However, as <em>Home Improvement</em> has managed to remain popular and remembered in popular culture more than 20 years after it first aired, while Vila and Abram have been eclipsed by newer, younger talent in the "Home Improvement" genre such as Ty Pennington and Mike Holmes, the fact that Tool Time is a parody is largely lost on those who watch the reruns today.

By the time the series was revived in 2005, there hadn't been a working police box anywhere in the UK for over 20 years<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12dba7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12dba7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12dba7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Since the show's revival, a genuine working Police Box has been installed in the Bournemouth suburb of Boscombe. The council admitted at the time that it's there as a tourist attraction as much as it is a means of calling the police.</span>, and a line of expository dialogue was required in the first new episode to explain the TARDIS's appearance. Indeed, the TARDIS is usually the first thing anyone thinks of upon seeing a picture of a police box.

This is occasionally lampshaded, with mixed success/cringeworthiness, in UK media.
</li><li> Possibly the only <em>legally binding</em> case of the Weird Al Effect: The BBC trademarked the look of the TARDIS in 1996. The Metropolitan Police challenged it, and lost, with the judge saying that it was far more recognizable as a symbol of <em>Doctor Who</em> than as a symbol of the police. (The fact that the police had never attempted to trademark it themselves over the course of 40 years also counted against them.)

</li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em>, most fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeofComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeofComicBooks">the Dark Age</a> Batman regard the 1960s series as the representative of that era's Batman, when actually it was widely regarded as an intentionally over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek parody of the comic book. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">That Other Wiki</a>, the comic later turned up the camp because of the TV show's success.
<ul><li> That didn't stop parents from taking their kids to see the later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> movies, expecting the same style as the Adam West series. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Boy were they in</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids">for a surprise</a>...
<ul><li> The '60s TV series was also a parody of the '40s <em>Batman</em> film serials, especially the cliffhanger narrations.

The cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse">Danger Mouse</a></em> parodies or gives a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DangerMan">Danger Man</a></em>. Both are much better remembered.
<ul><li> The theme for the American release <em>Secret Agent</em> is a staple of oldies radio.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, the visual similarity between Spike and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyIdol">Billy Idol</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>.

Although the show did occasionally parody <em>James Bond</em>, it spoofed the previously mentioned shows far more than they did <em>James Bond</em>.
<ul><li> A more obvious example of the Weird Al Effect is in the title sequence to <em>Get Smart</em>. Few people these days realise that the iconic "closing doors/phone box at end of corridor" is a quite deliberate parody on similar sequences in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUNCLE">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></em>.... many people know it better these days from <em>Get Smart</em>!
</li><li> Maxwell Smart's famous voice was inspired by William Powell's performance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThinMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThinMan">The Thin Man</a></em>. And by extension, so is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The children's TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LazyTown">LazyTown</a></em> has the song "Cooking by the Book", which was eclipsed by <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/K5tVbVu9Mkg">its comic mashup remix<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with the hip-hop song "Step Yo Game Up" featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilJon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LilJon">Lil Jon</a>.

</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> episode had George wanting Bozo the Clown for his girlfriend's son's birthday party. These days, Bozo is all but forgotten, and yet by the mid-1990s it was regarded as painfully uncool.
</li><li> People who grew up in the 1980s might be familiar with the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBelvedere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBelvedere">Mr. Belvedere</a>, starring Christopher Hewett in the title role. However, many of them might not be aware that this was based on the Clifton Webb movie <em>Sitting Pretty</em>, which was in turn based upon the novel <em>Belvedere</em>, both from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForties">The '40s</a>.
</li><li> The TV show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Blackadder">Blackadder</a></em> is now better known than the Robert Louis Stevenson novel <em>The Black Arrow</em>, which the title is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to and which the first series parodied.
<ul><li> The intro of the second season features a snake crawling over the opening titles, and being dragged back into shot by black-gloved hands when it leaves the screen too quickly. Hardly anyone nowadays knows this is a parody of the opening titles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IClaudius">I, Claudius</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Once upon a time, there was a UK game show called <em>If I Ruled The World</em>. It inspired another game show called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Parlamentet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Parlamentet">Parlamentet</a></em>. <em>If I Ruled The World</em> stopped after two seasons — <em>Parlamentet</em>, however, is still going strong. In Scandinavia, admittedly, but twenty-two seasons deserve a mention.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Shows</a> become an example of a variation of this trope when a revived version of the show becomes more popular than the original version. Some examples:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> has been a fixture on daytime TV since 1972 and is likely the only version known to most people today—but the original version was also very popular in its time, airing in both daytime and primetime from 1956 to 1965. Additionally, when producer Mark Goodson updated <em>The Price Is Right</em> for the revival, he intended to incorporate elements of the most popular game show on TV at the time—<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LetsMakeADeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LetsMakeADeal">Let's Make a Deal</a></em>. The <em>Deal</em> connection was largely forgotten... although with a new version of that show now airing (on the same network as <em>Price</em> and as a companion piece, no less), the connection may become clearer once again.
<ul><li> With the two shows having held a crossover week in the 2015-16 season, it seems mission accomplished.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MatchGame">Match Game</a></em>. The 1970s version is the most popular due to the funny and suggestive nature of the questions. However, the original version—despite being much more sedate and tame—also had a long run on NBC from 1962 to 1969.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PressYourLuck">Press Your Luck</a></em>, one of the most popular game shows of the 1980s, was actually based on a short-lived game show called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SecondChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SecondChance">Second Chance</a></em> that aired in 1977.
</li><li> Before the still-running version with Alex Trebek started up in 1984, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> was hosted by Art Fleming for 10 seasons (1964-1974), followed by a short-lived reboot in 1978. (Yes, children of the '80s, <em>that's</em> who that guy is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a>'s "I Lost On Jeopardy" video...)
</li><li> Despite what its producers would have you think, Pat Sajak and Vanna White were <em>not</em> the original host/hostess tandem on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>  that would be Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford. Still, Chuck ends up a subversion, since he would go on to become famous for many other popular game shows, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrabble">Scrabble</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveConnection">Love Connection</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lingo">Lingo</a></em>.
<ul><li> This came back to bite one group of contestants on another Woolery show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greed">Greed</a></em>, who were asked to pick out the one game show Woolery had not hosted, with the possible answers being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrabble">Scrabble</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveConnection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoveConnection">Love Connection</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SingledOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SingledOut">Singled Out</a></em>. The contestants chose <em>Wheel</em>, when the correct answer was <em>Singled Out</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WheelOfFortune">Wheel of Fortune</a></em>, many people may remember the jingle "I'm a Wheel Watcher", used in commercials (and sometimes even on the show itself) for most of the 80s and 90s. What most people may not realize is that the song is a rewrite of "I'm a Girl Watcher", a 1960s blue-eyed soul song.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>'s <em>The Continental</em> recurring sketch with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken">Christopher Walken</a> is actually based on a real TV show. <em>The Continental</em> was a short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> program that aired Saturday nights during the 1952-53 season, and starred Renzo Cesana as the title character. Its target audience was lonely, dateless women (though when it moved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC</a>, it aired in the daytime for lonely, bored housewives). The combination of the subjective camera angles and the Continental's charm was designed to make these women believe they were being romanced through their TV sets. The <em>SNL</em> version is exactly like that, except Walken's Continental has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Handsome Lech</a>-cum-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>-cum-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a>-cum-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a>.
<ul><li> Truly, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">Poe's Law</a> in effect.
</li><li> Similarly, more people recognize Mike Myers' "Simon" sketches than "Simon in the Land of Drawings", the British series that it spoofed.
<ul><li> Not if they are old enough to have watched <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainKangaroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CaptainKangaroo">Captain Kangaroo</a></em> as kids.

</li><li> When Spanish dictator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FranciscoFranco">Francisco Franco</a> was on his deathbed in 1975, news programs would sometimes update his condition on slow news days. Sometimes, these reports would simply state that "Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still alive." He finally died in November of that year. Then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChevyChase">Chevy Chase</a> started to feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisJustIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisJustIn">This Just In!</a> reports that "Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead." The catch phrase remained in the public consciousness long after the countdown to Franco's death.
</li><li> Weekend Update's <em>Point/Counterpoint</em> ("Jane, you ignorant slut!"), was a parody of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixtyMinutes">60 Minutes</a></em> segment that aired in the seventies until it was replaced by <em>A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney</em>. The segment was also parodied by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em> ("I say, let 'em crash!").
</li><li> The <em>Dear Sister</em> digital short, where everyone shoots each other while Imogen Heap's "Hide and Seek" plays, is probably much more famous than the scene from the second season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC">The O.C.</a></em> that it was spoofing.
</li><li> Not many people know that the nickname for the original cast, the "Not Ready for Prime Time Players", was a reference to a competing show called <em>Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note148bom');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note148bom" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note148bom');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">That show was why SNL was originally called just <em>Saturday Night</em>, taking the name <em>Saturday Night Live</em> after Cosell's show was cancelled</span>, which had a trio of comedy performers called the "Prime Time Players"  all three of whom (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillMurray">Bill Murray</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDoyleMurray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BrianDoyleMurray">Brian Doyle-Murray</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherGuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherGuest">Christopher Guest</a>) went on to join the SNL cast.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> had an obvious influence on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> frequently acknowledged by people who worked on the series.

The show itself owes a lot to a tradition of host segments on old horror movies (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorHost">Horror Host</a>) dating back to the 1950s, and started in a similar vein—a local show on a station that needed filler. Its willingness to mock the movie not just during breaks but during the runtime, its reliance on sarcasm and wit rather than the stock campiness-and-bad-puns format of other hosts, and its heavy utilization of home video has insured that it outlasted and overshadowed most of its ancestors.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em>:
<ul><li> A lot of sketches are parodies of British TV shows that were popular during the late 1960s and early 1970s. For example, "How To Do It?" is a spoof of the BBC children's program <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BluePeter">Blue Peter</a></em>. "The Golden Age of Ballooning" spoofed costume dramas on the BBC. <em>Whicker's World</em> spoofed TV presenter Alan Whicker who had a travel show. The spinning globe was also an official BBC bumper between broadcasts. The sketch <em>The Bishop</em> is a parody of the opening titles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSaint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSaint">The Saint</a></em>. Many people who grew up outside the United Kingdom or who are younger than the 1970s will probably not understand something is being parodied.
</li><li> <em>Flying Circus</em> managed to do this to a <em>figure of speech</em>, of all things. The show's classic "Spanish Inquisition" sketch is kicked off when the Spanish Inquisition bursts into a boring British drawing room drama after a man gets tired of being badgered with questions, and cries out, "Mr. Wentworth just told me to come in here and say there was trouble at the mill, that's all! I didn't expect a kind of Spanish Inquisition!" Many younger viewers might be unaware that "I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition!" was a well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockJoke">Stock Joke</a> that had been used in English drama and television for decades before Monty Python came along; in classic absurdist fashion, the Pythons used that phrase as a stepping stone for a nonsensical sketch where the Spanish Inquisition takes it as their cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">to ambush a hapless Victorian couple in the Yorkshire countryside</a>. Of course, now that the Pythons' sketch is far better-known than the hackneyed old joke that it was mocking, it can be hard to get what made it so funny in the first place.

While the producers of <em>Hogan's Heroes</em> never acknowledged the parody, the two were similar enough to inspire a successful lawsuit by the creators of <em>Stalag 17</em>; even down to the name (and look) of the bumbling German guard "Sgt. Schulz". Today, <em>Hogan's Heroes</em> is an icon of American pop culture; while <em>Stalag 17</em> is known only to serious classic film and theatre buffs.

If you were to ask anybody trying to imitate this catchphrase who were born after 1980, they wouldn't even know who the real Rick James is, except some funny sketch from a comedy television show. Similarly, Kenan Thompson's series of "What Up With That" sketches on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>, which started airing in 2009, always include a parody of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FleetwoodMac">Lindsey Buckingham</a>, of all people.

Either that, or they saw the original TV and print ads for the IBM PS1 computer, which adopted Chaplin as an unofficial spokesperson (four years after his death!) in 1981.
</li><li> Many of the Sesame Street songs are spoofs of pop songs. Due to them either being too old or too adult for children to have heard the original, the Sesame Street parody is more likely to be recognized:
<ul><li> "That's the Letter O", comma a parody of "That's the Way We Flow" by Queen Latifah.
</li><li> "Don't Know Y", a parody of "Don't Know Why" by Norah Jones.

<p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> was originally a parody of vaudeville theater and variety TV shows. It also included <em>many</em> songs and acts from the vaudeville era, which would have otherwise been unknown to young viewers in the 70s. Today, even songs that were then contemporary are probably now only remembered by their <em>Muppet Show</em> appearances. The same is probably true for at least half the guest stars. The fact that viewers do not remember vaudeville is not entirely unexpected. It was a dominant form of theatrical entertainment from the 1880s to the 1930s, but was considered unable to compete with the then-innovative sound films at the movie theatres (or with the fact that tickets to a movie theatre were often much cheaper). During the 1930s, several companies and theatres previously counting on vaudeville for their profits, either shut down or invested in the film industry. Most of the old vaudeville stars were forced to either retire, or try their hands at a film career. References to vaudeville in the 1940s were already considered retro. About 70 years later, they are references to an entirely different era.

Popular enough, in fact, that Drew Carey's involvement in pitching Whose Line to the network was what got the show and its cast brought to the United States from England. These days, Whose Line still has a dedicated fanbase, and has had a successful revival in 2013. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDrewCareyShow">The Drew Carey Show</a></em> is not shown in reruns anymore, and while people probably remember when it was on, don't think of it much, except as "the other show Drew and Ryan were on while they were doing Whose Line."

Since 2002 the comic strip has been terminated and the albums are no longer available in regular stores, making the original reference more obscure.

</li><li> Engelke's parodies of politician Regine Hildebrandt were also prominent for a while. There is a rumor that Hildebrandt once entered a cab and the driver was completely surprised that she was actually real.
</li></ul></li><li> Partly a case with Greek sitcoms from the 1990s and 2000s, such as <em>Konstantinou kai Elenis</em> and <em>Savatogennimenes</em>.

One or two decades later, many of these sitcoms are still being broadcast on reruns and are familiar to most Greek television viewers. (The programs of old channels such as Mega Channel, have consisted primarily of reruns for years.) The dramatic series mentioned are rarely being broadcast anymore (with several of them considered too dated), and the soap operas are both long-defunct and never chosen for reruns by their channels. Quite a number of viewers have no idea what is being satirized.

A lot of casual viewers didn't recognize the song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BeMoreChill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/BeMoreChill">Be More Chill</a>.</em> Since <em>Be More Chill</em> was only given one nomination for Best Score (with the song's original singer, George Salazar, being snubbed for Featured Actor) and composer Joe Iconis wasn't even aware there would be such an extensive parody, several fans were upset that the song was parodied without giving a proper boost to the show, since it's not very well known outside of the theater fandom. Corden, as well as others in the theater community, later gave formal credit on social media, linking to videos of Salazar's original performance.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> There is a song from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGayNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGayNineties">The Gay '90s</a>, called "Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay", parts of which can be heard in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats">The Aristocats</a>. (It's the song Georges Hautecourt, the lawyer, sings when he visits Mme. Bonfamille.) However, viewers who grew up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> would be familiar with a different set of lyrics, to wit: "It's Howdy Doody time!".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a>:
<ul><li> If you say the word <em>beetle</em> in a non-English speaking country nobody will think of insects, but will immediately think you're referring to the rock group.
</li><li> The song "Good Morning, Good Morning" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SgtPeppersLonelyHeartsClubBand">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a></em> has a line about "it's time for tea and <em>Meet the Wife</em>." Most people probably assume it alludes to meeting your wife after a long day of work, but it's actually a reference to a popular British TV series, <em>Meet the Wife</em>, that has nowadays completely faded away in obscurity.
</li><li> English-speakers are probably more familiar with the beginning of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> "All You Need is Love" than the beginning of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/France">France</a>'s National Anthem.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EaglelandOsmosis">Probably doesn't apply to all English-speakers</a>. Those on the European side of the Pond are more likely to recognise La Marseillaise when they hear it.
</li><li> It's the tune that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">the man with the tape recorder up his nose</a> plays!
</li><li> And the tune to which Allan Sherman sings "Louis XVI was the king of France in 1789; he was worse than Louis XV... (etc.) ... the worst, since Louis the First!"
</li><li> This gets referenced in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Rifftrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/Rifftrax">Rifftrax</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Casablanca</a></em>. When part of Marseillaise is used in the opening (and closing) credits, the guys start singing "Love, love, love!"
</li></ul></li><li> Another Beatles song, "Back in the USSR", was originally written as a tribute to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ChuckBerry">Chuck Berry</a> song, <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/xGCJ5j7oVWc">"Back in the USA"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that is largely unremembered by comparison to the Beatles song. It was also a sarcastic response to a buy-native-made-goods ad campaign which used the slogan <a class="urllink" href="http://bit.ly/JRKZIW">"I'm Backing Britain"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (the refrain sounded like "I'm backin' the USSR") which no one remembers either.
</li><li> Again, it cuts both ways. The British answer to Weird Al is probably style parodist <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilInnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilInnes">Neil Innes</a>, whose Beatles-themed soundtrack to the parody film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRutles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRutles">All You Need Is Cash</a></em> was so stylistically perfect that to this day, songs like <em>I Must Be in Love</em> are often mistaken for actual Beatles tracks. Much of his earlier work with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand">The Bonzo Dog Band</a> consists of stylistically perfect parodies of other peoples' work; refer to the Bonzo Dog Band page for lots of examples.
<ul><li> And then to muddy things further, The Bonzo Dog Band showed up in a scene in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicalMysteryTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicalMysteryTour">Magical Mystery Tour</a></em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> For you American kids who sang "My Country, 'Tis of Thee (America)" in 2nd grade, you probably don't know that its melody is taken off "God Save the King/Queen".
<ul><li> Similarly, what US kids would call "The Graduation Song" (and is <em>actually</em> called "Pomp and Circumstance") contains the patriotic British anthem "Land of Hope and Glory" by Sir Edward Elgar.
</li><li> Britain's <em>God Save the King/Queen</em> is (allegedly) an adaptation of an earlier French anthem (<em>Grand Dieu sauve le Roi</em>) that was composed to commemorate Louis XIV's recovery from some painful hemorrhoids. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">Indeed</a>.
</li><li> AKA, even more esoterically, "We Wear Our Blue and White".
<ul><li> Or the theme for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaxmen</a>.
</li><li> Also a cover of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> guitar instrumental on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ANightAtTheOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ANightAtTheOpera">A Night at the Opera</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/EDUe6R-ogjM">The one they played on the PA at the end of their concerts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Molly and Emily from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGirlsCollection">American Girls Collection</a></em> fight over that very subject.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Merry Go 'Round Broke Down</em> is best known as "the theme song to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>".
<ul><li> Or that one song that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Roger Rabbit</a> plays when he breaks plates against his head.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></em> actually helps counteract the Weird Al Effect in this instance, as a few scenes later, Judge Doom says the name of the song in a very memorable scene. It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeFrameBonus">Freeze-Frame Bonus</a>, as pointed out by the DVD extras.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>, from <em>Billboard Frolics</em> of 1935, is only known today as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Merrie Melodies</a></em> tune and an incorrect alternative set of lyrics set to the tune of <em>Mary had a Little Lamb</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> has done this to other music. Thanks to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc">What's Opera, Doc?</a>" many people can't hear "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RideOfTheValkyries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RideOfTheValkyries">Ride of the Valkyries</a>" without singing "Kill da wabbit!" And the 19th-century song "Those Endearing Young Charms" is known today mainly for its use in a recurring <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XylophoneGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XylophoneGag">gag where a piano or xylophone explodes</a>—or at least it was until "Come On Eileen" came along.
<ul><li> Similar to the Roger Rabbit example above, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> had Slappy Squirrel use the proper name for the song, teaching at least some viewers its real name.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheechAndChong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CheechAndChong">Cheech and Chong</a>'s "Basketball Jones" is much better known than the song it was originally parodying: "Love Jones" by The Brighter Side of Darkness.
</li><li> The song "Flappie", by Dutch comedian Youp van 't Hek, was originally (in 1981) intended as a parody of Christmas songs, both contemporary and the older carols, and mostly of the fake 'Christmas spirit' people felt they needed to put up. Now most people don't realize that and play this song simply for the humorous lyrics (it tells the story of how a boy finds out his father killed his rabbit (called 'Flappie') to serve at the Christmas dinner). It's even a staple of the Christmas songs played on radio and in malls.
</li><li> "The Star-Spangled Banner", the national anthem of the United States, is a poem that was set to the tune of "The Anacreontic Song" (a.k.a. "To Anacreon in Heaven"). How many Americans have ever heard (or even heard of) the original drinking song, popularized by a society of amateur musicians to the point where it was often used as a <em>sobriety test</em> — its melody was so tortuous that if you could actually sing a stanza, you were sober enough for another round.
<ul><li> "The Anacreontic Song" was also supposed to be performed as a lively minuet. Such a performance of "The Star-Spangled Banner" today would be received as irreverent and un-American.
<ul><li> "The Star-Spangled Banner" <em>was</em> performed as a lively minuet until John Philip Sousa rearranged it circa 1900 to make it sound more majestic, and added, amongst other things, the two holds and the counterpoint. Most current arrangements are based on the Sousa version. The original, more spritely version can be heard in the Ken Burns documentary <em>The Civil War</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" ("Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord") took its melody (and some of its lyrics) from the Civil War marching song "John Brown's Body".
<ul><li> ...which took its melody from "Say, Brothers, Will You Meet Us".
</li><li> And which has subsequently found many new versions as summer camp songs such as "I wear my pink pajamas in the summer when it's hot..."
</li><li> "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the burning of the school..." AKA "Glory, Glory, Hallelujah/Teacher hit me with a ruler..."; every UGA fan has this stuck in their heads.
</li><li> Plus the Engineers drinking song, "Lady Godiva". Many Engineering students only know this song with the words: "We are, we are, we are, we are, we are the engineers. We can, we can, we can, we can demolish forty beers!".
</li></ul></li><li> National Lampoon's <em>Deteriorata</em> is obviously a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Desiderata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Desiderata">Desiderata</a></em>, but the style is a parody of a hit record recording of <em>Desiderata</em> by Les Crane in 1971, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">narmy</a> "You are a child of the universe" chorus.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllanSherman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AllanSherman">Allan Sherman</a>'s breakout hit <em>Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh!</em> is more well-known in the USA than its source, Amilcare Ponchielli's <em>Dance of the Hours</em>.
<ul><li> And nowadays the K9 Advantix commercial that uses a lyrically changed version of the song is probably more well-known to younger audiences.
</li><li> And if not either of these, there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fantasia">Fantasia</a></em>'s version accompanying the dancing ostriches and other animals.
</li><li> What was just mentioned above gets lampshaded in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> in which Peter, after visiting a 1950s-themed diner, becomes enamored with '50s and '60s novelty tunes. His absolute favorite is "Surfin' Bird" by The Trashmen, which he starts listening to <em>ad infinitum</em> and obsesses about to the point that the rest of the Griffin family becomes sick of the song. When Peter panics after Brian and Stewie steal the record, Lois comforts him with the fact that records don't just walk up and leave; this leads to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutawayGag">Cutaway Gag</a> with an old LP of Sherman's "Camp Granada" song, stomping out the door in a huff while claiming (in a stereotypical upstate New York accent) that there are many "old Jews out there" who still want to listen to it.
<ul><li> "Surfin' Bird", incidentally, is combination of "Papa-Oom-Mow-Mow" and "The Bird's the Word" by The Rivingtons, and is now better known than either of them. And indeed, the song is much better known today from its use on <em>Family Guy</em> than as a hit from the '60s.
</li><li> And there may be one or two in the audience who remembered when the short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS</a> cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Birdz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Birdz">Birdz</a></em> used a cover of "Surfin' Bird" as its theme song.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "On top of Spa-ghehhhhhh-tiiiiiii, all covered with cheeeeeeeeeeeeese..." For all non-yanks in the Audience <em>On Top of Old Smokey</em> is an American Folk Song. And for all those Americans in the audience too young to remember any but the least obscure folk songs, the third line is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong">lost my true lover</a>", not "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">shot my poor teacher</a>".
<ul><li> Another rendition of this for military children in Japan is "On top of Mt Fuji, all covered with sand, I shot my poor teacher, with a rubber band."
</li><li> 'On Top of Spaghetti' is a real song. Copyrighted and everything.
</li></ul></li><li> The melody to the children's song "Head and Shoulders, Knees and Toes" is taken from the verses of the song "There Is a Tavern in the Town", a late 19th century drinking song. It has also been set to "London Bridge Is Falling Down", but unlike "There Is a Tavern in the Town", that song is still fairly well-known in its own right.
</li><li> French satirist group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LesInconnus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LesInconnus">Les Inconnus</a> has quite a few such songs. C'est toi que je t'aime is still played at almost every student party (at least in Belgium), more than 20 years after its release, while very few people remember ska band <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManoNegra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManoNegra">Mano Negra</a> on whose performances the parody is based (although most people know who is <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManuChao" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ManuChao">Manu Chao</a>, very few know that this is the band which made him famous before his solo albums). The same could be said about Casser les couilles which parodizes Patrick Bruel's Casser la voix.
<ul><li> While "Casser la voix" and Bruel himself are still somewhat recognized in France (albeit among the sort of people who still remember him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">teen heartthrob</a> rather than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">poker commentator</a>), this completely applies to "Isabelle a les yeux bleus", which took large jabs at the band Indochine, its needlessly depressed tone, its word salad lyrics, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a>, and is possibly the most well-known of Les Inconnus' parodies in France today. Suffice to say Indochine frontman Nicolas Sirkis was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">not amused</a>. And today, virtually any mention of Princess Stephanie Grimaldi will elicit a reference to their impression of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">STEPHANIIIE DE MONACOOOO</a>. Or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Est-fe que tu baives</a>".
</li></ul></li><li> On the subject of French satirists, the song "La Carioca" from Les Nuls' film "La Cité de la peur". It's often believed to be a real dance (since Carioca literally means an inhabitant of Rio), but Alain Chabat made it up on the spot, ostensibly to poke fun at shoehorned musical interludes in period <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">Red Scare</a> films.
</li><li> Gracie Fields' "Sing As We Go" from the 1930's is almost completely forgotten today, save for the melody—instantly recognizable as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a>'s "Sit On My Face", written by Eric Idle, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/MontyPythonsContractualObligationAlbum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/MontyPythonsContractualObligationAlbum">Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album</a></em>.

<ul><li> While it probably won't eclipse the Muppets, the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/iEWgs6YQR9A">ROFLMAO Song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/OxhornShortShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/OxhornShortShorts">Oxhorn</a> is fairly well known.

</li><li> Also, younger Muppet viewers might have originally thought the "word" was <em>phenomenon</em> and that the song came from Kermit and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/h5Mc55P1i9g">Sandra Bullock<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the UK at least, novelty group The Wurzels' song about their brand new combine harvester is better-known than the original, "Brand New Key" by Melanie.
<ul><li> If they see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BoogieNights">Boogie Nights</a></em>, they'll never forget the original.
</li><li> The Wurzels didn't even come up with Combine Harvester on their own either.

<ul><li> And in turn, many were co-opted as union songs, the best-known of which are "The Preacher and the Slave" ("The Sweet By and By") and "Which Side Are You On?" ("Lay the Lily Low").
</li><li> Thank you, Martin Luther; all those months spent, ahem, <em>researching</em> folk songs in German taverns have left behind some great pieces of music.

</li><li> The classic Shaker hymn <em>Simple Gifts</em> has been appropriated twice: Once for another hymn (<em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LordOfTheDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LordOfTheDance">Lord Of The Dance</a></em>), but most people would recognize it as the first movement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AaronCopland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AaronCopland">Aaron Copland</a>'s ballet/suite <em>Appalachian Spring</em>. The tune is attributed: that section is titled <em>Variations on a Shaker Melody</em>.

</li><li> John Philip Sousa's march "The Liberty Bell" is now better known as the theme for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus">Monty Python's Flying Circus</a></em>.
<ul><li> Hearing this theme played straight at the inauguration of U.S. presidents is something that amuses British people — and Python-literate Americans — immensely. A possible urban myth has it that the British diplomatic contingent at the inauguration of President Clinton all, without fail, blew a squelching-raspberry noise at the end of the sixteenth bar. Some things become <em>ingrained</em>...
</li><li> The other Sousa march trotted out at such an occasion is the Earwig Song, one generations of British people know, from football matches, as a soccer chant:
<div class="indent"> <em>Earwig-o, earwig-o, earwig-o... (Here we go, here we go, here we go!)</em>
</div><ul><li> It's known to Americans as "The Stars and Stripes Forever", though its bridge may be better known thus:

<ul><li> For those in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">'80s</a> who were unfamiliar with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Excalibur">Excalibur</a></em>, it was "the music from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConanTheBarbarian1982">Conan the Barbarian (1982)</a></em>" — or "that Old Spice music" (from an aftershave commercial). (It's not in <em>Conan</em> the movie, but it is in a trailer for <em>Conan</em>.)

</li><li> It's also almost unknown, to all but the most hardcore orchestral music buffs, that the words of Carl Orff's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CarminaBurana">Carmina Burana</a></em> are taken from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">much older collection</a> of Latin and German songs and poems by the same name (many of them quite bawdy for their time).
</li><li> "Estuans interius ira vehementi". Odds are you're not thinking of one of the poems, or even the Orff rendition, as much as you're thinking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>. The same goes for the rest of the non-Sephiroth lyrics of that song. (In fact, "sors, immanis et inanis" comes from "O Fortuna" itself.)
</li></ul></li><li> Many will recognise <em>Entry of the Gladiators</em> as the Ringling Brothers/Barnum and Bailey circus music.

</li><li> There was once a Russian musical piece called "Days of our life". They had to stop playing it because whenever they did, <em>everyone was laughing at remembering the parody</em>.

<ul><li> "I'm sure you recognize this lovely melody as 'Stranger in Paradise.' But did you know that the original theme is from the Polovetsian Dance No. 2 by Borodin? So many of the tunes of our well-known popular songs were actually written by the great masters—like these familiar themes... "
</li></ul></li><li> "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" was written about soldiers during the American Civil War, but most today know it as the playground song "The Ants Go Marching One By One." The Civil War song was a version of the much more depressing Irish song "Johnny we hardly Knew Ye" about a soldier returning from war missing his limbs. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteeleyeSpan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SteeleyeSpan">Steeleye Span</a> did a version called "Fighting for Strangers".)

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The tune we now hear as "Hail, hail the Gang's all here" comes from "With Catlike tread" in Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Pirates of Penzance", which was a pretty obvious homage of "The Anvil Chorus" or "Gypsy Chorus" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiuseppeVerdi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GiuseppeVerdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>'s "Il Trovatore".

</li><li> "Aquarela do Brasil" ("Watercolor of Brazil") dates back to 1939, and gained initial success in the States via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SaludosAmigos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SaludosAmigos">Saludos Amigos</a></em>.

The younger set will probably only remember it from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE">Wall E</a></em> trailer.

</li><li> Doubly-subverted with Weird Al's "Amish Paradise": Most people know that it's a parody of Coolio's song "Gangsta's Paradise" (1995); fewer will remember that the latter was recorded for the 1995 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichellePfeiffer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichellePfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DangerousMinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DangerousMinds">Dangerous Minds</a></em>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">never reached the same level of popularity as its soundtrack</a>. However, what most people don't know is that Gangsta's Paradise <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SampledUp">samples the chorus and music of the song "Pastime Paradise"</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsInTheKeyOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsInTheKeyOfLife">Songs in the Key of Life</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder">Stevie Wonder</a> (1976).
</li><li> Thanks to being featured in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Blade">Blade</a></em>, and in turn being sampled by Public Domain and Warp Brothers, the Pump Panel acid techno remix of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NewOrder">New Order</a>'s "Confusion" ended up displacing the original.

</li><li> Bollywood music director Anu Malik, infamous for plagiarism, has ended up doing this to a few songs. British Indian rapper Apache Indian's <em>Chok There</em> was a minor hit in India despite heavy airplay, but Anu Malik's parody <em>Stop That</em>, sung by Devang Patel (an Indian counterpart of Weird Al), was a runaway hit for a long time in India. A few years later, <em>Neend Churayi</em>, directed by him, was a hit and went high up the Bollywood charts, while the song it ripped off, <em>Sending All My Love</em> by Linear, still remained obscure, and is remembered faintly only because Anu Malik copied it.
<ul><li> Another Bollywood music director almost did the same with <em>Pal Pal Har Pal</em> from <em>Lage Raho Munnabhai</em>, which was a big hit with the masses, but there were far too many fans of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CliffRichard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CliffRichard">Cliff Richard</a> in India, who were familiar with <em>Theme For A Dream</em>, for this to go unnoticed.
</li></ul></li><li> Many a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> fan probably have never seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGoodTheBadAndTheUgly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></em> aside from <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/tI0TAk1e-VI">the clip that plays before the band takes the stage<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (they have also covered said track, "The Ecstasy of Gold"). A minor case is "The Frayed Ends of Sanity" <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/rjBrkfX_XHw">borrowing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/224gm8JEVx0">from<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">The Wizard of Oz</a></em>.
</li><li> UFO is a band that still plays to date, but isn't that well remembered outside of rock/metal fans. And some only know them because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/IronMaiden">Iron Maiden</a> has "Doctor Doctor" on the PA before they start playing.
</li><li> The Edvard Grieg composition "In the Hall of the Mountain King" is better known for its usage in the theme song to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>.
<ul><li> It isn't exactly the same tune, but it was inspired by it. British viewers will know this song as the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/AltonTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Ride/AltonTowers">Alton Towers</a> theme", after a theme park there used the song for its ads.
</li></ul></li><li> "Like a Boss" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLonelyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLonelyIsland">The Lonely Island</a> is much better known than Slim Thug's rap song of the same name, which it parodies.
</li><li> Video game remix and mashup conglomerate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiIvaGunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SiIvaGunner">SiIvaGunner</a> has become this to many video game music fans. By taking advantage of YouTube's sans-serif font that causes capital "i" to look like lowercase "L", they successfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Trolled</a> many video game music fans trying to look for the real GilvaSunner's music uploads. Eventually, SiIva's pranks gained a fandom of their own, and now a lot of people tend to associate the real GilvaSunner's videos with SiIva's "high quality video game rips."
<ul><li> The effect was made even stronger when Siiva's 'rips' started to become just as popular, and in several cases more popular, than actual videos of the music on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. Famously, google searching "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Slider - Super Mario 64</a>" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LoveLive">Snow Halation - Love Live</a>" will result in Siiva being the top hit.
</li></ul></li><li> This can happen to a Bowdlerization as well as a parody: more people heard the slightly syrupy "Bless 'em All" (especially in its <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/xf4jhb9p2v8">rendition by Vera Lynn<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) than Fred Godfrey's original WWI song, whose first word wasn't "Bless."
<ul><li> For that matter, generations later than WWII are likely to recognize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VeraLynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VeraLynn">Vera Lynn's</a> name only from references to her in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd">Pink Floyd's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWall">The Wall</a>, and associate her most famous song with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DrStrangelove">nuclear annihilation</a> rather than going off to war.
</li></ul></li><li> Most Theory of a Deadman fans don't realize that "Bitch Came Back" is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">In the Style of...</a> a children's song called "The Cat Came Back".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a>'s "Lobachevsky" is much better known than its direct inspiration, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyKaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyKaye">Danny Kaye</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatterSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatterSong">Patter Song</a> titled "Stanislavsky."
</li><li> The bouncy jazz-blues standard "Why Don't You Do Right" was singlehandedly transformed into a slow, sultry number by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Jessica Rabbit</a>. Nowadays, the original style of singing it is nowhere to be found in covers of the song.
</li><li> If one goes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> views, the song "God Is A Girl" is this. Some people heard the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/TiVIFMbwxOc">Nightcore version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by Maikel-6311 first (also like it better) than the <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/rp53irFjzYg">original version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by band "Groove Coverage".
</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/PewDiePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/PewDiePie">PewDiePie</a></em> was playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DokiDokiLiteratureClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DokiDokiLiteratureClub">Doki Doki Literature Club!</a></em>, he makes a reference to a Swedish song called "Hej Hej Monika" and sings it (due to a character in-game named Monika who is very iconic in the game). Then he made a cover of the song with the help of <em>Party In The Background</em> and let's just say many people would know <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk8UEWHYfEg">his version of the song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> better than the <em>2004</em> version.
</li><li> It is impossible for gay men to listen to "Girl on Fire" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AliciaKeys">Alicia Keys</a> without hearing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragQueen">Drag Queen</a> parody "This Boy is a Bottom" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillamBelli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WillamBelli">Willam Belli</a>.
</li><li> The song from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, "Tequila", is recognizable to any child of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> as "the Pee-Wee Herman dance". Some of them will also recognize it as the "Ninjutsu" dance from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>.
</li><li> "What's Going On" by 4 Non Blondes was a major touchstone for Generation X. Younger generations will probably lack the same visceral, angsty response to the song, instead being surprised that it doesn't have a red-hot gaybar dance beat, and isn't sung in increasingly silly falsetto voices by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man</a>.

"Sweet Home Alabama" is much more famous and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsntItIronic">has lost its meaning</a> due to being used in so many irrelevant contexts.
</li><li> Those born after the 2000s would probably associate "I'm A Believer" with the cover sung by Donkey in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DancePartyEnding">Dance Party Ending</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a> (performed on the soundtrack by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SmashMouth">Smash Mouth</a>) long before they would attribute it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMonkees">The Monkees</a>, who first made the song famous, and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NeilDiamond">Neil Diamond</a>, the original performer.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> has been so ingrained in Western culture that many sentences, expressions, sayings, allusions, festivities in many languages are directly inspired by the text, yet how many people are aware of all of them? Even Christians may not realize all the linguistic expressions that have a biblical origin.
<ul><li> Many, many common names in regions where the Abrahamic traditions are dominant come from the Abrahamic tradition. The names have, through use, become utterly unremarkable. What English speaker immediately thinks of the Biblical origin of such common names Thomas, Matthew, David, Mark, John, Michael, Sarah, Elizabeth, Rachel, Naomi, and Mary? The same happens in many languages. More at <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_biblical_names">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, some stuff that is associated with Christianity has in fact little to do with it. Christmas, for instance. People already held end-of-the-year festivities centuries before Christ's birth and the Church simply adapted Jesus' birth to that date because these pagan festivities, like Saturnalia (Roman Winter Solistice) were too popular to simply ignore or suppress. Even if you approach the text logically it wouldn't make sense for shepherds to be tending sheep flocks at night during the winter (but they would in spring). Though the date of Christmas is nine months after the Conception on March 25 — the start of the barley harvest in the Middle East— the Bible still doesn't mention the date of Jesus' conception and birth.
<ul><li> His birth date comes from the Jewish tradition of being executed on the date of your conception.
</li></ul></li><li> In Belgium and the Netherlands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sinterklaas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sinterklaas">Sinterklaas</a> is a popular festivity. Many foreigners assume he is a rip-off of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a>, while in reality it's the other way around! Also, <em>Sinterklaas</em> was originally a Catholic saint <em>Saint Nicholas</em>, but since the 19th century people of all faith celebrate Sinterklaas, many not even aware of its religious origin. In fact: the only thing still reminding of his Catholicness are his name and outfit. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">And to go even further</a>: Sinterklaas riding his white horse and leaving presents for the children on December 5th was derived from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Scandinavian god Odin and his white horse Sleipnir</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> Many Flemish and Dutch folklore characters are more familiar to Flemish people for appearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuskeEnWiske">Suske en Wiske</a></em> albums than from their original origin.

</li><li> American folklore and/or tall tale characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/PaulBunyan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/PaulBunyan">Paul Bunyan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnnyAppleseed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnnyAppleseed">Johnny Appleseed</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavyCrockett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DavyCrockett">Davy Crockett</a>, Pecos Bill... are all more familiar to audiences today from the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> used them in cartoons and/or live-action TV series.
<ul><li> Paul Bunyan is an especially interesting example. The character originated in loggers' folktales, but his national popularity and best-known stories come from a promotional pamphlet for the Red River Lumber Company. So when Disney re-introduced him, it was the <em>second</em> time that an older Paul had been covered up by a newer version.

Even where those based on songs that are still widely known (Adelaide: the "Marines' Hymn" (as in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">US Marines</a>); Brisbane: "La Marseillaise"; Geelong: Song of the Toreador from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen">Carmen</a></em>; Hawthorn: "Yankee Doodle Dandy"; St Kilda: "When the Saints Go Marching In"), people are more likely to be familiar with the club song lyrics, while once-popular songs used by other clubs (Carlton: "Lily of Laguna"; Collingwood: "Goodbye Dolly Gray"; Essendon: "Keep Your Sunny Side Up"; Melbourne: "Grand Old Flag" (which is very well-known in America); North Melbourne: "Wee Doch an Dorus"; Richmond: "Row, Row, Row" (not to be confused with "Row, Row, Row Your Boat"); Sydney: "Victory March" (the University of Notre Dame fight song); Western Bulldogs: "Sons of the Sea") are now known almost exclusively as the club songs. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/iSANBgZzi6o">Here are some of the original versions.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

<div class="indent"><strong>Brian:</strong> Should I make them listen to the original song first, and then go "Okay, here's Weird Al's version of it"?

<ul><li> Hardly anyone realises that the willow song in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMikado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMikado">The Mikado</a></em> was actually a parody of the song Desdemona sings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em>.
<ul><li> Which itself was a well-known tune at the time, a fact that is lampshaded in the play when Desdemona accidentally starts singing the wrong verse and catches herself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Ruddigore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Ruddigore">Ruddigore</a></em> is mostly a parody of a kind of melodrama no one watches anymore.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em> was written as a parody of action plays popular around Shakespeare's time, in particular the most popular play in the Elizabethan era, a simple revenge plot about the Danish prince written by Thomas Kyd. While <em>Hamlet</em> has become one of Shakespeare's most popular plays and the main role a key challenge for actors, the Kyd play has been lost. Scholars call it "Ur-Hamlet."
<ul><li> Also, Amleth.
</li><li> In Shakespeare's day it was very common for writers to rewrite well known stories, telling the same tales over and over with variation. Novelty wasn't exactly prized in art. As a result, many of Shakespeare's plays are based on other stories and/or plays. For example the tale of Hamlet derives from a legendary character in <em>Gesta Danorum</em> (13th century) by Saxo Grammaticus, King Lear is a character from the <em>Historia Regum Britanniae</em> (12th century) by Geoffrey of Monmouth, and Romeo and Juliet are characters from the 1550s novellas of Matteo Bandello.
</li></ul></li><li> The famous quote from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwelfthNight">Twelfth Night</a></em>, "some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon 'em" is a parody of Matthew 19:12: "For there are some eunuchs, which were so borne of their mothers belly: and there be some eunuchs, which be gelded by men: and there be some eunuchs, which have gelded themselves for the kingdom of Heaven." (From the Geneva Bible, a modernized version of the translation Shakespeare would be most likely to have read, omitting the annotations telling to take it metaphorically.) Between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> of this verse and Shakespeare's importance, the first quote has become <em>far</em> more familiar than the second.
<ul><li> And many people associate it with Joseph Heller's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CatchTwentyTwo">Catch-22</a></em> (his version substituting "mediocre" and "mediocrity" for "great" and "greatness" respectively) rather than Shakespeare.
</li></ul></li><li> A few Shakespeare scholars suspect that this effect accounts for a lot of puzzling things the Bard wrote. Several parts of his early comedies and later romances (the ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwoGentlemenOfVerona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwoGentlemenOfVerona">Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></em>, Posthumus' notorious vision in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cymbeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Cymbeline">Cymbeline</a></em>, most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TitusAndronicus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TitusAndronicus">Titus Andronicus</a></em>, etc.) are not just generally deemed bad ... they're bad in bizarre, far-out-in-left-field ways that have left centuries of readers stumped as to what Shakespeare even thought he was doing. However, these scholars argue, many of these plays fall into focus if we picture Shakespeare writing them as merciless parodies of other popular Elizabethan plays, which are now lost to history.
</li><li> It cuts both ways. Many people have searched the Bible in vain for the line <em>"The devil can cite Scripture for his own purpose. An evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek."</em> not realising the provenance is Shakespeare: <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>, Act One, Scene Three. Shakespeare is referencing something that actually happens in the Bible, at least (the Temptation in the Desert, which appears in three Gospels).
</li><li> "Whatever Lola Wants" has been used in so many commercials like this one for Levis Jeans: (NSFW) <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/hPaYk2dnDhM">[1]<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that many people don't know that it was used in the musical <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DamnYankees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DamnYankees">Damn Yankees</a></em>.
</li><li> Everyone remembers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHoudini">Harry Houdini</a>, but the man whose name he stole as his pseudonym, magician Jean-Baptiste Houdin, is nowadays very obscure.
</li><li> Indeed, the parody sometimes outlives the original, as many of the plays by famous Greek tragedians which were made a mockery of in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a>'s plays are now lost.
<ul><li> Aristophanes was also parodying and making satirical references to comedy works by his rivals, such as Eupolis and Cratinus. He is the only writer of Old Comedy whose works survive to the present day, and we know little about his contemporaries.
</li><li> Some of the politicians and generals satirized by Aristophanes suffered the same fate. Lamachus was a real-life general of the Peloponnesian War, and was killed in combat (along with most of his unit) in 415 BCE. But he is mostly remembered because he is the antagonist in <em>The Acharnians</em>, one of the most famous among Aristophanes' surviving works. Cleonymus of Athens was a real-life general and politician, who reportedly threw away his shield during a battle and run for his life. Aristophanes often mocked him for his cowardice. More that 2000 years later, most people (including scholars) know Cleonymus due to Aristophanes' jokes about him, rather than anything he did in life.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of scenes in works by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Euripides">Euripides</a> seem to satirize or point at plot holes in the older works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aeschylus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>. Modern readers often have to read annotations to get the references.

Because <em>Smash Bros.</em> is a much more mainstream game than <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> (which notoriously had a very limited print run in the Americas and came out extremely late in the Wii's life cycle, while <em>Smash 4</em> has collectively sold nearly 10 million units), Shulk's version of the line has become much more well-known among the general gaming audience.

The fact that it's about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Fluttershy</a> is most likely a huge contributing factor to this.

Nowadays, the former fic is so famous and well-known that the latter was actually called a rip-off of Weiss Reacts, even though <em>it came first</em>.

Complicating things is the fact that "Children" uses original lyrics not featured in the original movie that were added years after <em>Hocus Pocus</em>' release in a fanmade cover of the song.

The Plinkett reviews have proven so explosively popular that Stoklasa's version of the character has far eclipsed Evans's, to the point that Evans's reprising of the role for <em>Half in the Bag</em> was mostly met with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">They Changed It, Now It Sucks!</a> - even RLM has come to call Evans's version <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouDontLookLikeYou">"Fake Plinkett."</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Twitter">Twitter</a> parody account <em>@seinfeldToday</em> got very popular in 2014-2015 sharing imaginary Seinfeld plots based around modern technology, and was widely criticsed for being lame and uninspired (including by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDavid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryDavid">Larry David</a>). One of its critics started a parody account of the parody account, <em>@seinfeld2000</em>, which contained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">dreadful spelling and grammar</a>, surreal and horrifying plotlines, and very well-produced parody <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mashup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mashup">Mashup</a> videos and music. <em>@seinfeld2000</em> has outlived <em>@seinfeldToday</em> and made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">a popular meme</a>.
</li><li> These days, it's nearly impossible to find references to the original 4 Non Blondes song "What's Up?". It has been almost entirely supplanted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse">He-Man</a> parody remix, "HEHEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA" (part of a larger parody, "<a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/FR7wOGyAzpw">Fabulous Secret Powers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, by Slackcircus created in 2005).

At least one teen recognized it as "The song Weird Al parodied". He couldn't actually name the song beyond that.
</li><li> In a case of a work doing this to itself, memetic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a></em> song "Trogdor" features the line "And the Trogdor comes in the NIIIIIGHT!", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail">Strong Bad Email</a> "guitar", where Strong Bad improvised a song that included the line "And the dragon comes in the NIIIIIGHT!" As "guitar" is a fairly early email that's on the obscure side, and the Trogdor theme is popular even outside the site, chances are very likely anyone who heard the original heard the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call-Back</a> first.
</li><li> There are quite a few people who have never heard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DrDre">Dr. Dre</a>'s "What's the Difference" before hearing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillCosby">Bill Cosby</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a> rap using that song's background music and audio samples of Cosby from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>.
</li><li> Those who saw the viral video "She Blocked Me" from Albino Blacksheep may be hard-pressed to find that it's a parody of the lesser-known song "She Hates Me" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuddleOfMudd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PuddleOfMudd">Puddle of Mudd</a>.
</li><li> In 1953, German playwright Max Frisch published <em>Biedermann und die Brandstifter</em> (or <em>The Arsonists</em> in English), a stage play about a pair of psychotic arsonists who pose as simple traveling salesmen, and use their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">charm and wit</a> to persuade a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">perfectly ordinary man</a> to help them in their arson spree; written when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s rise to power was still in recent memory, Frisch intended the fire as a metaphor for fascism, and used the play to demonstrate how otherwise good people can be taken in by evil.

This scene was so famous at the time that most people immediately got the connection.
</div></li><li> People are also more familiar with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgersInTheTwentyFourthAndAHalfCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgersInTheTwentyFourthAndAHalfCentury">Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century</a></em> than with its parody target <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuckRogersInTheTwentyFifthCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuckRogersInTheTwentyFifthCentury">Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24ci61');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24ci61" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24ci61');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although many will remember the later 1979 TV series</span>.
</li><li> Daffy is also responsible for <em>permanently changing the pronunciation of an English word.</em> The word "despicable" is actually supposed to be pronounced <a class="urllink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7iocw3kK9BIC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;lpg=PA109&amp;dq=despicable+pronunciation+Daffy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3SUHKU-6Cj&amp;sig=PFHsSpuNC0ss1vx4J44kSlvRIZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=jckuTeTpGMaAlAfP2uzmCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage">with the accent on the first syllable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: "DES-picable". Mispronouncing it was part of Daffy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">Malaproper</a> schtick. However, since the cartoons reached so many kids who were too young to have the <em>real</em> pronunciation in their vocabularies yet, Daffy's "You're de-SPICK-able" was the pronunciation they all learned. And it holds true still today: That Steve Carrell movie isn't called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DespicableMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DespicableMe">DES-picable Me</a></em>. On the other hand, few people nowadays say "FORM-idable" or "LAM-entable" either, and that can hardly be blamed on Daffy.
</li><li> Conversely, Bugs Bunny is likely responsible for the term "Nimrod" as an insult. He says it to Elmer Fudd sarcastically, as Nimrod was <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod">a great hunter in the Bible<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. (Apparently, moviegoers in the 1940s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGeniuses">had an encyclopedic knowledge of the Old Testament</a>.) It is likely that anyone using the term today will be using it to say that the target of the word is foolish or stupid.
<ul><li> In fact, it's gotten to the point that most people who now study the Bible will assume that the name Nimrod is a case of unintentional irony.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBlanc">Mel Blanc</a>'s impression of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre">Peter Lorre</a> in particular really took on a life of its own. The real Lorre's voice wasn't nearly as raspy as Blanc's imitation, but that imitation has inspired so many others that people raised on them might not even recognize Lorre in any of his films.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDoverBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDoverBoys">The Dover Boys</a></em> is well known as the cartoon where Chuck Jones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">found his voice</a> with stylized off-the-wall slapstick. Hardly anyone remembers the <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRoverBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRoverBoys">The Rover Boys</a></em> books it spoofed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepeLePew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepeLePew">Pepé Le Pew</a> is based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBoyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlesBoyer">Charles Boyer</a>'s character Pépé le Moko (from the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Algiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Algiers">Algiers</a></em>), with a little bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MauriceChevalier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MauriceChevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a> thrown in. Even if you've heard of these sources, they are less familiar than the amorous skunk is.
<ul><li> Not quite. He is actually a parody of a (then) well known French actor named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanGabin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeanGabin">Jean Gabin</a> who stared in "Pépé le Moko" which was re-made in English as "Algiers", making this a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotShazam">I Am Not Shazam</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most younger viewers watching that really thin character type, with blue, blue eyes, and a velvet voice singing and making the females faint, might not know that it is a parody of a young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankSinatra">"Franky" Sinatra</a>. Yeah, Ol' Blue Eyes himself.
<ul><li> Even fewer would recognize him as the "Singing Sword" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a>?</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> episode where Lorelai wonders out loud about whether anvils were so ubiquitous that they would have been so easily recognized by children watching the cartoons.
</li><li> While Steinbeck's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OfMiceAndMen">Of Mice &amp; Men</a></em> is not exactly obscure, it probably says something that the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge">And Call Him "George"!</a> is named after a cartoon parody of it. The trope's association with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> cartoon characters is so much a part of comedy now that most students reading <em>Of Mice And Men</em> in modern times are absolutely unable to take it seriously, despite it being quite a tragic story.
</li><li> Background characters often got one-liners or mannerisms that were taken from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/FibberMcGeeAndMolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/FibberMcGeeAndMolly">Fibber McGee and Molly</a></em> radio show, including "That ain't the way I heard it!", "Oh, is that you, Myrt? How's every little thing?", "I bet-cha", and "Tain't funny, McGee!". One of the show's regular cast members, Arthur Q. Bryan, supplied the voice for Elmer Fudd, making him one of the three male voice actors, along with Mel Blanc and Stan Freberg, to regularly appear in the classic <em>Looney Tunes</em> shorts.
<ul><li> The title character from the <em>Fibber</em> spinoff show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGreatGildersleeve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGreatGildersleeve">The Great Gildersleeve</a></em> was also parodied several times — Bugs even did a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> for one, saying that he sounded like "that guy on the radio, The Great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodyName">Gildersneeze</a>". Many shorts also borrowed the catchphrase of <em>Gildersleeve</em> supporting character Mr. Peavey: "Well, now, I wouldn't say that!"
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner">Road Runner</a> was originally intended as a parody of all the chase scenes that were frequent in many cartoons from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation">The Golden Age of Animation</a>. Now it is almost the only famous example of "chase cartoon". To be fair, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">at least one</a> of the cartoons that they parodied is still very well known.
<ul><li> More to the point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a> intended the blackout gags in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadRunner">Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner</a> sub-series to be a reference to the then-popular "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFoxAndTheCrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFoxAndTheCrow">The Fox and the Crow</a></em>" (1941-1950) series of theatrical cartoons, created by Frank Tashlin for the Screen Gems studio. The series he was imitating/parodying ended in 1950, just a year after Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner debuted. Guess which comedy duo, modern audiences are most familiar with.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of tunes that were popular at the time but completely forgotten about later, made appearances in Warner Brothers cartoons. For example, few members of the modern audience would recognize the name of the song "We're in the Money" from the movie <em>Gold Diggers of 1933</em>. But let them <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/UJOjTNuuEVw">listen to the song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and they will immediately recognize the melody that played whenever some character in the Warner Brothers cartoons experienced an unexpected windfall.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ILoveToSinga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ILoveToSinga">I Love to Singa</a></em> was a parody of the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJazzSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheJazzSinger">The Jazz Singer</a></em>. The short lives on in popularity while the film is mostly remembered for two things: 1. The fact it was the first full-length "talkie" (though technically most of the film was a silent film) and 2. The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blackface">Blackface</a> scene. And despite the short being more popular than the film, even it probably wouldn't be recognized today without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">Cartman getting an anal probe</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> themselves (and their sibling Warner cartoons, "Merrie Melodies") were originally named such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelingWorks">parody/response</a> to Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SillySymphonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SillySymphonies">Silly Symphonies</a></em>.

But if you dig further, you'll note their unmistakable resemblance to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWuzzles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWuzzles">The Wuzzles</a></em>, a slightly obscure 1980's kids' show also produced by Disney. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWuzzles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheWuzzles">The Wuzzles</a></em> was also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">Merchandise-Driven</a>; when that show was current, store shelves did have boxes with stuffed Wuzzles on/in them. Disney remembers that aspect... But probably nobody else does. <em>The Wuzzles</em> was a 13-episode series, originally broadcast over a 3-months period in 1985. It is one of Disney's shortest-lived series.
</li><li> Grandpa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> has a photo stashed away of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HedyLamarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HedyLamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a>. Naturally, kids had to go ask their parents.
</li><li> The "Log" song from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> is a parody of <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/XdjNH34a2l4">classic Slinky commercials<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. There's also comedian Stinky Wizzleteats from "Stimpy's Invention," a spoof of actor/musician <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BurlIves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BurlIves">Burl Ives</a>. Specifically the lines about "teaching your grandmother to suck eggs" and "I told you I'd shoot but you didn't believe me!" come from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBigCountry">The Big Country</a></em>. And, of course, Ren's voice and persona are largely based on characters played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterLorre">Peter Lorre</a>, with Ren's famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> "You fat, bloated <em>EEDIOT!</em>" paraphrased from Joel Cairo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMalteseFalcon1941" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMalteseFalcon1941">The Maltese Falcon</a></em>. <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/IvVuNkE-LMw">See here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The classic schtick of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyPolitePals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyPolitePals">two characters trying to out-polite each other</a> "After you. No I insist after you." has been done innumerable times in <em>Goofy Gophers</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeckleAndJeckle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeckleAndJeckle">Heckle and Jeckle</a></em> cartoons. Both of these are parodies of a much older comic strip routine involving two guys named Alphonse and Gaston. The only way a non-historian would have heard those names would be at a baseball game. (An "Alphonse and Gaston" is when two guys chase a fly ball and simultaneously pull up so it drops between them.) And then you need an announcer who loves the classics. - Though the original Alphonse and Gaston comic strip was actually fairly long-running (1901-1937), and had received adaptations in stage plays and films. It was one of the most famous creations of comic strip artist Frederick Burr Opper (18571937), one of the pioneers of the comic strip genre. Opper's best remembered character is Happy Hooligan (1900-1932), the "well-meaning hobo who encountered a lot of misfortune and bad luck" due to unjust treatment. He was the character which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> was imitating in his "Little Tramp" persona.
<ul><li> On "It's That Man Again", a wartime BBC radio show, it was "After you Claude." "After YOU, Cecil."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's just easier to say that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> is another Weird Al Effect machine a la <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, particularly when it comes to '80s cartoons and toys:
</li><li> "Oh my god! Somebody remembered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepawayCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepawayCamp">this movie</a> and made a comedy sketch about it!"
</li><li> Most younger fans may not be aware that the chickens bawking in the end is "The Gonk" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978">Dawn of the Dead (1978)</a></em> and instead refer to it as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTune">Theme Tune</a>.
</li><li> Composite Santa Claus is probably more well-known than the villain he's a parody of. Composite Superman hasn't been seen since before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em>, and the few people who remember him probably wish they didn't.
<ul><li> Ironically, Composite Superman wound up appearing in <em>Robot Chicken DC Comics Special III: Magical Friendship</em>, with a major role, no less!
</li></ul></li><li> One sketch had Lewis and Clark, portrayed by Lois Lane and Clark Kent, specifically acting out their unique character traits from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LoisAndClark">Lois &amp; Clark</a></em>. Clark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">addresses the audience</a> that unless they saw the show they would probably not get the joke.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> viewers don't seem to be aware that Roger's distinctive voice and mannerisms (done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>) are intended to parody <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulLynde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PaulLynde">Paul Lynde</a>.
<ul><li> Lynde is a frequent victim of this trope, as his voice is imitated quite often in cartoons. The result is that some animation fans think of his voice as a stock cartoon voice used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> or just plain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> male characters and aren't aware that all those voices stem from one man. He did some voice work himself, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> 'toons <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop">The Perils of Penelope Pitstop</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CharlottesWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CharlottesWeb">Charlotte's Web</a></em>. HB were so well known for using celebrity imitators in their cartoons, that even people who have heard of Mr. Lynde probably assumed it was an imitation. On the other hand, since Lynde <em>was</em> so commonly imitated, people will often assume that any cartoon from the 1970s or earlier that includes a Lynde-like voice has him doing that voice - but sometimes it isn't. (Alan Sues is frequently mistaken for Lynde, for example.)
</li><li> What they <em>really</em> aren't aware of is that Lynde admitted he borrowed his manner of speaking and mannerisms from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AliceGhostley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AliceGhostley">Alice Ghostley</a>, a popular Broadway star of the '50s who later became a Hollywood character actress.
<ul><li> Interestingly, both Lynde and Ghostley each had a recurring role on the TV series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bewitched">Bewitched</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> For that matter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>'s penchant for referencing 1980s TV and movies, along with 1950s lounge music, has made his shows into a Weird Al Effect machine for people too young to remember those decades (AKA the vast majority of his audience). <em>Family Guy</em> is a much bigger offender than <em>American Dad</em>, though.
</li><li> The opening titles of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> are a parody of the opening titles of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllInTheFamily">All in the Family</a></em>, something that is completely lost on younger viewers.
</li><li> Ask anyone about the song "Surfin' Bird" and they'll most likely attribute it to Family Guy instead of its original creators, the Trashmen.
<ul><li> Although see the music section above - it wasn't originaly the Trashmen's either.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Family Guy</em>'s penchant for obscurity runs the gamut — especially when it comes to parodies. For example, a number of people might recognize a song they play straight — such as "Shipoopi" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMusicMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMusicMan">The Music Man</a></em> — but how many people actually know that the "Fellas at the Freakin' FCC" song from the episode "PTV" is sung to the tune of a song from an obscure Broadway musical called <em>Take Me Along</em>?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a>'s love of old movies, demonstrated in the score reference to <em>The Sea Hawk</em> during a car chase seen that turns in to a parody of age of sail ship to ship battles.
</li><li> Go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and search for any scene or clip from a pop culture phenomenon that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> has parodied or mentioned. Most of the comments will consist of, "I thought <em>Family Guy</em> created this!"
<ul><li> With the possible exception of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>. For now.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em>:
<ul><li> The "Don't you believe it!" line in a couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> cartoons is clearly a reference to one of the openings to the NBC Radio show <a class="urllink" href="http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=491245">"The Passing Parade"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. 'Don't you believe it!' was a radio program back in the mid to late forties. This program was run by Toby Reed. In the beginning of the show they listed off a number of trivia type things, "and say if you believe so and so ... Don't you believe it!" then it went on to explain what really happened in a kind of documentary style. Today this joke has gotten so obscure that hardly anyone remembers it.
</li><li> Another episode had a small robotic mouse walking back and forth repeating "Come out and see me some time". This was a reference to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeWest">Mae West</a>'s once-notorious line: "Come <em>up</em> and see me sometime".
</li></ul></li><li> Double example: the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em> was a parody of the theme from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes">Hogan's Heroes</a></em>, which in turn was a parody of the march from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatEscape">The Great Escape</a></em>.
</li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore">Fillmore!</a></em> is ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shaft">Shaft</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">In School!</a> (with a heavy helping of 1970's cop movies and TV shows thrown in). Although the show was loved by many fans, supposedly part of the reason is was cancelled is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">the suits</a> felt the kiddie target demographic didn't get all the 1970's references <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompletelyMissingThePoint">(and believed that it mattered whether the kids got all the references or not).</a>
</li><li> Snagglepuss is, so far, an aversion. While his voice is based on Bert Lahr's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">cowardly lion</a>, the original is still well enough known as to avoid the Weird Al effect.
<ul><li> Yet Snagglepus himself is sometimes confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePinkPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePinkPanther">The Pink Panther</a> in countries where that character is more familiar.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedUpToEleven">exists almost entirely on this trope</a>. Giant robot anime, movies, cartoons, tv shows, literature, pop culture, obscure throw-away characters from other series, actors, conspiracy theories, theoretical physics, urban legends, real life... Everything is a source for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">what is likely the most awesome cartoon ever made</a>.
</li><li> When they're parodying a certain musician, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> will sometimes use a modified version of their existing material, resulting in a lot of viewers giving them full credit for it.
<ul><li> If you're a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> viewer who doesn't listen to popular music, you might not know that the song at the end of "Fishsticks" is a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a> song "Heartless". Given enough time, even those who do probably won't recognize it, leaving poor Kanye's musical career <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopculturalOsmosis">eclipsed by a song about gay fish</a>.
</li><li> The two episodes featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>-"Meet the Jeffersons" and "Dead Celebrities"-used three songs as the basis for his musical bits: "Heal the World" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Dangerous">Dangerous</a></em> and "Childhood" and "You Are Not Alone" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HistoryPastPresentAndFutureBookI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HistoryPastPresentAndFutureBookI">HIStory: Past, Present And Future, Book I</a></em>. Seeing as all three were lesser known relative to his other hits, it can be easy to miss them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Disney villain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MickeyMouseComicUniverseAntagonists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/MickeyMouseComicUniverseAntagonists">Phantom Blot</a> is a parody of a character in many film serials, the main villain whose face is hidden in a cloak until the final episode reveals him to be a character already familiar to the audience. This was a recognizable stock character when the Blot was introduced in 1939. Now the serials are forgotten, but the character lives on.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em> used quite a few "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InkSuitActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InkSuitActor">special guest voices</a>" of celebrities of the era given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Punny Names</a>, such as "Ann-Margrock" for actress Ann-Margaret and "Jimmy Darrock" for Jimmy Darren. Kids who grew up watching the reruns would have had no clue who these people were.
</li><li> Rarity's song "Art of the Dress" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> is done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheStyleOf">In the Style of...</a> the song "Putting It Together" by Barbra Streisand. The former is much more popular and many people only know of "Putting It Together" from "Art Of The Dress".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em> is a parody of the stop-motion Christian cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveyAndGoliath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaveyAndGoliath">Davey and Goliath</a></em>. Not many people realize it due to the latter being a niche work from the 60s.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>:
<ul><li> The theme song is sung to the tune of the sea shanty "Blow The Man Down", and has become more popular than the original song.
</li><li> Barnacle Boy is likely a lot more well-known at this point than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aqualad</a>, the character he is pretty clearly a parody of. Aqualad himself has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> for decades in comic continuity, largely due to the issues DC's long had with making Aquaman on his own work. He's gained some recognition in the years since the show's debut due to his appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, but those incarnations of the character are so far removed from the classic version that Barnacle Boy is based off of that the connection is likely still lost among viewers.
</li><li> Indeed, the original <em>Mermaid Man &amp; Barnacle Boy</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> is clearly based on the 1960s <em>Aquaman</em> series produced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation">Filmation</a>. Though when <em>SpongeBob</em> premiered in 1999 the shorts had been rerun over on the Cartoon Network, nowadays you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone aware of the Filmation Aquaman (other than comic-book geeks and die-hard animation fans).
</li><li> "Sweet Victory" has been so ingrained into the show (to the point of where the Super Bowl LIII received backlash for not playing it during their halftime show) that most people don't realize that the song was actually recorded by David Glen Eisley for a stock music library. It <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColbertBump">was almost unheard of</a> prior to the airing of "Band Geeks".
</li><li> The <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NFLFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NFLFilms">NFL Films</a> song "The Lineman" is probably better known as the theme of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy than its original use.
</li></ul></li><li> How many viewers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop">The Perils of Penelope Pitstop</a></em> realised it was a pastiche of 1910s film serials like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerilsOfPauline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePerilsOfPauline">The Perils of Pauline</a></em> (1914)? Okay, now how many realised the Hooded Claw is specifically based on the villain from the follow-up to <em>Pauline</em>, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExploitsOfElaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheExploitsOfElaine">The Exploits Of Elaine</a></em> (1914), who was known as the Clutching Hand? Note that the Clutching Hand was "the first mystery villain to appear in a film serial", and became the template for every mystery villain in the genre.
<ul><li> Many people may also believe that <em>The Perils of Pauline</em> and <em>The Exploits of Elaine</em> were invented by Scott Westerfield for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Leviathan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Leviathan">Leviathan</a></em> books.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em>'s characters are obvious clones of historical figures - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MahatmaGandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JoanOfArc">Joan of Arc</a>, and so on. Even minor characters are based on historical figures (with the exception of Principal Scudworth). There are, however, some that may have slipped past viewers:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Mr. Butlertron</a> is a parody of the titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBelvedere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBelvedere">Mr. Belvedere</a></em>, down to calling everyone Wesley. The creators even wanted to name him "Mr. Belvetron", but they couldn't get the rights. This parody would go right over the heads of anyone who watched the series today.

For example, Tom's song "Let It Burn" is an actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Usher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Usher">Usher</a> song. Other episodes are based on real life events or real people (often times word-for-word), including the teacher who says the "n" word at Riley and the gay prisoner with the beanie.

In 1994's "Bart Gets an Elephant", Wiggum, skeptical of reports of damage caused by a rogue elephant, exclaimed "And I'm Edward G. Robinson" - complete with vocalization. Similarly, in "Simpsons Bible Stories", Moses's story has Wiggum playing an Egyptian foreman clearly inspired on Robinson's role as Dathan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments">The Ten Commandments</a></em>, down to the line "Where's your Messiah NOW?"

</li><li> Professor Frink is a parody of comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerryLewis">Jerry Lewis</a>' nerdy characters, again something that is lost on younger generations. Though it has ultimately come full circle in the <em>Treehouse of Horror</em> segment "Frinkenstein" in which Professor Frink brings his father back from the dead. Who plays his father? Take a wild guess! This in turn is rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meta">Meta</a>, as seeing as Frink was created from the style of Jerry Lewis, Jerry in a sense <em>is</em> his father.

</li><li> Gil Gunderson, the unlucky salesman, is a take-off of a similar character, Shelley Levene, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GlengarryGlenRoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GlengarryGlenRoss">Glengarry Glen Ross</a></em>.
</li><li> In the DVD commentary track for the fourth season, the writers doing the commentary specifically point out that the scene at the end of "Selma's Choice" where Selma is shown cradling her new pet iguana to the tune of "You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman" is a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurphyBrown">Murphy Brown</a></em> singing to her newborn son, because they were afraid viewers wouldn't "get it".
</li><li> "Classic" horror concepts are frequently parodied in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror">Treehouse of Horror</a></em> episodes. Most younger viewers, especially outside the United States, who never saw <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959">The Twilight Zone</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963">The Outer Limits</a></em> don't realize many plots were borrowed from these TV series. Even more obscure is one segment that parodies a segment from the less known <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmazingStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmazingStories">Amazing Stories</a></em> fantasy/science-fiction anthology titled "Hell Toupee". Unlike its cousins, <em>Amazing Stories</em> didn't usually go into horror, and the original tale was fairly light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek... making it even less likely it would be recognized more than the parody.
<ul><li> This was itself parodied in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, where Butters, having developed an obsession with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsBeenDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsBeenDone">not being accused of copying</a> <em>The Simpsons</em>, claims that the episode's plot is a ripoff of a <em>Treehouse of Horror</em> episode. Chef points out that not only does this not matter, but that episode was already a parody of an episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Most people associate the phrase "D'oh!" with Homer Simpson. However, it comes from James Finlayson in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">Laurel and Hardy</a> film series, which is something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanCastellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a> himself admitted in at least one interview.
</li><li> The main theme from the 1991 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapeFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapeFear">Cape Fear</a></em> was rather famous in its day, as it is a wonderfully atmospheric piece that evokes just the right sense of impending terror. Today, it is almost universally known as Sideshow Bob's theme music, thanks to an episode which parodied the film and played the theme from the movie whenever Bob was around.
<ul><li> That theme is even older, since it is based on part of Bernard Herrmann's score for the 1962 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapeFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CapeFear">Cape Fear</a></em> (played once at the very end).
</li><li> Eventually the creators took notice of this and made it Bob's official <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Leitmotif">leitmotif</a>. In later seasons, a few bars of it always play whenever he shows up.
</li><li> Similarly, in a few years all the references to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier">Frasier</a></em> that tend to go hand-in-hand with Bob episodes will be meaningless.
</li><li> Another musical relation in <em>The Simpsons</em> shows Homer singing modified lyrics to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoveredUp">Frank Sinatra's</a> "It Was A Very Good Year" (when he was remembering the time he bought his first six-pack at a liquor store with an obviously fake ID — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">It is best not to think about how he got away with it</a>). Anyone thinking of the song nowadays is likely to think of Homer's rendition.
</li></ul></li><li> Itchy and Scratchy are an extreme parody of typical animated cat-and-mouse cartoon series like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHuckleberryHoundShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheHuckleberryHoundShow">Pixie Dixie And Mr Jinks</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HermanAndKatnip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HermanAndKatnip">Herman and Katnip</a>... and the violence typically found in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation">1940s and 1950s animated cartoons</a>. Back in the day these cartoons were broadcast daily over the entire world and thus everybody immediately understood the reference. Today, ever since Cartoon Network bought most of the rights, you hardly see these classic cartoons anywhere except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>. Thus, the original joke will be totally lost on younger audiences. In the case of Herman and Katnip, the rights to the film series have changed owners many times, and the cartoons themselves were often unavailable to a wider audience for decades.

</li><li> Nowadays, people are likely to associate <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaintYourWagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaintYourWagon">Paint Your Wagon</a></em> with the episode "All Singing, All Dancing", in which Homer and Bart mistakenly think it is a typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ClintEastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DollarsTrilogy">western</a>, with even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AluminumChristmasTrees">surprised to find out that it is an actual movie</a> made <em>after</em> Eastwood became famous.
</li><li> A couple decades after the show gave us "The Monorail Song," a parody of "Trouble" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan">The Music Man</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> did its own parody called "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000." The result was an amusing dichotomy where the show's target audience thought it was a reference to the Simpsons version, while the show's famous older <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeripheryDemographic">Periphery Demographic</a> knew the original version.
</li><li> "The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"'s parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MagnumPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MagnumPI">Magnum, P.I.</a></em> still mostly lands, as it remains a decently-known series and most of its cliches are common to its genre. On the other hand, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyMotherTheCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MyMotherTheCar">My Mother the Car</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BradyBunchSpinOffs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BradyBunchSpinOffs">Variety Hour</a></em> were, even at the time, pretty quickly fading into memory, and were largely considered among the worst shows of all time. Reportedly, Matt Groening was concerned that viewers would think the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">deliberately awful</a> parts of them would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoesLaw">mistaken for the real thing.</a>

<ul><li> You always remember people based on the physical features and characterisations that are different than others. As a result people you know are remembered as caricatures of their physical features or behaviour more than how they actually look and behave. For instance:
<ul><li> Prince Charles' ears have been exaggerated in cartoons so often that many people often imagine them to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Dumbo">Dumbo-sized</a>. In the BBC documentary series <em>The Human Face</em> they used him as an example by first simply tracing the lines of a photograph of him into a realistic drawing. As a result he was unrecognizable.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> has appeared in so many cartoons as a heartless crook that this portrayal has become confused with the real man.

Indeed, once Carvey's impression gained traction, anyone else's impression of Bush Sr. was most often an imitation of Carvey's impression.
</li><li> Many dictators like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuammarGaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IdiAmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IdiAmin">Idi Amin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SaddamHussein">Saddam Hussein</a>... have also been caricatured as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> lunatics. This is also how they live on in people's perceptions, even though if they were all as nuts as some parodies make them they would have never been able to remain in power for so long.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElvisPresley">Elvis Presley</a>'s greasy quiff has been elongated to such absurd lengths in caricatures that people may actually be surprised to learn it was actually not five foot long in reality.

Cosby's routine is now much better known than the original sketch. Ba-bump, ba-bump, ba-bump...
<ul><li> The "Lights Out" sketch was itself based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">then-popular news</a> of an experiment that <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Carrel#Cellular_senescence">kept chicken heart tissue alive for 20 years in a lab<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Said experiment is very obscure today — and the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">its results were probably spurious</a> did not help.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickenJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickenJoke">Chicken Joke</a>: "Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side". Despite being used as the mascot of joke-telling, it's really a parody of other jokes. Where most jokes end with some kind of pun, "To get to the other side" is a straight answer that only works if the listener was expected something absurd. People are now conditioned to accept the answer as funny without even thinking about it.
</li><li> Plenty of modern media references "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotAdjustYourSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotAdjustYourSet">Do Not Adjust Your Set</a>" to mean "this weirdness is real". The phrase was first used in this sense in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963">The Outer Limits</a></em>, but it originated years earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">as a warning to viewers that the station was experiencing technical difficulties</a>. "Do Not Adjust Your Set" meant "the problem's on our end, not yours, so don't go fiddling with the antenna".
</li><li> The expression "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreExperiencingTechnicalDifficulties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreExperiencingTechnicalDifficulties">technical difficulties</a>" is now highly likely to be used as a euphemism for a person (or even a society) going insane, or even for something disastrous or off-color (as, most hilariously, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProblemChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ProblemChild">Problem Child</a> 2</em>), rather than something as mundane as a problem with a broadcaster's equipment.
</li><li> Weird Al, who loved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrDemento">Dr. Demento</a> and got his start on the show, probably laments the fact that the <em>still-running</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.drdemento.com/">Dr. Demento show<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has been almost forgotten except by connection to him. (To wit, he's gone <a class="urllink" href="http://www.geekosystem.com/dr-demento-radio-show-over/">internet-only<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.)
</li><li> Any cartoon, video game, film, etc. made prior to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> that wasn't Disney-popular that was parodied in and after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> will get this effect in Eastern Europe due to that region locked away from Western pop-culture for 50 years (where only the very best of the West passed the border).
<ul><li> Other communist countries like China and especially North Korea also suffer from this. China has opened up more to the West since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaoZedong">Mao Zedong</a>'s death, but North Korea remains the most isolated country in the world.
</li><li> The same happened in Nazi occupied Europe during World War Two. A lot of early 1940s American films only reached the European continent after the end of the war. This also explains why so many comedians from the interbellum (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarxBrothers">Marx Brothers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>) remained far more popular and well known in Europe than American comedians who made their debut during the war (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AbbottAndCostello">Abbott and Costello</a>, for instance). For example, the 1978 Greek entry for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> was the tribute song "Charlie Chaplin". It was intended to mark the then-recent death of Chaplin (he died in 1977), and primarily refers to his still-popular "Little Tramp" persona.
</li></ul></li><li> The name "Barcalounger" (the brand of reclining chair) is a play on a the name of a type of sailing ship, the Barca-longa. No one but naval historians and readers of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AubreyMaturin">Aubrey-Maturin</a></em> series (which are not such distinct populations) would know that now.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a> goes meta with this in "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19109_6-things-our-kids-just-plain-wont-get.html">6 Things Our Kids Just Won't Get<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", which includes the save icon (floppy disk), time-related TV activities such as Saturday morning cartoons (thanks to cable becoming commonplace and DVRs which allow people to watch things whenever they want), and common older sitcom plots, such as plots when someone gets lost (nowadays people would just call them on a cell phone).
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applejack_(beverage)">Applejack<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was originally a potent form of distilled apple brandy. However, for the last few decades it has been more commonly known as a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Jacks">breakfast cereal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that once counterintuitively used the fact that it <em>doesn't</em> taste like apples as a marketing gimmick. And now that the cereal commercials aren't airing as frequently, a lot of people now associate "Applejack" with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/FriendshipIsMagicApplejack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/FriendshipIsMagicApplejack">the My Little Pony character of the same name.</a>
</li><li> The McIntosh apple <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">dates back to 1811</a>. No, not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AppleMacintosh">Apple Macintosh</a>, a McIntosh apple. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment">Apple named the computer after a type of apple.</a> Averted for most Canadians, since the McIntosh apple was first bred there.
</li><li> Chucky, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ChildsPlay">Child's Play</a>,</em> is believed to have been based on a real toy called "My Buddy", which was only slightly less creepy. Other people believe that he was based on the "That Kid" doll.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note285vda');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note285vda" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note285vda');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He was actually supposed to be based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/CabbagePatchKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/CabbagePatchKids">Cabbage Patch Kids</a>, but considering the My Buddy line <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRedStapler">took a noticeable hit in sales</a> ever since <em>Child's Play</em>... it <em>really</em> didn't work out as intended.</span>
</li><li> Anyone growing up in the US in the last 50 years will be more likely to recognize the name of Martin Luther King, Jr., than the name of Martin Luther, whom Dr. King was named after.
</li><li> Any denizen of the Internet knows about demotivational posters. On the other hand, the kind of motivational posters they're based on aren't nearly as well-known, especially outside the USA.
<ul><li> Anyone who's worked in any kind of office environment is likely to recognize them, or at the very least take a closer look to see if it's a demotivator or the real thing.
</li></ul></li><li> The term "shooting brake" is now making a comeback, on which the definition is generally accepted as a type of station wagon that has a coupe-like roofline, with only two doors instead of five. The common belief was that the term was just an archaic name for the more familiar station wagon or estate, but nobody realizes that term originated from roofed carriages that are normally used as hunting vehicles, complete with storage for guns and ammunition. Only after the rise of motorized vehicles did shooting brakes evolved into customized wagons used for hunting towards the present form.
<ul><li> Similarly, the term "brake". Unlike the apparatus that forces the vehicle to slow down, these brakes are used to refer as carriages that "break-in" spirited horses (read: tame hyper horses for carriage work). The only usage for this term is on French car companies, only because the French word for station wagon is "break."
</li></ul></li><li> Any old black and white movie from the first half of the 20th century has scratches and missing frames on the pellicule. This has led many younger generations to believe those scratches and missing frames were actually made on purpose! As if these films have always been in bad shape.
</li><li> Oreos, "Milk's Favorite Cookie", are actually a shameless knockoff of a brand called "Hydrox". However, the immense popularity of Oreos forced Hydrox into obscurity, and people nowadays believe that <em>Hydrox</em> is the knockoff (to the extent that the bulk of poor Hydrox's advertising now centers around pointing out they were on the market first).
</li><li> Many street names are named after famous people. Some of them very famous to this day, others haven fallen in such obscurity that you have to consult an encyclopaedia to find out who they were and what they did to earn a street named after them. Although, in some cases (like Adelaide, South Australia), the street naming committee just named the streets after their own members, because they could, basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoking this</a>.
</li><li> Chef Al Yeganeh, the New York proprietor of "Soup Kitchen International" (later "The Original Soupman"), and the real life inspiration for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em>'s Soup Nazi was in buisness about ten years prior to the episode that made him famous. Despite his insistence to the contrary, prior to Seinfeld, Al Yeganeh was an obscure New York figure known mostly to certain circles of affluent late 80s/early 90s Manhattan yuppies who were willing to pay $30 for a pint of soup. Nearly everyone else knows of him because of the Soup Nazi episode. In one TV interview, he seriously claims that he made Seinfeld famous. In an interesting subversion of the trope, many feel that the <em>Seinfeld</em> version is relatively tame compared to the real man who has been known to use profanities such as calling a female reporter a "bitch" on camera in one instance.
</li><li> Conservative cultural critic Rod Dreher came up with the term <a class="urllink" href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/the-menace-of-earwabbits/comment-page-1/">earwabbit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to describe when you can't hear a traditional song or piece of classical music without thinking of a pop culture spoof. He chose earwabbit as a reference to the Looney Tunes spoof of Ride of the Valkyries, which is discussed elsewhere on this page.
</li><li> Brown Windsor Soup is a by-word for disgusting British cookery at its early-to-mid-twentieth-century nadir. Problem is, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.foodsofengland.co.uk/brownwindsorsoup.htm">there are no<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> reliable references to it existing before the mid-1940s, and the majority of references for the first few decades afterwards are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">Self-Deprecation</a> jokes about horrible British railway/hotel/restaurant cuisine. In fact, it appears to have originally begun as a comic reference to a real, but now forgotten product called Brown Windsor so<strong>a</strong>p, obviously the reverse of anything made for human consumption. Despite this, some "traditional British" cookbooks and websites, including Jamie Oliver's, have attempted to reverse engineer an (edible) Brown Windsor Soup, usually involving some kind of meat consomme.
</li><li> The phrase "Big Bang Theory" is more likely to bring to mind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">the CBS sitcom</a> than the actual hypothesis of how the universe came about.
</li><li> The German version of Weird Al might be comedian Otto Waalkes (just think of his Pfefferkuchen epos parodying the Neue Deutsche Welle) but in general, the trope is less pronounced in Germany.
