Sometimes, when somebody goes through a severe, emotionally traumatic experience or suffers a physical head injury, their brain removes the memory of that event; this causes Trauma-Induced Amnesia. These memories can be often recovered over time through therapy, magic, or whatever is appropriate in the setting; but sometimes, another traumatic experience will bring them to the surface in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a> form. Sometimes depicted as appearing only in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PastExperienceNightmare">Past Experience Nightmares</a>, which often results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingTheTruth">Dreaming the Truth</a>. Sometimes, the memories simply come back on their own. Or with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfLove">The Power of Love</a>.

The reason he never appeared in front of either of his brothers before that point was because the same incident that made everyone think he was dead also caused him to be badly injured <em>and</em> lose his memory.

Ukyo tries to keep her from worrying about it, since such knowledge would include his split-personality, and its attempt in killing her. He does eventually explain what happened.
</li><li> Shirou of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> has no memory of his life before the Fuyuki City fire.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder12');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder12" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, at least as far as <em>physical</em> trauma (especially to the head) is concerned. Global amnesia is a very real phenomenon that affects people who have been in car accidents and similar traumatic incidents. On the end of emotional or psychological trauma, there is vigorous debate to what extent it occurs, but dissociative disorders - particularly dissociative amnesia - are what this trope is based off of.
<ul><li> It falls under a category called 'Motivated Forgetting'. It is divided into two categories - repression and suppression. Repression is the Sigmund Freud style "it's too hurtful to remember so your subconscious buries it" stuff, and suppression is when you actively try to forget something. Repression has a little bit of evidence in that child abuse victims often can not recall the abuse later in life. Suppression can also occur to a certain degree, wherein people who concentrate on forgetting something are less likely to be able to recall it at a later time when asked to do so.
</li><li> It may not really count as forgetting, but shocking events which take a very short time to happen sometimes simply don't register in the brain in the first place; this can happen to road accident victims or similar. A head injury that results in immediate unconsciousness is virtually <em>never</em> recalled afterwards, because the same trauma that forces the brain to interrupt consciousness also interrupts the process of memory storage.
</li><li> Dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue disorder<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7i9qe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7i9qe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7i9qe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a condition characterized by long-term departure from one's home and the psychological creation of a new identity.</span>, and dissociative identity disorder <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8d83j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8d83j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8d83j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a condition characterized by the presence of multiple, independent identities and one that is the subject of a great deal of debate among psychologists.</span> are the most extreme cases. Of course debate rages on as to how many true or planted examples there have been, but theoretically the brain is malleable enough when young so that if you experience emotional trauma as a very small child, your mind can protect itself by "pushing away" the memories, believing it didn't happen or it happened to someone else. But even if you don't remember it, it's still there. The brain can protect itself from immediate damage by blocking out the harmful memories themselves, but the trauma will always find some other way to manifest itself until it's dealt with.
</li></ul></li><li> When he was a boy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> saw a friend hit by a train; he claims to have no memory of the incident.
</li><li> The sources that tend to assert that emotionally and psychologically traumatic events <em>can't</em> be forgotten (Ever) tend to be technically correct, in the adrenaline and heightened stimulus response in the hippocampus and parahippocampus of the brain tend to embed traumatic events more strongly in an individual's memory. However, that said, this trope does occur regularly and this is why: although the event itself cannot be forgotten, the mind will deliberately sublimate and repress the traumatic memory in order to try to retain a degree of emotional and mental stability in the case where an event would be traumatic enough to instigate a dissociative fugue. Many victims of violence, particularly sexual violence as children, will not remember the events until either a trigger brings back the suppressed memory or the memory suppression eventually resolves itself as the mind starts to deal with and handle the trauma (usually when the individual is an adult and emotionally stable enough to deal with it) - the memory often starting to re-appear through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamingTheTruth">dreams or nightmares</a>. Usually in these cases, there will be a generalised dissociative state immediately following the traumatic event, and some changes in behaviour or personality may be noticed over the short term.
<ul><li> One question that is asked of people being assessed for PTSD is whether or not they're unable to remember a significant part of a traumatic event. For those who are, they'll be able to remember a great deal of what traumatized them in horrifying detail with the exception of a portion of what happened to them.
</li></ul></li><li> Holocaust Survivor Zoltan Zinn Collis, who was saved from Bergin Belsen concentration camp at the age of five, claims to remember atrocities, but to have no memory of his own emotional response to them at the time. This is known as dissociation and is quite common among those who have lived through a trauma.
</li><li> Between the physical and psychological trauma, the Central Park Jogger, Tricia Meili, has no memory of the night she was attacked beyond leaving her apartment to go for her nightly run.
