They take center stage, right wrongs, find stuff out, do a bit of rescuing and learn all about themselves in the process.
</p><p>Which is all well and good for those characters and their fans... but what about everyone else? Come to think of it, we haven't seen Bert in three months. Where did he go?
</p><p>Out of Focus is the flip side of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">Character Focus</a>. When they show less and less of a character, seen in the background flying under the radar in obscurity with extremely little screen time, living in the shadows of other prominent standouts. While someone's hogging the limelight with a lot of screen time in abundance, other members of the cast fly under the radar with a serious decrease in screen time. Particularly luckless characters may <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor">vanish for extended periods of time without any particular explanation,</a> only to be brought back as if nothing's happened. A consequence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a>.
Webcomics are particularly prone to this. It's easy to see why — when you've got a cast of twenty characters and only four panels available, it's obvious that someone's going to lose out. If a character isn't central to the plot, with such limited space (and usually, time) available, it's probably a waste of time putting said character in at all. Webcomic readers usually understand this, but even the most tolerant and faithful of readers may get a little dissatisfied if a character, who was formerly one of the main cast, has been sighted less frequently than the Loch Ness Monster.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>If a character is absent for too long, that character risks suffering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</a>, dropping off the face of the Earth, never to be seen again. Alternatively, these characters may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> when the creator decides (s)he has no further use for them. If they return after the nature of the story has changed in their absence — for example, the plot has come down with a nasty case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a> — and they don't seem to fit in with the tone any more, they may become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">The Artifact</a>. Out of Focus can be averted, or compensated for, by using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotatingArcs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RotatingArcs">Rotating Arcs</a> or by the creator reassuring the fans that Captain Superhero hasn't died and will be back as soon as he's relevant to the story.
</p><p>This also often happens for optional characters, but as you'll notice, they're...well, optional, so the events are written without them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Shazam">Shazam</a></em>:
<ul><li> Captain Marvel/Shazam got a lot of this treatment, having slipped into something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> in the 2000s, and has received very little attention from DC titles. His nemesis, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackAdam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackAdam">Black Adam</a>, was been given much more attention, including major parts in various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossovers</a> and acclaimed, lengthy series. The reason given for Marvel's shoddy appearances in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDidio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanDidio">Dan Didio</a>, is "He doesn't fit in." This might be because DC (and Didio in particular) was pushing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>, and Captain Marvel has always been associated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a>. Which would explain why Black Adam, who can best be described as "Captain Marvel as an antihero" is getting all the spotlight. Captain Marvel underwent a reboot in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a></em> series, but very little was done with him afterwards. He'd eventually, <em>finally</em> get a proper ongoing in 2018, but the problem there is that the series is perpetually late and is very isolated from the rest of the DCU, though it is still an improvement.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryMarvel">Mary Marvel</a>, in the reboot. Despite the fact that she's been around since the 1940s and used to be a superheroine in her own right, she's given no more attention or importance than newcomers Darla, Eugene, and Pedro. This is in stark contrast to Freddy, who quickly becomes Billy's best friend and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a>, and is treated as a more significant character than the rest of the foster siblings.

</li><li> Many, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">many</a></em> characters at any given time in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a>.</em> At least once, a year once went by with the main character, Gina, only appearing in occasional cameos.

The writers usually focus their attention on him since, not only is he their king, but he's much more powerful than the others and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">just looks really cool.</a> The others usually stand in the background and look concerned. Even then, the Inhumans as a whole, including Black Bolt, are generally not used outside of a few miniseries every few years and as supporting characters. they were in the spotlight in the early and mid 2010's, but the family disappeared again later.

<ul><li> Of the original five, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iceman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Iceman">Iceman</a> gets the least focus and character development. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Scott</a>, being the leader and all, is one of the more focused characters. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JeanGrey">Jean</a>, when she's alive, gets a lot of focus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BeastMarvelComics">Beast</a> is very focused on as the team's main scientist, and later as a member of the Avengers and Illuminati, and Angel has the whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> Archangel stuff going for him.

</li><li> The overwhelming majority of X-kids will have this happen to them. They will usually be created to have newer teen characters occupy that space as younger X-Men, and allow the regular cast to serve as mentors. However, once they've been around for about a decade, expect to see a handful <em>at best</em> get anything to do or even have their name said, while the rest of their classmates become background characters or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CListFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CListFodder">C-List Fodder</a>. It's easier to note the <em>exceptions</em> to this, who get largely consistent use, which are Kitty Pryde, Magik, Jubilee (sometimes) and X-23.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em>, since his return during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FinalCrisis">Final Crisis</a></em>, has a tendency to focus on Barry Allen above other characters.
<ul><li> Jay Garrick, Barry's predecessor, was originally not hit too hard by this because he was a regular in the <em>Justice Society of America</em> ongoing. However, after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> rebooted the DCU in 2011, Jay was relegated to the alternate universe-based <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Earth2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Earth2">Earth 2</a></em> where he was in-focus for about 15 issues before getting this treatment <em>again</em>. DC Rebirth had him as part of the long-running <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> but he did very little aside from two guest appearances and only fully returned in the <em>last month</em> of the 2010s as a decade.
</li><li> Wally West, Barry's successor, fell increasingly out of focus to the point that, after <em>The Flash: Rebirth</em>, he barely appeared at all before being rebooted out of existence by <em>Flashpoint</em>. He didn't even exist until 2014, which introduced a new iteration of him, who himself fell out of focus after negative reception. The original Wally would return as part of DC Rebirth in 2016, and would be given some focus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TitansRebirth">Titans (Rebirth)</a></em>, before mishandling there led him to returning to the pages of <em>The Flash</em> and getting a large amount of focus, and then being central to a crossover and getting his own miniseries.
</li><li> Wally's successor and Barry's grandson, Bart Allen, also faced this somewhat after Barry's return. He returned to his role of Kid Flash when Barry returned, and was spared this initially, being given some appearances in <em>The Flash</em> and <em>Teen Titans</em>. Then <em>Flashpoint</em> rebooted everything and he was starring in <em>Teen Titans</em> exclusively, bar one guest appearance in <em>The Flash</em>, and got <em>one</em> arc focusing on him. He was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> after that arc and briefly returned before disappearing again. The <em>real</em> Bart Allen only properly returned during the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FlashWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FlashWar">Flash War</a>" storyline, and would go on to appear in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice2019">Young Justice (2019)</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Any non-human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> not named Kilowog will be hit by this. Every time a Green Lantern needs some supporting Lanterns, writers tend to pick the one or two they like, and make up some new ones. The ones who get the most focus are Kilowog, Arisia and Soranik Natu.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Earth2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Earth2">Earth 2</a></em>, the new "trinity", Alan Scott, Jay Garrick and Kendra Saunders, were all put out of focus when new writer Tom Taylor came on board. He instead focused on the original trinity and their supporting cast.

Wilbur Wolfingham dropped into complete obscurity; and the Prankster and Toy Man were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> in the late Fifties just before the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">The Silver Age of Comic Books</a> and only intermittently came back, never really returning to their early prominence. The Prankster in particular was for a long stretch in the Forties Superman's single most frequently appearing foe, but was so severely demoted that he only appeared <em>once</em> in the Sixties.

</li><li> The premise behind <em>The Marvel Saga: The Official History of the Marvel Universe</em> is to take excerpts of the various unrelated stories of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> and put them roughly in chronological order (though certain character backgrounds and origins are generally saved for when the character in question is first introduced in the "main" narrative). For most of its 25-issue run, the focus was broad, shifting between the various superheroes. When the editors changed from Danny Fingeroth to Adam Blaustein on Issue 22 (a special issue looking back on the relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson">Mary Jane Watson</a> in honor of their wedding), however, the focus changed entirely to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>'s adventures, detailing Reed and Sue's wedding<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qsjc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qsjc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qsjc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Bedlam at the Baxter Building", from <em>Fantastic Four Annual</em> #3</span>, their inaugural encounters with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInhumans">The Inhumans</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1daik');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1daik" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1daik');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Fantastic Four</em> #s 44-48</span>, and the coming of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2f8ne');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2f8ne" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2f8ne');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Fantastic Four</em> #s 48-50, with the origins of Galactus and the Silver Surfer from <em>Super-Villain Classics</em> #1 and <em>Silver Surfer</em> Vol. 1, #1 included</span>, with the rest of the Marvel Universe reduced to a general overview in a four-page epilogue.

Possibly, this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> — in one strip, Jeremy's mother Connie says, "Wasn't it nice seeing your brother again for a whole week?", but Jeremy simply hadn't noticed he was there; in another, Connie laments Chad's lack of communication.
</li><li> Lately, <em>Zits</em> has nearly completely taken on the perspective of the parents, in order to make more jokes about teenage behavior, and many of Jeremy's friends have been sidelined (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">have disappeared completely</a>) from the comic as a result.

Schroeder almost qualifies in both directions (he first appears about seven months in, and last appears about five months before the end). There are even some indications in very early strips that Shermy (first strip) may have been intended as the main character. Remember Shermy? Exactly. The other character in the first strip, Patty (<em>not</em> Peppermint Patty, who is a different character), hung on much longer than Shermy, but her last appearance is a couple of years before the strip ended.

</li><li> Diego went from being one of the leads to pretty much being a supporting character in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge2TheMeltdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IceAge2TheMeltdown">the 2nd one</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">It has not gotten better for him.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie">A Goofy Movie</a></em> out of context, you probably would not be able to guess that PJ is a <em>main</em> character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, since he's only in about a third of the scenes in the movie and has very few lines and little screentime in most of those. His screentime improves significantly in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnExtremelyGoofyMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnExtremelyGoofyMovie">the sequel</a>, but considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">what he spends the screentime on</a>, it's still a bit low. Pete suffers a similar fate in the first movie, but in his case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">it only got worse.</a>

This is justified, since his character arc from the first film had ended and <em>someone</em> has to guard the Jade Palace while the heroes are away.

According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> this is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesleySnipes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WesleySnipes">Wesley Snipes</a> spent most of the production smoking weed in his trailer and would only come out of his trailer to film close ups. Most of the scenes with Blade were done with his stand in. He also tried to strangle the director, who responded by paying a biker gang to act as his security. After that Blade would only communicate with the crew via Post-It Notes signed "From Blade".
</li><li> A common criticism of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelBay">Michael Bay</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> films is that the Transformers <em>themselves</em> are out of focus in favor of the human and army characters. This is an issue of practicality in the first film though, as the cost of the CGI limited how much screen time the Transformers could actually have. They show up a lot more in the sequels.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AlmostFamous">Almost Famous</a></em> arguably has an in-universe example. In the middle of the movie, Stillwater receives a new batch of t-shirts from the record label - which are quickly discovered to have Russell front and center, with the rest of the band in the back, out of focus. This sets off an argument between Russell and Jeff Bebe on the way Russell has increasingly become the public face of the band, with everyone else fading away. At one point, Jeff Bebe even shouts, "I'm just one of the out of focus guys!"
</li><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> film (Asterix at the Olympic Games) gives more screentime to Lovesix and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticPlotTumor">Romantic Plot Tumor</a> than to Asterix and Obelix, the protagonists of the series.

He barely speaks at all during the movie, disappears after the first room, and when they do the "let's meet the Golden Ticket winners" interviews, his parents did most of the speaking for him. This is mostly because his actor didn't speak English and had to learn all of his lines phonetically, but just notice how very little you see of him.

Carol Ann is missing for a more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheRabbitHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownTheRabbitHole">plot-centric reason</a>. Sadly Dana is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">missing</a> from the sequels, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActorExistenceFailure">well-known reasons</a>.

While her character mostly drives the plot in the first trilogy, her number of appearances decreases considerably afterwards. The second book is about her husband John Carter trying to reunite with her, but she only appears at the very end. After the third book, both her and Carter fade into the background completely.

The latter two have a decent number of appearances for the rest of the first series and the first part of the second series. With the Magic God Othinus arc, however, Touma more or less becomes the sole protagonist again - the other two don't have any impact on the plot of the arc's first two volumes, and only Accelerator has any role in the third.
</li><li> In the second series, many of the magic side characters introduced in the first series end up becoming this. For example, Stiyl and Kaori used to be recurring characters, but they now have few appearances and minimal impact on the plot.

Then there is Carrot, who slowly faded away in the Watch books when he was originally the second most important character (he was originally going to be the main character, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Pterry</a> decided that Vimes was more interesting). Of the witches, Agnes originally seemed set up to become the new 'maiden' of the coven but then vanished, and both Nanny and Granny became supporting characters to Tiffany Aching. (The final book reveals that at some point Agnes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">returned to her singing career and moved to Quirm</span>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a></em>: The two woman introduced at the top of Purgatory represent the opposing lifestyles of activity and contemplation. Matilda is feminine as Aphrodite, quietly peaceful, and concerned with tending her earthly garden; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VitaNuova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VitaNuova">Beatrice</a> is masculine as an admiral, loudly judgmental, and concerned with the contemplation of heavenly truths.
</li><li> Goldmoon and Riverwind are very important characters in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> novel, but after that their story arc is basically finished and they largely recede into the background for the rest of the Chronicles.
</li><li> Edilio from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gone">GONE</a></em> series often falls victim to this, in spite of a overwhelming amount of support from the fanbase. This is discussed/justified in <em>FEAR</em>, the latest <em>GONE</em> novel, where Edilio points out he does have lots of things happening to him, it's just people don't know about it because he doesn't make everything about himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> After having a big role in the plot of the second book, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead">Ginny Weasley</a> fades into the background during books three and four before being back with a vengeance in book five.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Dumbledore's Army</a> is a big part of book five, with the core members even fighting alongside Harry in the final confrontation (which no one but Ron and Hermione had done before). In the next book Harry decides not to bring it back, so it doesn't appear at all - until they spontaneously reunite for the climatic Battle at the end.
</li><li> Since the vast majority of characters in the series are either Gryffindors or Slytherins, Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw don't get a lot of attention. Cedric Diggory and Luna Lovegood are the most prominent characters to be from their respective houses. Cedric is mentioned in the third book but only really plays a big role in the fourth book (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and he dies at the end</span>) and Luna isn't introduced until the fifth. Harry never even makes it to the Hufflepuff common room. Although Newt Scamander, the protagonist of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticBeasts">prequel film series</a> is a Hufflepuff, giving the house a prominent character in the franchise at large. However, there still isn't a prominent Ravenclaw.
</li><li> Hogwarts itself, and with it most secondary characters, during Deathly Hallows.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>title character</em> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> novels has greatly reduced role in the later books, with Yuki and then Mikuru taking a more prominent place. This is possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> because the title character isn't the main character. That role falls to our <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">Narrator</a>, Kyon. Given Kyon's notorious status as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, the titles themselves may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">intentionally misleading</a>.
</li><li> In the first book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em>, we are introduced to Silas and see through his perspective frequently, and it seems as though he is going to be one of the main characters. But virtually all viewpoint character besides Jenna, Septimus, Nicko, and Simon are swept away for the vast majority of the series and only get a few scenes at most per book mentioning what they're up to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStormlightArchive">The Stormlight Archive</a></em>: Szeth gets much less attention in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WordsOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WordsOfRadiance">the second book</a> (specifically, he spends most of the book flying back and forth across the continent), but the focus character of book five.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> usually avoids this, despite its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>, but there are still several examples.
<ul><li> Hawkfrost, a major character in the ten previous books had his role reduced to ominously floating around ThunderClan camp a few times from <em>Long Shadows</em> to <em>The Fourth Apprentice</em>. However, he became important again from <em>Fading Echoes</em> to <em>The Last Hope</em>, serving as one of the main recruiters of the Dark Forest.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCatsOmenOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCatsOmenOfTheStars">Warrior Cats: Omen of the Stars</a></em> series, other than a handful of scenes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritAdvisor">Spirit Advisor</a> Spottedleaf mostly disappeared from the plot, with her role as an adviser being given to Yellowfang.
</li><li> In the <em>SkyClan and the Stranger</em> manga, many characters who were important in <em>Firestar's Quest</em> and <em>SkyClan's Destiny</em>, such as Egg and Frecklewish, simply disappear from the story. This is one of the more understandable times it happened, seeing as <em>SkyClan and the Stranger</em> is a manga that's about 300 pages long, while the rest of the SkyClan Saga is nearly 1000 pages of print featuring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>.
</li><li> RiverClan's role in the plot is significantly diminished in <em>Power of Three</em> and <em>Omen of the Stars</em>, although this is due to ThunderClan no longer sharing a border with them.
</li><li> Cinderheart is a major character in the first four books of <em>Power of Three</em>, but after her first character arc is wrapped up in <em>Eclipse</em>, she gets little more than a passing mention in <em>Long Shadows</em> and <em>Sunrise</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In Robert Jordan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, sometimes characters are barely mentioned in a book due to the ridiculously huge cast. This is at its most egregious when Mat, one-third of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerTrio">Power Trio</a>, spends a book apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenInertia">trapped under a pile of rocks</a>. (He is actually recovering off the page.)
</li><li> Kell Tainer is the main-focus character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/XWingSeries">Wraith Squadron</a></em>. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> arc finishes by the end of that novel, and the next two novels (<em>Iron Fist</em> and <em>Solo Command</em>) focus on other characters in Wraith Squadron, with Kell getting viewpoint status for maybe one section per book.

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> It's become something of a standard rule in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomCom">Dom Coms</a> that the protagonist couple have three children (see <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomeImprovement">Home Improvement</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNanny">The Nanny</a></em>, etc.) as a quick and easy way to have a childhood's worth of plot lines very quickly (the oldest has teen problems, such as dating and driving, the middle child has kid problems, such as first day of school, and the youngest gets to sit there and either look cute, or get an occasional one-liner.) Often, the youngest of the three children will have to go out of focus, usually because very young kids simply can't act that well and are subject to stricter child labor laws. D.J. from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em> and Jake from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba">Reba</a></em> are two notable examples.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyMatters">Family Matters</a></em>, on the other hand, the youngest child (Judy Winslow) went <em>so</em> far out of focus that she actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">disappeared</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld">Boy Meets World</a></em>, the youngest Matthews sibling goes out of focus and then disappears completely, but she shows up half a season later, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">a different actress.</a> Lampshaded when the new actress' first line in the show is "That's the longest time-out I've ever had!"

<ul><li> The first most notable case is for former President David Palmer and Michelle Dessler. Both characters are highly prominent at first, but in the fourth season neither even shows up until halfway through the season. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then they are both killed off at the very beginning of season five.</span>
</li><li> Tony actually averts it in the fourth season as he likewise isn't there at the beginning but returns fairly early on. Season five plays things frustratingly straight for him. He winds up being in a coma offscreen for the most of it, then after only a few episodes after waking up gets killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">in a rather unsatisfying manner</a>. The fans were <em>pissed</em> at this treatment, and the outcry got so high the death was controversially retconned much later.
</li><li> Curtis has a fairly large role in season four and the first half of season five, but continues to disappear in the second half, even disappearing right before the finale. He returns in the first few episodes of season six <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but then gets rather quickly killed off</span>.
</li><li> Chloe is often absent for much of the seventh season despite being the most important character after Jack by that point. In this case, it's due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">real life events</a>, namely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourPregnancy">actress Mary Lynn Rajskub's real life pregnancy</a>. Since the show couldn't naturally portray this what with only taking place over a single day, this left her not doing much aside from being shown working at a desk, and not long into it she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheFinale">She does return for the final few episodes though</a>.
</li><li> Surprisingly <em>Jack</em> of all people went through this in season seven as well. He winds up getting infected with a nerve agent which leaves him heavily sidelined and unable to join in on the action. He still appears in every episode, but doesn't really do much aside from getting sicker with each appearance. Probably the biggest acknowledgement of this are the show's recaps at the beginning of each episode, which for the first time in its history don't explicitly feature him.
</li><li> President Allison Taylor is notably absent for a good chunk of the middle of the eighth season, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the writers flat out admitted</a> it's because they didn't really know what to do with her at this point. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then she gets back into focus in a big way in the last quarter when she is forced to make a decision that compromises her morals, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">allying up</a> with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> as a result.</span>
</li><li> Season 8 also brings in John Boyd as Arlo Glass, ostensibly a main character, as well. However, he never really gets a sizable subplot to deal with. Aside from some minor flirting with Dana at the start of the season, he remains a back-up CTU analyst who does little to serve the plot. He has comparatively minimal dialogue and most of his actions are things (mostly hacking and computer usage) that Chloe likely could have managed herself. Despite this, he is one of only four characters to appear in every episode of the season (the others being Jack, Chloe, and Cole), and the last line of the <em>show</em> (up to that point) is an order that Chloe <em>directly gives him</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeverlyHills90210">90210</a></em>, Navid, in theory one of the main characters and appearing in the opening credits, barely appears in the first eight episodes and after the pilot has no plot of consequence for a third of the season. Ironically this only changed when his character was tied in with a <em>guest</em> character who had been far more visible and important (she was promoted to the credits soon after and they are now the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>).
</li><li> Particularly bad on the first few legs of each season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>, when some teams can go entire episodes getting only one or two lines, though these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat">usually</a> teams who last late into the race and get their airtime later.
<ul><li> Brennan from Season 1 is almost never shown talking in the interview segments; all the talking comes from his partner Rob. He later explained in an interview that this is probably due to his tendency to ramble on compared to his partner's terser, and hence more editing-friendly, talking.
</li><li> Derek gets pushed into the background in Season 3's later episodes in favor of his brother's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a> with Flo &amp; Zach.
</li><li> Uchenna &amp; Joyce won Season 7, but don't get major airtime until leg 8, and they are pushed back into the background for most of <em>All-Stars</em>.
</li><li> Fellow winners Kisha &amp; Jen get lost behind all the big personalities in Unfinished Business, and only get snippets of airtime prior to the last four legs.
</li><li> Jeremy &amp; Sandy (Season 19) finish in second, but don't get much screen time until one of the late legs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>: In Season Five, Andy Hallett (Lorne) probably spent more time in the makeup chair than he did in front of the camera. On the upside, Lorne does get his own episode and is featured in the final stretch.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>: After Season 1, the only way you'd know Laurel Lance is the alleged female lead of the show is her second billing in the credits. Season 2 pushes her into the background with a disconnected alcoholism arc that boils down to a weekly drunken scene or missing episodes completely, while the show focuses on the crime-fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">Oliver/Diggle/Felicity</a> trio and later Laurel's sister Sara. (Despite Sara being billed as a guest star.) In Season 3, although Laurel finally knows Oliver's secret identity, her "Black Canary arc" is relegated to a few episodes in the middle of the season and she's rarely present for any of the big team moments. By Season 4, she's basically background furniture and backup in fight scenes, so you see more of the stunt double than the actress. Her demotion is largely due to the audience's negative reaction to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselScrappy">her character</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Laurel/Oliver relationship</a> in Season 1 and a shift from the destiny, comic mythology approach to focus on more popular, original characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Felicity</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakOutCharacter">Diggle</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedExtra">Sara.</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> By the end of Season 4 the writers seem to have realized how superfluous she's become to Oliver's story and kill her off.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BarneyMiller">Barney Miller</a></em> was originally intended to shift between the title character's job at the police precinct and his life at home with his wife, Liz, and their two kids. The kids disappeared after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">pilot</a> episode, while Liz was eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">moved offscreen</a> save for a couple of guest appearances.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Simon (Number Four) and Doral (Number Five) model Cylons are hardly seen, and certainly have far less character development than the other models. Arguably, the Fours are never prominent outside one episode, but the Fives have a fair amount of screen time in the first year of the show.
</li><li> And then there's D'Anna, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> opts to stay behind on Earth after everyone else leaves</span>, and Leoben, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> sort of freaks out when Starbuck finds her own body and is then never seen again (except for a brief appearance in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>), despite vast hints earlier on that he'll be a fairly central and important player</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BetterCallSaul">Better Call Saul</a></em>, the prequel/spinoff to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>, is essentially about Jimmy McGill's descent into Saul Goodman. That said, this trope does take place:
<ul><li> One episode of season 1, "Five-O", is dedicated exclusively to Mike's backstory. Jimmy only appears in one long scene.
</li><li> In season 2, this happens to Howard Hamlin to some extent since he doesn't have as many interactions with Jimmy, having more with Kim or with Chuck.
</li><li> "Bali Ha'i" noticeably puts a lot more focus between Kim's and Mike's plot arcs than on Jimmy's plot.
</li></ul></li><li> With the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> having a choke-hold over the 13th season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BigBrother">Big Brother</a></em> US, Porsche, Adam, and Lawon have had this. Posts on Jokers Updates have even been talking about most of the newbies (Especially Porsche and Lawon) only to have numerous responses of, "Who?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>, Walt Jr. becomes gradually less and less important over the series run, probably because of R.J. Mitte's growing up over the show's five years while the show itself only takes place over two years. Considering that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the last two episodes are about 8-10 months after all of the others, thus meaning the bulk of the show is in a period of time less than a year and a half</span>, his aging wouldn't make sense at all.
</li><li> Several characters in Season 7 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> suffer from this, Xander probably getting the worst of it, but Giles, Anya, Dawn, and to a lesser extent Willow are all massively pushed to the sidelines in order to accommodate more storylines for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spike</a>. Although Giles' reduced screentime is more due to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyStewartHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyStewartHead">Anthony Stewart Head</a> moved back to England to spend more time with his family.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Casualty">Casualty</a></em> had this happen to many characters over the years, by virtue of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">Long Runner</a>, but recently, it is more due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a>:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/models/Sam_Grey/">Sam Grey<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who played <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">Scouser</a> Alice Chantrey went from main character to appearing now and then due to modelling commitments. She remained plot-relevant, but became harder to write about as her alternate career began.
</li><li> Charlie Fairhead, at one point the protagonist, swings between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a>, this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">Character Focus</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Spoofed on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>, where one episode features an Abed subplot of befriending a pregnant classmate relegated to the background. In some scenes, Abed's plotline is shown onscreen, but literally out of focus. Later in the season, when Abed mentions that he helped to deliver a baby earlier in the year, and one of his classmates asks where they were for this, he replies that they were probably off in the background somewhere. An earlier episode has Abed mention that while his "gimmick" is meta-humor, they had leaned on it pretty hard the previous week, and he resolves to "lay low for an episode." He then spends the episode as the only one of the main characters without a plotline.
</li><li> Compared to her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> supervisor counterparts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSIMiami">Horatio Caine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY">Mac Taylor</a>, Catherine Willows from the mothership suffers from this, in favor of the Ray Langston Show. Of course, if you're going to shell out the money for Lawrence Fishburne, you're going to end up using Lawrence Fishburne.
</li><li> This happened to Dawson on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DawsonsCreek">Dawson's Creek</a></em> due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Joey and Pacey</a> getting more focus. In fact, Joey is the <em>only</em> character to appear in every single episode, despite the show being named after Dawson.
</li><li> Happens a lot on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Degrassi">Degrassi</a></em> due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>. They often use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourLinesAllWaiting">Four Lines, All Waiting</a> structure.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em>, a running story line is that Debra is overwhelmed by taking care of the three children, who are nonetheless offscreen most of the time. As Ray whispers to the camera in the early season title sequence, "It's not really about the kids."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em> does this to Ross's ex-wife and son, with Ben disappearing after season 8, Carol after season 7, and Susan (Carol's wife) after season 6.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Bran doesn't appear at all in Season 5, freeing the writers up to focus more on the ever-more spread out other storylines while avoiding doing repetitive scenes of him being instructed by the Three-Eyed Raven.
</li><li> Bronn in Season 3. Even moreso in Season 6, where he doesn't appear until the seventh episode of the season. In Season 7, it takes him nearly 3 full episodes (almost half that season) and he doesn't have a line at first. This is likely because of the dislike between Jerome Flynn and Lena Headey. Seeing as they refuse to share screentime this means that Bronn only can appear when Tyrion or Jaime are at or going to a fight.
</li><li> In Season 5, Varys is largely absent after the first three episodes due to losing track of Tyrion. He catches up with him in the finale, though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em> has Tina Cohen Chang, who while she had a large, dedicated fanbase, is lucky if she gets 1 line per episode in season 2 and 3.
<ul><li> In-universe: Tina ends up losing it and gets angry with everyone. Afterwards, she has more lines and complains when she isn't being focused on.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens to Potsie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> after Richie and Ralph left the show. Most of Potsie's post-Richie/Ralph appearances are simply as a singer of the house band for Arnold's.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Homeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Homeland">Homeland</a></em> premiered with the premise focusing on the returning POW Nicholas Brody, with Carrie Mathison trying to uncover whether he's become a turncoat. However, by season 3, Brody's story fades out of focus and attention shifts to the further adventures of Carrie and her mentor Saul Berenson. The show effectively became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FranchiseZombie">Franchise Zombie</a> once the Brody story petered out and the creators wanted to continue with the characters they still had.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KamenRider">Kamen Rider</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Kamen Rider Den-O</a></em> does it to its own main character, Ryotaro, as time goes on. This is presumably due to a combination of the Imaging <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">stealing the spotlight</a> and Takeru Satoh, Ryotaro's original actor, leaving the franchise to pursue other roles after the third (and supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>) movie. The character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNthDoctor">Nth Doctor'd</a> for his next few appearances, but doesn't show up at all in the <em>Kamen Rider</em> 40th anniversary movie. The real nail in the coffin is the usage of Den-O's two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Modes</a>: Liner Form, which comes with and represents Ryotaro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> but gets used less and less while Climax Form, which is an excuse for the Imagin to act goofy, gets used more and more.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDouble">Kamen Rider Double</a></em> has done this post-series to half of the title character. Renn Kiriyama, a proud <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">Promoted Fanboy</a>, has been willing to reprise his role several times since the show ended, while Masaki Suda (like Takeru Satoh) moved on to other projects and hasn't come back since 2011's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KamenRiderXKamenRiderFourzeAndOOOMovieWarMegaMax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KamenRiderXKamenRiderFourzeAndOOOMovieWarMegaMax">Kamen Rider × Kamen Rider Fourze &amp; OOO: Movie War Mega Max</a></em>. As a result, Shotaro has appeared in several post-series crossovers but all you'll ever get out of Philip anymore is recycled audio clips.
</li></ul></li><li> Kyra Rockmore, Kenan's sister in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel">Kenan &amp; Kel</a></em>. After Season 2, she rarely ever appears in the show. She doesn't even appear in episodes with the rest of her family or The Chicago Witch Trials episode which would have been a perfect opportunity to bring up her crush on Kel. She does, however, appear in the series finale movie as well as the graduation episode.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>, this has happened to every main character that does not have the title detective in front of their name.
<ul><li> Dr. Warner and Dr. Huang were never really in focus and have always missed several episodes a season.
</li><li> Sergeant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch">John Munch</a> went out of focus around season nine when he got promoted to his current position and is appearing less than the doctors.
</li><li> As of season 12, Captain Cragen has also gone out of focus.
</li><li> This becomes really noticeable when one of the three remaining characters takes time off like in "Reparations" when only two of the seven cast members appeared.
</li></ul></li><li> Given its large ensemble cast, this easily happens on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>.
<ul><li> The worst-off character is unquestionably Claire, who's only had three episodes in the limelight. This is particularly frustrating, especially in the final season when her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> reappearance after a season long absence</span> seems like a good set up for a terrific flashback episode that never really happens and the hold situation is instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Handwave">handwaved</a> away magically.
</li><li> Still better off than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Libby</span>, who gets no limelight episodes before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">getting crushed by a bridge</a>.
</li><li> Ilana is the same in the sixth season.
</li><li> Jin and Sun get a pretty bad case of this in several seasons. In the first season they both appear in most of the episodes and get their own centric episodes, but after that all of their centrics get lumped together as one and their role in the plot diminishes considerably. For starters, in season 3 they both disappear for about six episodes in a row and have no dialogue in several others. Its also around this time that they start to just sort of follow other characters around for want of something to do, other than the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">Character Focus</a>. Luckily, they both get some decent character development in seasons 4 and 6, which keeps them from being completely useless.
</li><li> All 3 non Daniel Faraday freighters after season 4. Charlotte never got much love for the writers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and then she dies.</span> Miles pretty much just becomes a two man comedy team with Hurley and doesn't get a season 6 centric episode. Season 5 sets Lapidus up as important, with Bram thinking he may be a candidate he becomes a regular and then goes out of focus with the candidate story shifting focus to other characters with nary a mention of Frank. Poor guy doesn't even get flash sideways cameo and is basically just comic relief. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Until the finale when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">unceremonious death</a> turns out to be a subversion and he successfully gets the survivors off the island.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Knights of the Round Table in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin (2008)</a></em> fall prey to this trope. Though they were given significant attention in their introductory episodes (in fact, both Lancelot and Gwaine are introduced in episodes that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTitle">named after them</a>), once they were established characters the writers seemingly ran out of ideas over what to do with them. Two were actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/McLeaned">McLeaned</a> when the actors decided they had better prospects elsewhere, and the remaining ones were given virtually nothing to do but jump into a fight scene every now and then.
</li><li> This also happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ModernFamily">Modern Family</a></em>, partly due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor">the legal limitations on the younger actors' work time</a>. But during the first half of the second season, some of the adult characters barely made appearances in episodes that focused on one of the three households almost exclusively.
</li><li> Season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> has several examples:
<ul><li> Fozzie, who had a strong presence on the show both onstage and behind the scenes, is entirely absent from several episodes, and when he does appear, it is usually for only one scene either silently as part of a group shot or headlining a single act/song onstage.
</li><li> Statler and Waldorf's appearances become limited as most episodes cut to them only once or twice throughout (not counting their ending tag) when earlier seasons would typically have them share a comment after every performance.
</li></ul></li><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em> Ducky's assistant Jimmy Palmer appears in the opening credits and occasionally trailers, but you could be forgiven for not even having a clue who he is. Especially after he starts planning his wedding Palmer rarely even appears in most episodes, he'll only appear for a couple minutes at the most unless the episode focuses around him and he'll share that time with Ducky every time. He also doesn't do anything of use and just makes some painfully awkward attempts at small talk until somebody shuts him up.
</li><li> Ryan was always listed as a main character in the credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office (US)</a></em>, but he almost never has a plot of consequence. Andy is clearly the <em>de facto</em> most prominent character after the main four, and Ryan lags behind most of the supposedly secondary cast. <br/><br/>Ryan had a get-out-of-jail-free card, because the actor who played him also happened to be one of the executive producers of the show. Well, he was a writer who got promoted to executive producer. It isn't like he pitched a hissy fit.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is a long list of characters that start off relevant and then get relegated to cameos and small appearances every once in a while. Examples include Granny, Red, Archie and the Seven Dwarfs. Several others disappear altogether though in their defence they are mostly relevant to one arc.
</li><li> Henry becomes this starting from Season 3 where he is used more as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin">Living MacGuffin</a> for the first half and practically vanishes for the second half until the very end. He does not regain the kind of relevance he had in the first two seasons until the season 4 finale.
</li><li> Henry gets off lightly compared to Will Scarlet/The Knave of Hearts. Despite been a main cast member his role in episodes is mainly that of a recurring guest with his biggest reason for been around (been from the spin off) is ignored except for two brief mentions.
</li><li> Season 5 seems to be set out to avert this with the first episode having Grumpy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">give a passionate speech about how he is tired of waiting around on the side lines</a> and he and the dwarfs join the main cast in the latest adventure accompanied by Granny and Belle. The second episode puts these characters to use and Henry gains a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> of his own making sure he gets more importance than last season.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Parenthood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Parenthood">Parenthood</a></em> has mild examples as many characters (especially the children) simply do not exist - and are never mentioned - in episodes that do not focus on them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceCameraAction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceCameraAction">Police, Camera, Action!</a></em>, although a documentary series, had contributions from a number of police forces, but these went out of focus by certain series:
<ul><li> After the 1998 series, Rigspolitiet Denmark (the national Danish police) appears less and less, with a cameo in <em>Nowhere to Hide</em>.
</li><li> Same for Leo De Haas Produkties B.V. who supplied footage from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNetherlands">The Netherlands</a> between 1995 and 1998. However, they have cameo appearances in the 1999 and 2000 series.
</li><li> By 2007, neither foreign force appeared in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReTool">Retool</a>.
</li><li> Also, the Surrey and Hampshire Police footage is less often used after 1998, leaving just Metropolitan Police, Lancashire Constabulary, Lincolnshire Police, Los Angeles News Service and Police Service of Northern Ireland as the main contributors.

Even Madison herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> her own lack of focus. Among other reasons, it could be that Nick was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">taking up all the airtime</a> that year. A lampshade was hung on this at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanConvention">Power Morphicon</a>, when Nick and Maddie's actors mentioned he continually lobbied to get Madison a bigger role on the series. This finally led to an incredibly awkward "come back for me" moment in the season finale after they'd spent almost no time interacting all season. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealitySubtext">The fact their actors happened to be a couple</a> didn't hurt...

Since the showrunners were kind of stuck with him thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>, they resorted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeShemp">Fake Shemping</a> and cut his presence down to the occasional token appearance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLostGalaxy">Power Rangers Lost Galaxy</a></em>, Leo's brother Mike is built up to be a fairly important character, even being the one to pull the Quasar Saber from the rock. However, he's absent from the series after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he falls into a crevice, presumed dead. Eventually, it turns out the Magna Defender was at the bottom of that same crevice, and saved Mike by fusing his spirit with his.

It's jarring in Season 5, where there are a bunch of scenes set in PQL's waiting room, but Beeks isn't in any one of them. This is subtly lampshaded (but ultimately played straight) in Season 5's "Return of the Evil Leaper," where she is talked about, and leapee Arnold Watkins mistakes Al's handlink for her — but it's <em>Al</em> who does some armchair psychology with Arnold, not Beeks.
</li><li> Despite being billed as a regular in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riverdale">Riverdale</a></em> Josie McCoy has appeared less than most of the supporting cast.

</li><li> Comes up in the 8th season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> due to budget cuts; every member of the main cast is out of focus for at least one episode.

</li><li> They did this <em>accidentally</em> for 6 seasons with Lt. Carey, before suddenly realizing in the final season that they had forgotten he was still alive, and then bringing him back for one more episode.

</li><li> For a show with only two leads, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> occasionally has episodes that give one brother far more focus than the other, though this often is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">Real Life Writes the Plot</a> when one or the other actor has limited availability. Notable examples include Season 2's "No Exit," when Sam is largely kept in the background as Jared Padalecki needed medical treatment for his broken arm, and Season 9's "Mother's Little Helper," when Jensen Ackles needed some time off, thus giving Dean a relatively small personal plot (albeit very connected to the larger mytharc) while Sam handles the actual hunt that week.

</li><li> Other than Shambo and Russell Swan, the Galu tribe in <em>Samoa</em> is out of focus, as well as Mick in the Foa Foa tribe. You can actually cut out <em>every</em> shot of the Galu Tribe with the exception of Russell Swan being evacuated and you won't miss anything important - heck you probably won't even change the length of the episode.
</li><li> A few people in <em>Tocantins</em>, when the camera isn't focused on Coach.

These range from explaining what she's doing at that point in time (such as moving to Canada), to her past in Point Place (such as who her godparents are). Laurie's last screen reference is in the finale, where Kitty, after stating heartfelt reasons why she loves everyone in the room, including telling Donna that she loves her like a daughter, asks "Speaking of daughters... has anyone seen Laurie?" prompting a long laugh from the studio audience.

Although Williams is a main contracted actor, she's actually not in very many episodes, and her character Leena has little screen time in episodes she is in, and has little impact on the plot. Leena isn't even acknowledged in series promos that supposedly highlight all the main characters. Williams is also absent from the new intro sequence.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Pro Wrestling </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is what led up to the death of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>. There were so many contributing factors to why WCW died, none of which should have happened. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a> had a seven million dollar contract that gave him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">complete creative control</a>. There were over 140 guys on the roster, most of whom never got used — yet they still bought plane tickets to fly them to shows (for the sake of comparison, WWE's current roster of male wrestlers currently sits at 65; their team, including Divas, commentators, announcers, referees and valets, might barely break 100.) Executives from Turner Broadcasting couldn't handle the backstage politics, and the bookers they hired were happy to put themselves over at the expense of the company. <br/><br/>The number of wrestlers on the roster had gotten to around 265 when the decision was made to cut costs. About 200 wrestlers were fired. Before the cuts, the roster included Lanny Poffo and Kevin "Nailz" Wacholz. Poffo was hired as a favor to his brother (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy Savage</a>) in 1995 and never worked a match for the company. Wacholz worked one match for the company in 1993 (as "The Prisoner" at the first Slamboreee) and signed a contract, but everyone forgot about him, so he was never pink slipped and his contract rolled over until someone realized he was paid to do nothing for 7 years and he was released. Going back even earlier, The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HonkyTonkMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HonkyTonkMan">Honky Tonk Man</a> was working for WCW without a contract (which in WCW usually paid a weekly salary instead of per appearance), he would sign in at each TV taping. After he quit, he asked a friend to keep signing in for him so he could keep getting paid. It worked for a few months until they were caught. It's believed that there were many, many other screw-ups where wrestlers were forgotten about and paid for doing nothing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMLL">CMLL</a>'s Mini-Estrella and Women's divisions aren't included on the <em>Fantasticamania</em> cards since co producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> has nothing comparable to them. They don't compete in CMLL's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TournamentArc">Universal Championship</a> either.
</li><li> Very common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>. A new wrestler will be introduced to much fanfare or will even be quite successful. Usually seeing their greatest success for as few as six weeks or, iff lucky, as many a six months. They start off winning on the main shows. Gradually, they start losing more than winning. Then they are only seen on lesser shows like <em>Superstars</em> and <em>Main Event</em>. Finally the company will be wishing them "good luck on their future endeavors." In between, you're bound to catch a glimpse of them once in a while: participating (fleetingly) in a Battle Royal, looking on from the middle distance as something happens backstage, or standing underneath the TitanTron with the rest of the cast to commemorate a recently deceased wrestler or national tragedy. Let's look at some of them in more detail.
<ul><li> The Highlanders are hot stuff, until creative got tire of them and introduced Cryme Tyme as the new hot stuff, until creative got tire of them and introduced a bunch of second generation wrestlers as hotstuff, until creative got tire of them and made them lackeys of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. This allowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDibiaseJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDibiaseJr">two</a> second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">generation</a> wrestlers a second chance to get hot again before someone else inevitably became the focus. Most wrestlers don't get that much.
</li><li> Apollo Crews on <em>Raw</em>. Despite being undeniably gifted athletically, he's struggled even to remain on the midcard, even as the crown jewel of Titus O'Neil's "Titus Worldwide" stable (which itself has not been featured prominently). It's likely that WWE sees him as nothing more than a bland babyface, since he doesn't seem to possess a gimmick of any kind, let alone an entertaining one.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyGunn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyGunn">Billy Gunn</a>. Ever notice how unsuccessful he was outside of the tag team division? He may have shone as one of the New Age Outlaws and as Chuck Palumbo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> partner, but solo he was little more than "Mr. Ass," whose gimmick was that he loved women's butts. Not much that can be done with that gimmick without offending many people, so Gunn faded into the background and only occasionally appeared on the midcard.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BoDallas">Bo Dallas</a> made a splash in early 2013 while still a part of the NXT roster, entering the Royal Rumble Match as an extrabrand participant and eliminating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WadeBarrett">Wade Barrett</a>. After that, however, he was sidelined for a long time. He kept bouncing from one heel gimmick to another; these included a motivational speaker ("BO-lieve"), a political candidate ("BO-lieve in Bo"), and one of the four Social Outcasts (and arguably the most insignificant of the quartet at that). Then he finally gained some notoriety as a prominent member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheMiz">Miz's</a> "Miztourage," and even made it to main-event level on television (if only by association). But he soon started to fade from the scene again, partly because both members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheBar">The Bar</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ClaudioCastagnoli">Cesaro</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sheamus">Sheamus</a>) took over the roles of Miz's main henchmen and partly because the Miz himself vanished in order to shoot another <em>Marine</em> sequel.

<ul><li> A similar variant happens in Pen and Paper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGame">RPGs</a>. While this can easily happen in when a player is absent for too long or doesn't speak up enough, it also happens when a group is well-established and a newcomer happens to join. The group starts to act like the other person is not there, and as a result their character acts out of focus. This sometimes drives away newcomers, and discourages other people who have an interest in the game but have nobody to play with because the local group(s) are iron-bound.
</li><li> Often happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a> Fantasy</em>, the Dogs of War have been shelved for being game breakers.

<ul><li> For how most of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> games since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat3Electrosphere">Electrosphere</a></em> have essentially been prequels showing how the world got to the point it was in that game, very little focus has been given to anyone involved in that game's conflict other than General Resource, one of the two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega Corps</a> engaging in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporateWarfare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorporateWarfare">Corporate Warfare</a>. They ended up getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat5TheUnsungWar">two whole</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar">games</a> explaining how they started out as the South Belka Munitions Factory and then became North Osea Gründer Industries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAdvance">another game</a> in which they tried (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">ultimately succeeded</a>) in taking over the remaining independent republics, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAssaultHorizonLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatAssaultHorizonLegacy">a remake</a> showing how they were responsible for the A.I.-controlled ADF-01 FALKEN. Neucom Inc.? Exactly one namedrop, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">not even in any of the games</a>, about how they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat04ShatteredSkies">the Erusea Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> until after the Usean Continental War.
</li><li> Probably the most extreme example is Eiji Kisaragi. He burst onto <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArtOfFighting">Art of Fighting</a> 2</em> as a mysterious stranger with a tenuous connection to Ryo Sakazaki, and it's strongly hinted that he's going to be a major player for years to come. In SNK's <em>very next</em> fighting game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a> '95</em>, he's reduced to a bit player who gets bushwhacked by Iori Yagami. Then in <em>Art of Fighting 3</em>, he's mentioned all over the place (largely in connection with exile Jin Fu-Ha) but not seen even once. And that's the last we see or hear of him for nearly a <em>decade</em>, finally resurfacing in <em>KOF XI</em> (where he's a bit player in a throwaway joke plot).
</li><li> Rebecca Crane, long-serving <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AssassinsCreed">Assassin's Creed</a></em> modern day character, doesn't appear at all in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity">Assassin's Creed: Unity</a></em>. No explanation is given for this in-game. It is particularly notable since her partner, Shaun Hastings, has a significant role in the story. It is also somewhat ironic as a character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRogue">Assassin's Creed: Rogue</a></em>, which released on the same day as <em>Unity</em>, states that Shaun and Rebecca are inseparable. Apparently not.
</li><li> Eddie and Shift get hit with this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BoxxyQuestTheGatheringStorm">BoxxyQuest: The Gathering Storm</a></em>. Unlike Catie, Anon, Til, and Tyalie, who continue to get screentime and character development throughout the game, Eddie and Shift are basically forgotten about after their respective arcs. They still show up for cutscenes, of course, but they dont have as many lines as the others, and their support conversations are noticeably shorter and less detailed. For Eddie, its somewhat mitigated by his strength in battle, which means youll be using him quite a lot, but Shift is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> who doesnt even get that.
</li><li> Maderas and Hoggmeiser don't get any lines after they've been defeated and joined your party in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Disgaea">Disgaea</a></em>. They're not even shown in cutscenes.
</li><li> The Darkspawn get hit with this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>. This, however, makes sense: the coming of a new Darkspawn Blight was the major event of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, but the second and third games are focused on other issues and the Darkspawn aren't swarming to the surface <em>en masse</em> again, so they're not nearly as big a threat.
</li><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> games have this, except the characters other than the main three (hero, lancer, and love interest) tend to drop in and out of focus. List of examples follows:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> is the first one to give characters distinct classes and characterisations. Though Cecil's always in the party, the other members rotate with the plot momentum and thus do get some relevance to the story after they initially join.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> has issues for each character, but seeing as the party only changes once, everyone stays in focus.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> juggled its ensemble cast relatively well in the first half of the game, with Terra and Locke acting as the <em>de facto</em> main characters. After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a></span> when the party members are scattered and must be re-gathered, Celes takes over main character duties, several minor characters are given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>, and Terra and Locke are almost forgotten about due to (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">usually</a>) being the final two to rejoin the party. The former at least gets a couple cameos. The latter is simply absent, and isn't given much to do after he comes back either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> has Cloud's struggle as the game's focus, but the other non-optional characters get several mandatory sections that feature them heavily, and one of the optional ones (Yuffie) has a lengthy side-quest focusing on her. The only real exception would be Red XIII. He's introduced as a rare species that Hojo is fascinated with. After that he is completely dropped from all things plot-important until Cosmo Canyon gives him his time in the sun. After <em>that</em>, he becomes all but irrelevant until the very ending cutscenes, as even scenes including his "grandfather" Bugenhagen don't need him to say anything unless he's in the party to say one single line of dialogue for showing up. Apparently he'd had an extensive arc plotted out for him early in development, but all of it is dropped apart from a couple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxshadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxshadow">Fauxshadowing</a> lines that had been left over from an earlier draft of the script.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> has little time for people who aren't Squall or Rinoa, and tries to make up for this with the odd time that the whole party has to tackle a crisis and giving the characters various other roles. Selphie becomes the final airship pilot, Zell is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MrExposition">Mr. Exposition</a>, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> is the best about this for the most part. Except for Quina, who is just there for comic relief, and Freya, who... well, after Disc 1 she just stands around and looks like a rat. But the ATE system lets other characters get scenes when they aren't with you, or even on different continents!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> is somewhat mixed about it. The power trio of Tidus, Auron and Yuna still gets all the action, but Wakka and Rikku get decent time. Lulu, however, is largely there to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBreak">provide exposition on locations and people's actions/motives</a>, with her connections to the other characters and story elements only occasionally being brought up. The only real time she takes centre stage is during a sidequest that explains a particular part of her backstory. Albeit, a sidequest dedicated to powering up <em>Yuna</em>. Kimahri isn't relevant till 3/4 through the game, either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> inverts the usual way this happens: instead of the hero and his girlfriend being the main characters, everyone else in the party (except for Fran) gets all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterFocus">Character Focus</a> while Vaan's role is to exist as a way for them to reflect on and work through their problems. Penelo (said girlfriend) also seems shoehorned in so there could be a sixth character, as well as a natural mage character, though she does have a small amount of plot importance: in addition to serving as Ashe's "conscience" alongside Vaan, her friendship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWisePrince">Larsa</a> makes him (more) sympathetic to the misfortunes suffered by Dalmasca.
</li><li> This is reversed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings">Revenant Wings</a></em> where Vaan becomes not only the main character but the savior of the world, to the point where many of the other characters become window dressing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> shifts perspectives a lot, so characters go in and out of focus. It can be said, though, that all of them are pretty well-developed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> has characters who may have been active in the plot while they were guests, but once they join your party properly, they never appear in cutscenes or get mentioned again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em> takes this to the next level in regards to Lightning. During the first trailer, we are told she is the main character (playable and otherwise). Come the second trailer, and we see that she now shares the spotlight with Serah and Noel. Fast-forward to today... and while she is the only character on the box art, she only serves as the narrator and is sometimes playable for brief periods of time. Yet Motomu Toriyama still described her in the build-up to release as a "major character," "the backbone of the plot," and the "driving force of the plot". Pretty good for a mostly non-playable, barely-seen character, huh?
</li></ul></li><li> There's always lots of characters, and you can do the support conversations any time you like, but in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> game, you're lucky if you get a single line more than two missions after you're introduced, as the developers don't want to rest anything plot-significant on the shoulders of someone who might be dead by that point.
<ul><li> Later games have been getting clever about this with optional "Info" conversations, allowing a good fourth of the cast to get decent story-relevant characterization.
</li><li> Some other games also have natter between enemies they state they are out to get or know somehow. For example; Nino, Jaffar, and Renault actually have a few things to say to Nergal instead of <em>just</em> of Athos and the Lords in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Rekka</a></em>, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Path of Radiance</a></em>, Ashnard will have a conversation with any Laguz he faces and characters like Jill or Reyson.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ironically, this happened to Freddy Fazbear himself. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys1">the first game</a>, he is <em>the</em> most dangerous animatronic in the pizzeria, hiding in the darkness, coming for you when the power runs out, and jumping from the east hall straight to your office. But in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2">sequel</a>, he and his Toy counterpart are arguably the easiest animatronics to fend off (they don't come for you often, and they come for you from the hallway, meaning you don't need the camera to keep track of them). In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys3">third game</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's the first one to get dismantled by the Purple Man. There IS a Phantom Freddy, but it seems to take more after Golden Freddy than regular Freddy</span>. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys4">the fourth game</a>, he's one of the easier Nightmares to deal with, and in both <em>4</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation">Sister Location</a></em>, he doesn't even headline the main restaurant, being outshone by Fredbear and Circus Baby (respectively).
</li><li> Chica is sidelined hard compared to the other three original animatronics. She has very little significance to the overall mythos compared to the others, and she's the only one to receive no representation at all in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation">Sister Location</a></em>, while Freddy and Foxy have Funtime counterparts and Bonnie appears as a puppet on Funtime Freddy's arm.
</li></ul></li><li> This is common in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em> for being a game with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>.
<ul><li> Not everyone appear during in-game events. some are not even lucky to be casted as supporting characters, and a majority of R-rarity characters are not given enough characterization outside of their own Fate Episodes.
</li><li> Likewise, Collaboration characters are only given focus on their respective events.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>, the Master Chief has been given less focus outside of the main games since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo3">Halo 3</a></em>, with the writers focusing more on expanding the rest of the universe.
</li><li> Two noteworthy examples from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> series:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer">Riku</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">Kairi</a>, who both played major roles in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">the original game</a>, don't really do anything of high importance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> until the very last world, despite still being technically main characters. Riku has since become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deuteragonist">Deuteragonist</a> of the series, but Kairi has remained out of focus for the rest of the franchise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">further breaking the base on a subject</a>.
</li><li> Donald Duck and Goofy were Sora's constant companions in <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</a></em>, and <em>Kingdom Hearts II</em>. After that, they've fallen by the wayside. They only had brief cameos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Birth by Sleep</a></em>, were just unlockable multiplayer mode characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2">358/2 Days</a></em>, and their biggest role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsCoded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsCoded">coded</a></em> is reminding Data Sora about what they and the <em>real</em> Sora did together in the past. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts3DDreamDropDistance">3D</a></em>, "dream" versions of them appear in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyDonaldGoofyTheThreeMusketeers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyDonaldGoofyTheThreeMusketeers">Three Musketeers</a></em>-based world, but the real versions of them don't do much <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment near the end of the game</span>. Only as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> are they adventuring with Sora again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <em>Left 4 Dead</em> DLC expansion <em>Crash Course</em>, Bill has no new lines, and uses earlier lines when they aren't quite appropriate. This is because his voice actor, Jim French, was busy with his other jobs and Valve couldn't get in touch with him in time to record lines. This eventually lead to Bill being unceremoniously killed off before the events of <em>The Passing</em>, the DLC that brings together the two games' playable characters. Once Jim French was available again, however, the next DLC starring the original Survivors and its accompanying comic put most of the focus on Bill.
</li><li> Rochelle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> has lots of interesting lines, but the game usually focuses on the other 3 survivors when it's time for someone to talk, thus most people never get to hear Rochelle say anything interesting or even talk at all. This unintentionally makes Rochelle's character bland and generic, which many people hate her for but hardly understand why she is this way.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfDragoon">Legend of Dragoon</a></em> has a large cast of nine playable characters <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(only seven at a time, as one gets killed and the other sidelined)</span>, but the party members that join later in the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Kongol</a> and the princess Miranda, have significantly less time devoted to their character development. Miranda is only given one scene of dialogue in the Kashua Glacier with Meru, while Kongol only gets a scene at the Home of the Giganto. To top it off, their scenes on the Moon That Never Sets are significantly briefer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> has actually often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted this trope</a> in regards to post-SNES incarnations of Zelda<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3d2yp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3d2yp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3d2yp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Examples including being a cross-dressing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">Stealth Mentor</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em> and an always-present <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlyBruiser">Girly Bruiser</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">Spirit Tracks</a></em></span>, but there are still a few legitimate examples:

</li></ul></li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioTennis">Mario Tennis</a></em> for the Nintendo 64, Birdo has been a common character in <em>Mario</em> spin-offs. However, she has been absent from many recent <em>Mario</em> spin-offs, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKart8">Mario Kart 8</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party 10</a></em>, and even <em>Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> series had numerous characters and some were given more focus than others.
<ul><li> The squad from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1">the first game</a>, minus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Garrus</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWench">Tali</a>, were sidelined into either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> territory (Liara or Wrex) or in a single cutscene (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Ashley</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">Kaidan</a>) come the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">second game</a>.
</li><li> Tali actually does hit with this to some extent in both sequels. While Garrus is recruited early on in all three games, Tali only joins forces with Shepard early on in the original. In both parts two (barring a borderline cameo) and three she does not show up until sometime through the halfway point, long after significant chunks of the story have come up.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">The third game</a> had many of the characters from the second game cut to reduced roles. While possibly justified given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">the nature of the second game</a>, Garrus, Liara and Tali return to the squad and are given large roles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Thane</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Miranda</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mordin</a> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Legion</a></span> have larger, non-squadmate related roles, but the rest serve only as cameos.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, the <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> DLC does this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Shepard</a>, as the DLC quickly becomes all about Liara and ignores everyone else, to the point where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">your other teammate is taken out by a thrown table at the beginning of the final boss fight, and is unconscious for the entire battle</span>.
</li><li> Unfortunately, even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice-heavy</a> <em>Citadel</em> DLC got hit with this. Assuming you have saved every single possible character across all three games, there are three people who cannot make an appearance due to plot developments in <em>3</em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Thane, Legion, and Mordin, who won't even show up if he survives the genophage arc due to needing to keep his survival a secret</span>. As far as other characters go, possible love interests Kelly Chambers and Diana Allers sit the events of the DLC out entirely, while Dr. Chakwas, Engineer Adams, and engineers Ken and Gabby are similarly nowhere to be found.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4wjfh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4wjfh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4wjfh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dr. Chakwas, at least, gets a mention from Samantha Traynor saying she had important business elsewhere</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em> loses focus once the plot starts picking up from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX2">the second game onward</a>. The spot that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">stolen from him</a> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Zero</a></em>. This is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">Inafune originally intended the series to be</a>, since <em>Zero is supposed to be the <strong>real</strong> main character of the </em>X<em> series</em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> that made X in the first place. This backfired a good deal with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX7">X7</a></em>, where at the start of the game, you're given Zero and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Axl</a>, with X going into a pacifistic role. <em>X7</em> isn't liked very much.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManXCommandMission">Mega Man X: Command Mission</a></em>, Massimo, Marino, and Cinnamon have introduction levels, but that's it. After that, they're just cast-filler who tag along with X, Zero, and Axl for the sake of it. Had Capcom at least given them more missions that reveal more about their backstories and personal reasons for joining X's group, Massimo, Marino, and Cinnamon would've been decent at best.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> series, this has happened to Kraid. In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Metroid1">Metroid</a></em>, Kraid is one of the main commanders of the Space Pirates alongside Ridley, and he reprises this role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>. After <em>Super</em>, Kraid practically dropped off the radar as Ridley <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutVillain">took center stage</a> more and more as Samus's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>. Kraid himself hasn't made an appearance since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidZeroMission">Zero Mission</a></em>, itself a remake of his debut game.
</li><li> Philemon, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series, hasn't made a full appearance since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em>. The save points in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> were made to look like a cloud of butterflies as a reference to Philemon's continued involvement in the overall series, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the butterfly representation was hijacked by his servant Lavenza</span>.
</li><li> This certainly happens with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>'s titular monsters. Every time a new generation of Pokémon is introduced, a lot of the Pokémon end up becoming out of focus and usually are only available to the player after they've beaten the main storyline and obtained the National Pokédex. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">Pokémon Black and White</a></em> was especially bad with this since <em>none</em> of the older Pokémon are available to the player until the National Dex upgrade is obtained, however the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">sequel</a> offered a good variety of both old and new Pokémon. The most egregious example was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, which contrary to previous mainline entries had hundreds of Pokémon not even <em>programmed in</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaterInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaterInstallmentWeirdness">totally unavailable for transfer</a>.
</li><li> The USMC in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype2">[PROTOTYPE 2]</a></em> play a much, much smaller role than they did in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prototype">the first game</a> - in fact, they aren't mentioned even once outside of the opening cutscene. They're mostly just scattered randomly throughout military bases to make less sadistic players feel bad about rampaging.
</li><li> Cham Cham in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown">Samurai Shodown</a></em>, although popular, has only appeared in a few games. Earthquake and Gen-an from the same series have the same deal.
</li><li> As of the past few years, most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast">Ensemble Cast</a> have being pushed to the side... in favor of developing new relationships between Sonic and one-shot characters such as Shahra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a></em>, Merlina and Caliburn in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicStorybookSeries">Sonic and the Black Knight</a></em>, and Chip and Professor Pickle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em>, or more recently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog4">only having Sonic and Robotnik</a>.
<ul><li> This actually happened to <em>Sonic himself</em> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2006">Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)</a> where Sonic plays the <em>least</em> relevant role of all three protagonists. He never even figures out who the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is, or what he's even planning. He's more occupied with rescuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">Princess Elise</a> repeatedly. What's especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> about this is that was the <em>franchise's 15th anniversary</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicColors">Sonic Colors</a></em> marked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonicTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SonicTeam">Sonic Team</a>'s attempt to streamline the franchise, which meant all the supporting cast had to go, leaving just Sonic, Tails and Eggman (and Orbot and Cubot as comic relief). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> brought many of the supporting cast back for minor roles, though they went away again for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicLostWorld">Sonic Lost World</a></em>, with Amy and Knuckles appearing in 2 cutscenes, but not contributing to the main plot. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em> seems to be bringing them back to playable character status.
</li></ul></li><li> The story mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em>, likely due to the outcome of the previous game's final Splatfest, gives Marie a huge amount of focus and character development, as she serves as your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> and often talks about her backstory and what she's been doing in the years between the games. So what about Callie? Well, she's mentioned often enough, gets a few Sea Scrolls to herself, still has a bit of dialogue after most of the boss battles, and finding her serves as Marie's primary motivation for recruiting the player in the first place, but for plot reasons she doesn't appear in person until the final boss fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">gets all of three lines as herself</a>, and disappears after the credits roll unless you decide to redo the final battle. Her only in-game appearance (indeed, the only acknowledgement of her existence) otherwise is as a sticker on Crusty Shawn's food truck. And she <em>still</em> has it better than Cap'n Cuttlefish, who gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">Written-In Absence</a> and no physical appearances at all, except in the Octo Expansion, where he's one of the main supporting characters alongside Pearl and Marina.
</li><li> Jim Raynor for a great deal of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em>'s story. He's the main character for the Terran campaign, and then only pops up occasionally with minimal impact throughout the first game and expansion's five other campaigns. Justified, since he didn't really have much manpower behind him after defecting from Mengsk. His major contribution is helping the Protoss defeat the Overmind, but he really just shows up, with no explanation of how or when he formed an alliance with Zeratul, and then leaves again. He's front and center for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em>, though, and manages to get a lot done with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">small rebel force</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Guile; being a rather popular character during the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterII">Street Fighter II</a></em>, it's rather odd that he doesn't appear for the next several years. He finally returned in the home console version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a> 3</em>, the arcade version of which features every other character from the original World Warrior except for him. <br/><br/>Guile going out of focus makes plot sense, however, as his character motivation is to avenge the death of his friend Charlie. In the <em>Alpha</em> series Charlie is still alive, and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIII">Street Fighter III</a></em> the murderer is long dead. No such excuse exists in the plotless Versus games, however, where his presence has been sorely missed since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a></em>. The games where Guile does appear — the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterEX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterEX">EX</a></em> series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em> — have Bison alive, giving him a reason to be there.
</li><li> Many of the new characters in <em>Street Fighter III</em> have yet to make an appearance outside those games. Though this is slowly being rectified, as Alex, Yun and Yang, Ibuki, Makoto, and Dudley have since made appearances in other Capcom games. Also a partial justification, as <em>SFIII</em> is currently at the end of the <em>Street Fighter</em> timeline, and some characters' stories, such as Necro, Urien, and Twelve, are based around the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, making it hard to find a good reason to put them in other <em>Street Fighter</em> games. And Alex is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the current champion of the World Warrior tournament</span>!
</li><li> Chun-Li, of all characters, got hit with this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em>, which is odd considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">she has the greatest motive to want Bison dead</a>. You only get to control as her only once in the entire story mode, contrasting the other characters who get at least 3-5 instances of play time.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em> as well as its spin-off, any of the special named characters with custom portraits who join you will <em>rarely</em> get a word of dialogue after their story arc is over. Some like Kachua, Canopus, Guildus, and Mildain play relevant parts in the story in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em> if they're still alive. However; the ending certainly doesn't forget that they joined you at all, oh <em>noo</em> - So if you kept <em>all</em> the named characters who joined you through the story alive and didn't dismiss or let anyone die, be prepared for a <em>long</em> ending! And some of these characters even join in groups, too — so as you can bet, there's a <em>LOT</em> of possible variations!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgreTheKnightOfLodis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgreTheKnightOfLodis">Knight of Lodis</a></em> has a smaller cast in general than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em>, so it's a lot easier to keep the special characters like Ivanna, Orson, Shiven, etc in focus after they joined your party. Like with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TacticsOgre">Tactics Ogre</a></em>, you get variations on the ending depending on who survives. And to a greater extent, you see more characters talking against an enemy who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">they have something personal against</a>. (Nichart and Ivanna will talk with each other) However, the optional characters like Elrik and Eupharie don't speak much after their small story arc... Elrik <em>does</em> talk with Rimmon if he's still there.
<ul><li> Orson and Shiven deserve special mention. Depending on which path you took, one will join your party, and the other will simply vanish from the storyline. If you took path A, Orson will be a boss because he's still with Rictor's Army. If you took Path B, Orson will join you because he is dismissed from Rictor's troops and Shiven will actually... vanish into the shadows until a good part into chapter three when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cybil is nearly killed by Alphonse</span> and he shows up out of almost <em>nowhere</em>, However this is actually justifiable; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Shiven is actually a ninja who was hired to spy for Cybil; he was off in the shadows</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Regal from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> is the only member of your party that you never have to use in the game. After his backstory is all wrapped up, he has very few lines throughout the rest of the game, unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">you aim to take his ending</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfGraces">Tales of Graces</a></em>, this is pretty much why everyone hates Cheria Barnes in the story. She starts off being a deconstruction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou">I Will Wait for You</a> trope but otherwise, seems only to be put in for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenRomance">Token Romance</a>.
</li><li> In a series that has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">loads and loads of popular characters</a> who make up most of the cast, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> bosses tend to be one-game wonders that don't always get seen again in the main games. If you're lucky, you get a return as a protagonist assist, another game's midboss, or if the fandom really likes you (e.g. Cirno). However, side material such as the spin-off games and manga have bigger casts and are heavier on cameos.
<ul><li> A joke goes that Sakuya Izayoi was knocked out of focus for Youmu Konpaku, and then Sanae Kochiya, as protagonists. In-series, though, Sakuya has stated very directly that she wouldn't go on incident resolution unless it directly involved the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfileCovenantOfThePlume">Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume</a></em>, every character other than Wylfred loses focus as soon as the chapter in which they're introduced concludes, unless you use the Destiny Plume on them, and they only get last words. But, if someone related to that character is around, they add a couple lines to the death scene.
</li><li> A common complaint about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a>: Cataclysm</em> was that the Alliance and its leaders got very little story and character development compared to the Horde. A few members of Blizzard's staff have even admitted they dropped the ball here, but hope to do better keeping both factions interesting in future expansions.
<ul><li> In <em>WOW</em> as a whole, the major case of this revolves around the world's factions. Blood Elves and Draenei were the sole focus of their expansion, <em>The Burning Crusade</em>, but for a time had very little to no continuation beyond the end content of that. Thankfully, this has been averted for the blood elves as of <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, and the draenei get more time in the limelight in the <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> expansion.
</li><li> <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> continues this trend with the <em>Knights of the Ebon Blade</em> (a faction of rebel death knights released from the Lich King's control) being pushed aside when <em>Cataclysm</em> arrived, despite their major focus during the fall of the Lich King, as does <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> with the Goblins and Worgen, who were introduced in <em>Cataclysm</em>.
<ul><li> The Worgen deserve special mention for being this almost from the very beginning. They are almost immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> after their starting zone is over, to the point that the actual ending of their experience has very little to do with anything else in the zone and the finale of their starter plot is played by the Horde players, as in <em>with the Worgen as the villains</em>. After this, they are shipped to Darnassus where they've pretty much been practically interchangeable with the Night Elves ever since.
</li></ul></li><li> Until <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, you would be forgiven for forgetting that the Draenei are in fact not a balancing race for the alliance so they would have an equal number of playable races to the horde. You would also be forgiven for having to look up who Prophet Velen is even if you have been playing since 2004.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em>, pretty much everyone who joins the party after Bart doesn't get much of the spotlight after the plotline where they're introduced. Rico, in particular, is given nothing unique to do after the party leaves Kislev.
</li><li> Unfortunately, it seems every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a></em> party member aside from Shion, Jr., and KOS-MOS is gradually forced out of the spotlight, especially in <em>Episode III</em>.

Has now reappeared and, shock horror, appears to even have his own story arc. It shan't last you know.
</li><li> The characters from the first three books of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, except for Agatha and Krosp, are almost entirely replaced with a new cast of characters at the start of book 4; Gil (pictured), Klaus, and their inner circles slowly weave their way back into the story over the course of book 6, and Vonn Pinn and the students return toward the end book 8, bringing the Castle Heterodyne arc into full swing.
</li><li> This is inevitable for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Polandball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Polandball">Polandball</a></em> where every country and even city or province can be a character. What makes this trope interesting in this universe is the fact that what makes a character appear often is their quirks rather than how relevant they are in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. That being said, the Polandball comics seem to favor settings in the Balkans and in the Middle East and yet this trope applies to at least one in country in both those regions.
<ul><li> For the Middle East, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain are pretty out of focus. They have no civil unrest to make for a good comic setting like Syria and Iraq do nor do they have enough human rights violations to appear as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch">Rich Bitch</a> alongside Qatar, Saudi Arabia or the UAE.
</li><li> For the Balkans, Slovenia appears the least. The Balkan comics are famous in the fandom for their colorful cast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> ethno nationalist countryballs all trying to remove each other. Slovenia is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">White Sheep</a> of the Balkans, and thus wouldn't be involved in their antics but wouldn't fit in other comics set in Europe as well.
</li><li> For the Scandinavian countries, Iceland is featured the least. His 4 brothers all have pretty distinct traits (Sweden is a politically correct gamer rivaled with Lego lover Denmark while Norway is the most "viking" of the bunch while Finland is always depressed and alcoholic) while Iceland has nothing really standing out.
</li><li> As for the rest of Europe, Luxembourg and Portugal aren't in much despite being very close to attention grabbing neighbors.
</li><li> Among Central Asia, only Kazakhstan appears a lot.

<ul><li> The character arc involving "Lord Tedd" has been rather Out of Focus, but at least a Lampshade or two has been hung. Specifically, that YES Normal Tedd's father HAS been doing things in the background.
</li><li> This has also happened to two of the eight main characters, Justin and Sarah, a good deal. Both of them are usually lucky to get to be the chorus, while all of the other principle characters usually have a storyline in progress for them; interestingly during the party Justin sort of swapped roles with Elliot, with Elliot and Sarah's main lot in things during the period of crises everyone else was having seeing the two of them make out on the couch.
</li><li> The page quote comes from an out-of-continuity <em>EGS: NP</em> strip published near the end of "Painted Black" in the main comic; an epic storyline that was mostly Grace, Eliot, Ellen and Nananse. Another lampshade about this comes later when Justin dreams that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">hobbit</a> who is specifically told he can't go on adventures; his fellow hobbits are Tedd and Susan.

<ul><li> Scott the Linux guy and his penguin Ted disappeared without a trace for several years, despite an upcoming plot point about him being announced once and several hints being dropped that they were to be part of a major storyline. In a bizarre move, fans who questioned his absence were actually <em>banned</em> from the comic's forums over it. The promised storyline <em>finally</em> came to fruition in August of 2011.
</li><li> The Chef Brian and Players strips basically vanished, though as strips featuring them are intended to be non-sequiturs (since they're, you know, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">not really important</a> to continuity), it's nowhere near as distressing as the Scott and Ted absence. The Players returned in full force after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, essentially becoming the new main characters, but Chef Brian is still a distant memory.

This trope is essentially why the creator has the "Old Familiar Faces" series every January — because he realizes a lot of characters have vanished but he <em>does</em> want readers to remember they still exist somewhere in S* P-world.

However, Bootsie and The Demon are still prone to disappear. More surprisingly, Collin, one of the two main cast members, is absent for an extended period of time in both 2005 and 2007, as the "Big Summer Storylines" — An Arc that lasts for the summer holidays — in those particular years focused on his boyfriend, Fox, and characters who had far more to do with Fox's storyline than Collin's (Fox's sister in 2005, and his workmates in 2007). When Collin is the focus of the arc, however, Fox will at least be mentioned, or given a one shot "Meanwhile..." comic to update the reader on what he's up to.

For a little while it was unclear if this was actually real, or just a drunken dream, until a later strip showing a chance encounter between him, Marten and said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBaroness">Baroness</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Torture Technician</a> seems to indicate that it wasn't.
</li><li> Raven was once one of the most prominent characters at the start, but went out of focus for months and wasn't mentioned. Her role as the other point of the barista trio had been mostly taken over by Penelope. Eventually, she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>, and shown to have left for college.
</li><li> There was quite a gap where Pintsize and Winslow went unseen, and secondary characters like Penelope and Tai went out of focus during dramatic arcs for others. They all came back later, though.
</li><li> Another <a class="urllink" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2477">strip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lampshading the non-appearance of some characters.
</li><li> It's been indicated that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChuckCunninghamSyndrome">Sara</a>, another employee at Coffee of Doom from the first few strips, may have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">eaten by an Allosaurus</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">No other theory has been presented for her absence in the comic</a>.
</li><li> Most of the original main characters have moved permanently to the background after completing a character arc or two of their own. This is especially the case with Marten, who's been a supporting character at best since the Dora breakup. Before then, the comic was originally about him and his desperate quest for a love-life. Dora and her staff at the coffee of doom only exist to provide conversation, each of them having had a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">day in the limelight</a>.

<ul><li> Inverted in an especially cruel way. For a very long time (almost 3 years), the last comic to feature the original Goblins group of Complains and company ended on a massive cliffhanger... and ever since then, the story focused roughly equally on Dies-Horribly and company and Minmax's group. Said comic was posted in January 2011.

Jade spends the majority of the comic isolated from the rest of her team in one way or another, resulting in her having less development than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatCharacter">a few of the background trolls that were only intended to be jokes.</a> The end of the comic tries to justify this with the explanation of The Ultimate Self, saying that it doesn't matter that Jade didn't get to do anything because there were alternate timelines where she did do things and those Jades somehow develop the main Jade even if she (or the audience) don't know what they did. Response to this is... mixed.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SweetBroAndHellaJeff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SweetBroAndHellaJeff">Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff</a></em>. One of the strips introduces "the new friend Geromy", who is immediately (literally—the comic he first appears in doesn't involve him at all) shoved into the background to do nothing except stand around while the title characters goof off. He doesn't even get one single line of dialogue.
</li></ul></li><li> Done intentionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Fite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Fite">Fite!</a></em>, where Gorgado's face actually replaces Guz's in the header for a while.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater">8-Bit Theater</a></em>'s latter strips, it might as well be called <em>The Black Mage and Red Mage Show, Featuring Thief</em>. Fighter often is silent (or even absent) for several strips in a row, only to pop in for one panel and spout a non-sequitur. Depending on the current story arc, said exposition is usually about magic or the elf kingdom, with the mages and Thief (an elf) trading roles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatson">The Watson</a>. Poor Fighter gets left out of pretty much all story-important conversations by necessity.
</li><li> Slick in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Sinfest">Sinfest</a></em> starting around 2011, which was amplified by the birth of one of the more notorious plot tumors (The Sisterhood sub-plot) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a> in the strip's history. Also applies to Buddha, the dragon, the zombie, and the angels after the Sisterhood appeared.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Sonichu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Sonichu">Sonichu</a></em> did this to the title character, as the author Christian Weston Chandler focused the story more on himself and demonized avatars of people who had wronged him in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> than on Sonichu himself.
</li><li> Later editions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Femmegasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Femmegasm">Femmegasm</a></em> shift away from lead characters Shelly and June in favor of Jazzy and Daisy (two dogs) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> Pembroke the dragon. However, Shelly and June come back near the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/PS238" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/PS238">PS238</a></em> has a lot of this, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">its massive cast</a>. It's particularly noticeable because some of the characters who were very prominent in early plots haven't had anything beyond a background appearance in years. Notably, every student at the school beyond Tyler and Julie, as well as all the teachers, have fallen out of focus, most after just a single story arc. Tyler's parents have also fallen out of focus (mostly as a way to show how quickly they forgot him once they had Tyler's super-powered clone Toby to serve as a substitute son).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StandStillStaySilent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StandStillStaySilent">Stand Still, Stay Silent</a></em>: Onni was the character going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall">Refusal of the Call</a> in Adventure I, and becomes the person who needs to be searched for by the other main characters in Adventure II. Both resulted in him disappearing from the story for chapters at a time.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/EquestriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/EquestriaChronicles">Equestria Chronicles</a> has this problem, occasionally.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AchievementHunter">Achievement Hunter</a> did this to a game franchise. During its early days, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em> used to be its darling, with a number of shows dedicated to it - <em>Game Night</em>, <em>Halo Fails of the Weak</em>, and <em>Achievement HORSE</em>. What happened to it?
<ul><li> First came the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> videos, especially the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterMinecraftSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterMinecraftSeries">Let's Play Minecraft</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/AchievementHunterGrandTheftAutoSeries">Let's Play Grand Theft Auto</a></em>, both of which became insanely popular.
</li><li> <em>Achievement HORSE</em> suddenly had <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Trials">Trials</a> Evolution</em> join in on the competition for quite awhile before it was reborn as <em>Achievement HUNT</em>, allowing all games to be included.
</li><li> <em>Game Night</em> suddenly stopped without warning, then returned as a livestreamed series with very little <em>Halo</em>.
</li><li> The final nail was the alteration of <em>Fails of the Weak</em>, retooling it to encompass all the best fails of the week and making it a part of the GameFails channel (which, ironically, was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">spun off</a> from <em>Fails of the Weak</em>).
</li><li> In terms of people, Caleb Denecour was this. Originally part of the main Achievement Hunter group, his speaking roles dropped significantly after an incident in <em>Let's Play Minecraft</em> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheatersNeverProsper">he cheated</a>, earning him the rage of the viewers. The guy still gets hate mail to this day because of those incidents. (The reduction to near-exclusively video editor is also because he has other priorities outside of AH and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth">its parent company</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChronoHustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChronoHustle">Chrono Hustle</a></em> ERK-147 became a main character after its introduction, but as time went on, it appeared less and less, and now it is essentially just Nikola Tesla's lab assistant, who only shows up when there is science/technology exposition to give.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VinesauceTomodachiLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VinesauceTomodachiLife">Vinesauce Tomodachi Life</a></em>, a series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">over half a hundred characters</a>, this is bound to happen. Generally, an islander will only get focused on if they've established themselves as a character (only about 15-20 islanders have) or if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TomodachiLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TomodachiLife">the game</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Vinesauce">Vinny</a> decides something interesting should happen to them. Even main characters aren't safe; Witch and Waluigi were among the first islanders added, and they were well-known for being the first (and by far the most stable) couple, but around the time they got married, they stopped being interesting and focus shifted to other islanders.
<ul><li> Of all the islanders that aren't focused on, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Lolly</a> stands out as an islander whose <em>defining character trait</em> is never being in focus. She had the unfortunate position of being added in the second half of Episode 28, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Isaac pushed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> and eliminated the first half of the day</span>, so viewers were not concerned with her at all (Dheerse was added alongside her, but her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">voice</a> made sure she had a memorable trait). She didn't do anything to establish herself, she didn't ask for much, and none of the islanders paid attention to her. Thus, Vinny never did anything with her, and she ended up being known only for this trope. Well, that and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being assimilated the episode after her birthday, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">where she finally got some screentime</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperMarioLogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SuperMarioLogan">SuperMarioLogan</a>'s videos rarely give most of the supporting cast, specifically the older characters like Woody and even Chef Pee Pee, any screen time in the recent videos ever since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Jeffy</a> was introduced in early 2016.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DragonBallZAbridged">Dragon Ball Z Abridged</a></em>.
