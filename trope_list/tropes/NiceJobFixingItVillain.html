<ul><li> In the first story arc of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">The Sandman</a></em>, the villain gets hold of the amulet containing the hero's power, and during the climactic battle (which he was winning anyway) he decides to destroy it, figuring that will leave the hero powerless and easy to defeat. Instead, destroying the amulet merely <em>releases</em> the power, which flows back into the hero, making him more powerful than he was before...
<ul><li> ...and then in an almost hilarious turn of events, Morpheus, the eponymous Sandman, completely forgives said villain, tells him that he actually did him a favour and dismisses the pitiful, Gollum-esque creature with a pat on the back. And this for a "hero" that has been fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">Disproportionate Retribution</a> in the past...

Only they end up cursing their dice, every die in their possession and every die of every friend they lent dice to, meaning the dice now produce the worst results possible, making just about anything a critical fumble. Everyone on the Knights' team was given this and they seem to be in a hopeless position as they face their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> rival team... except she reveals she learned of their "advantage" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/EBay">eBay</a>'d some of the dice, believing they were blessed and very ironically leveling the playing field.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Hulk's</a> <em>raison d'être</em>: if you're going to kill him, at least try to make him happy about it.

This gives the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralGenie">Literal Genie</a> who granted her three wishes before the option to grant "my captive flower" 3 wishes as well under the justification that she was technically now a different person in the legal sense.

No one knows exactly what happened after that, except that somehow a piano flew through the window, the steamboat exploded, and Soapy Slick ended up in jail.
</li><li> One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Loki">Loki</a>'s schemes against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a> (tricking him into fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">Hulk</a>) ended up creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a>. Considering that this superteam saved the world many, many times in Marvel Universe, this is THE Nice Job Fixing It, Villain for Loki...

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheComic">Sonic the Comic</a></em>, Sonic's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> Super Sonic was sealed in the Black Asteroid but was able to escape by charging himself up so much that he made himself into a sort of electron bomb in order to destroy the Asteroid. The explosion produced an electro-magnetic pulse that spread all over planet Mobius, which caused the totally unintentional side effect of deactivating all of Robotnik's Badniks and computers, and contributing to the end of Robotnik's dictatorship; all Super Sonic intended to do was to escape the Black Asteroid, and then kill Sonic and then everyone else.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SonicTheHedgehogMegaManWorldsCollide">Sonic the Hedgehog/Mega Man: Worlds Collide</a></em> has Sonic and Mega Man attempt to use Chaos Control to fix their worlds. Mega Man's set back to normal, but Eggman's desperate attempt to win ends up messing up Mobius, turning it into a different world... as well as voiding all of his victories, restoring the Freedom Fighters to the point where they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">Took a Level in Badass</a> and giving them more allies to use in their fight. His actions also had the benefit of cancelling out, at this time, nearly <em>all</em> of the other villains and assorted threats in the comic, with only those from the games and American cartoons still around. <br/><br/>To top it off, as Eggman adapts to the new timeline he says that his new memories will overtake his old ones. It was his realization that Sonic's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">embodiment of chaos</a> that drove him to make the tech that led to the crossover and slowly tear apart the Freedom Fighters to begin with. Once his memories fully adjust, he'll become less of a threat than before.

The resulting flooding destroys the burial site of Black Manta's father. He's understandably a little pissed.
</li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">Secret Invasion</a></em> arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a></em>, the evil Skrull Chrell managed to capture every non-Skrull member of the Runaways and hold them hostage, threatening them with death unless Xavin handed over Changeling of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers">Young Avengers</a>.

However, when Luthor attempts to kill Superman with kryptonite, the kryptonite poisoning actually weakens Superman's immune system just enough for the antivirus to 'infect' him, purging Superman of the virus and allowing him to work on safely raising both his own children and the children Luthor had created in a lab and kept contained until he had eliminated Superman's offspring</span>.

After the attack, key research ends up being transferred to the Casters at the same time Will is told he will die in a matter of weeks, giving them both the necessary research and the motivation to apply it. Thus, RIFT's actions <em>create the very AI they sought to prevent</em>. If they had done nothing, the research would still exist, but it would be very unlikely that human trials would be put into play any time soon, nor would it be likely these independent teams would share data, since Will specifically notes that he's never taken defense contract cash (which is where the research comes from).
</li><li> This also plays out later in the film. After Will's upload and relocation to Brightwood, he had kept to himself, working on peaceful advances in technology that were completely benign. Bree has fliers distributed accusing the Brightwood Data Center of human experimentation, which was a complete lie, and not long after that two guys mug Martin and beat him nearly to death. Will uses his nanomachines to save Martin's life, in the process upgrading him into a networked superhuman, again kickstarting the very thing RIFT sought to stop. It did succeed in getting their cause greater recognition, though, so, by accident if nothing else, it wasn't a total backfire.

First off, he included rules that make the Infernals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">have to act like B-movie villains</a> every so often, but said nothing about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch">who they have to do it to</a>. Instead of granting the Infernals their own innate Charms, he and the other Yozis decided to make it so they share Charms with their patrons... which means not only do the Infernals get access to the high-level Charms that make the Yozis worlds/gods, they could conceivably make their own Charms and infect their own patrons with their particular mindset. Oh, and then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaustianRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaustianRebellion">the Heresy Charm Set</a>... So basically, what you've got is a Hell-forged superpowered being who needs to act like a bastard to someone, has access to god-like power, and can sever the ties with their demonic masters.

</li></ul></li><li> And, of course, the big one that sets the whole setting off. Creation has been in a precarious position for centuries, with the overworked Sidereals, the Lunars driven to the edge of the world, the heavily corrupt (or absent) gods, the almost equally corrupt Realm, the forces of the Underworld massing, and the Fair Folk being just barely kept in check. Into this comes the person controlling the Realm (and its big superweapon that keeps most of the other big enemies at bay) mysteriously disappearing, bringing it to the verge of a civil war that could tip Creation over the edge. And then... the Neverborn and the Yozis conspire to break open the Jade Prison, and use its captives to make their own Exalted. Half of those captives escape them. They become the Solar Exalted.

<ul><li> During the Battle of Beacon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuttingOnTheReich">Adam</a> vows to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Blake</a> that his revenge for her abandoning him will consist of him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">hurting everything</a> she's ever loved. In Volume 5, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Blake</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MischiefMakingMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MischiefMakingMonkey">Sun</a> are unsuccessfully trying to convince the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleBitBeastly">Faunus</a> population of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticGhetto">Menagerie</a> to rise up and protect the humans of Haven from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternTerrorists">White Fang</a> assault led by Adam. The Menagerie population, however, are tired of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">humanity's racism</a> towards them and live there to escape the pain in the rest of the world. They have no interest in protecting humans from anything, least of all the White Fang, which claims to act on their behalf. When Adam hears about Blake's attempt to raise an army against him, he rants about Blake's family being a thorn in his side and decides to make good on his promise to Blake: he sends an assassin to kill Blake's parents and capture Blake alive. When the assassination attempt fails, the fact that the White Fang was willing to turn on its own people just for disagreeing with their methods, unites the Menagerie population against Adam's cause. As a result, a Menagerie army shows up to Haven with the Mistral police force in tow; the heroes weren't in a position to stop the villains from carrying out their plans, but Menagerie's intervention completely ruins both Adam's attempt to destroy Haven Academy and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s secret plan to steal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfPower">Relic of Knowledge</a> from Haven's vault using the White Fang assault as cover.
</li><li> Ever since Ruby wounded her at the Fall of Beacon, Cinder has held a huge grudge against the rookie huntress. When Salem sends her team to strong-arm Raven Branwen into helping retrieve the Relic of Knowledge from Haven, Raven demands that they kill Qrow in return. Seeing this as a chance to pay Ruby back, Cinder eagerly accepts, even though it sacrifices their advantage of Haven being empty. During the battle, Cinder, Raven, and Vernal, the supposed "Spring Maiden" slip away but before any of them can open the Vault of the Spring Maiden, Cinder reveals she has a Grimm arm and kills Vernal to steal the Spring Maiden's power — except Vernal was just a decoy, <em>Raven</em> was the Spring Maiden! Cinder loses the ensuing battle, leaving the Relic to be claimed by the heroes. In short, Cinder's lust for power and vengeance costs the villains the victory.
</li><li> Just before that, Cinder retaliated against Jaune by attacking and badly wounding Weiss... which led to Jaune <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaticSuperpowerAwakening">unlocking</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">his Semblance</a> and saving her life.

<ul><li> The main character, an orphaned young lady named Agatha, wears a locket-type amulet with pictures of her parents in it. The locket is her most prized possession, given to her by her paternal uncle Barry shortly before he mysteriously departed, leaving Agatha in the care of her adoptive parents, the Clays. She never removes the amulet for very long and is never far away from it. Agatha struggles to be an engineer and inventor, like her beloved uncle, but fails constantly due to the severe and sudden migraine headaches she suffers whenever she tries to concentrate. Near the beginning of the story, a pair of drunken soldiers accost Agatha on the street. One snatches her locket, planning to sell it for a little quick cash. It turns out Barry designed the locket to suppresses Agatha's "spark", her innate intelligence and engineering talent. With the amulet gone, Agatha becomes a super-genius. She converts a steam-powered tractor into a complex robot programmed to seek out the amulet and return it to her, an impressive feat in and of itself made even more so by the fact <em>she literally does this in her sleep!</em>
</li><li> It also turns out the waves emanating from the amulet are extremely dangerous to anyone other than Agatha, as the loutish soldier who stole it soon finds out. The amulet ends up killing him by slowly destroying his brain. His fellow soldier, actually his younger brother, realizes the amulet is the source of his brother's demise when it is accidentally broken open, revealing the mechanism within. The young soldier uses the address engraved on the back of the locket to track Agatha down, looking for vengeance. Normally, the amulet would dampen Agatha's genius ability when brought in close proximity to her, but the young soldier was nice enough to switch the thing off. The now brilliant, clear-headed and more confident Agatha easily out-smarts and overpowers her would-be attacker and turns the tables on him, tying him up and reclaiming her beloved keepsake.
</li><li> Later in the story, an evil entity known as "The Other" possesses Agatha and gloats over an incapacitated Baron Klaus Wulfenbach, sworn enemy of The Other who is also hunting down Agatha so he can lobotomize her and permanently destroy her spark. The Other notices Klaus is carrying Agatha's amulet, which has a trilobite design on it, the symbol of Agatha's real family, the Heterodynes. The Other decides to use the amulet to pass itself off as a legitimate Heterodyne heir and lay claim to their family castle, stuffed full of amazing and highly dangerous technology and research. As soon as The Other slips the amulet around Agatha's neck, however, she is able to regain control. That's TWO villains each cancelling the other out.

<ul><li> Xykon breaking Roy's beloved sword both fills the fighter with a vengeful resolve, and forces him to grapple the lich bare-handed. He promptly hurls Xykon into a trap-warded gateway, which blows the undead sorcerer's body to pieces: something Roy certainly wasn't powerful enough (yet) to accomplish with sword strikes.
</li><li> Also, Xykon is an epic-level sorceror, the Order has no chance of defeating him. Except, Xykon broke Roy's sword, and Nale sent Roy on a dangerous sidequest to get it fixed, which has resulted in Roy's sword being made of a material that is very effective against undead.

Instead, it just enrages the various nations and makes them even more determined to fight back.
</li><li> Following onto the above, the Soviets retaliate against South Korea's material support of Japan's Siberian invasion by launching an air raid which devastates Seoul, which causes South Korea and all the other anti-communist nations of Asia to abandon neutrality and declare war on the Soviets. And on top of that, China  which had been planning to declare war on Japan, counting on NATO not wanting to expand the war further by getting involved directly  realizes that it's now not a viable option, so has to resort to merely sending volunteers to fight for the Soviets.
</li><li> The Bolivians practice a particularly hardline version of communism, which involves arresting anyone who even remotely disagrees with those in power. When they do this to a popular army captain in command of a frontline division one the eve of a major battle with the Allies, the whole division mutinies and defects, opening a massive hole in the communists' defenses.
