Of course...Doctor Strange is suffering from a mental illness in this story so take this revelation with a grain of salt.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> has been accused of this for years, but it became most apparent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk">World War Hulk</a></em> where he easily defeats people he has no business defeating, like Doctor Strange. Though whether is it due strictly to popularity and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotInducedStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotInducedStupidity">Plot-Induced Stupidity</a> or the Hulk actually should be able to defeat such characters is often debated.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> has become a walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> in comic books and "versus debates" thanks to the words <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">"with prep time"</a>. Given enough prep time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">he is speculated to be able to defeat</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman">Death</a>, Taxes, Tofu, and Jelly Beans. The sheer amount of times he's faced Superman and lived would qualify him here even if nothing else would.
<ul><li> The 'Batman smacks down Superman' issue was subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCTheNewFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCTheNewFrontier">The New Frontier</a></em>; initially, it appears that Batman handed Superman his cape after Superman attempted to arrest Batman, who was refusing to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">register or resign as a superhero</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It's eventually revealed that the two men staged it as a protest against McCarthyism and the witch-hunts of the 1950s. At Superman's urging, no less.</span>
</li><li> More concretely, he made contingency plans in one arc to take each member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a> down should they go crazy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">Of course</a>, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueOfAmericaTowerOfBabel">fall into the wrong hands</a>, and work remarkably well on all the heroes.
<ul><li> Even those plans are sometimes criticized by readers. The plan against Flash, for example, relies on him vibrating through a special bullet, instead of just, y'know, moving out of the way.
</li></ul></li><li> In several stories, it's later expanded to note that every single one of the Justice League members have at least some vague plan to take out their team-members in case any one of them goes rogue. They vary in effectiveness, though. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Hal Jordan's</a> contingency plan shows one of his own moments of Popularity Power - his plan to defeat Batman was to create a jetpack, strap it to him, and shoot him as far away as possible to be sure. Despite certain obvious flaws, his plan <em>worked</em> (even if it was entirely unnecessary for a guy that can casually exceed the speed of light and destroy planets without trying).
</li><li> In one alternate universe, after Jason Todd was killed Batman went ...a <em>little</em> more nuts than normal...and <em>killed every single villain on Earth</em>, resulting in a utopia. <em>No one thought this was unlikely.</em>
</li><li> Fortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a> seems to be immune to Popularity Power. During Moore's run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em> Batman takes on the much more powerful title character with plenty of prep time after making careful preparations, including putting wood cutting buzz-saws on the Batmobile and bringing a herbicide thrower. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a> wipes the floor with him.
<ul><li> There are a few crossovers where Batman isn't shown as an all-around invincible badass. In one crossover between Spider-Man and Batman, they got into a brief scuffle and Peter grabbed Bats, tossed him half-way across the building. The priceless look on Bruce's face said it all as he was being thrown so easily.
</li></ul></li><li> And sometimes, even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">"with prep time"</a> is unnecessary. Like putting down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cheetah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cheetah">Cheetah</a>, who is a recurrent Wonder Woman villain, at times able to take a punch from Superman (who, for the uninitiated, has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">Super Speed</a>, which Batman lacks), with a single punch, running with three adults on his back, and sucking enough bullets to sink a frigate. And apparently, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripleShifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TripleShifter">doesn't need to sleep</a>.
</li><li> One issue of Batman Confidential had him fighting several members of the proto-Justice League. He took down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a>. This was their first meeting, and he didn't know what any of their abilities were when the fight started. It helped that neither did the writer. Let's see... throwing a smoke bomb in front of The Flash is yet another example of writers forgetting that 1. He has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperReflexes">Super Reflexes</a> and even so wouldn't immediately crash into a wall if blinded 2. If you're in a small room with The Flash, there is no time to throw something before he reaches you. There's not time for a human to do <em>anything</em> before he reaches you. Wonder Woman cannot be taken out by kicking her in the stomach with human strength. At a best case scenario it's ineffective. Worse case, you break your foot. The same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MartianManhunter">Martian Manhunter</a>. Batman's ability to manhandle Aquaman or utterly incapacitate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> with a batrope is also just slightly dubious (Aquaman has Wonder Woman levels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a> and Green Lantern can make literally anything he can think of with his ring).
<ul><li> The Wonder Woman scenario is even worse. Batman at first broke his knuckles punching her, which she did not even feel. Then he kicks her in the stomach, reasoning ""she has to breathe"", an attack which has much less chance of putting down a normal human, let alone a superhuman, but she is down and out. And then he is fighting the rest of her friends with few broken fingers. God...
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankMiller">Frank Miller</a>'s Batman/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a> crossover actually has their fight be even, <em>to a degree.</em> Batman beats down Spawn, but when Spawn turns the tables the rest of the fight is conveniently <strong>off panel.</strong>
</li><li> Wonder Woman beat down Batman in one of her issues. A criminal Batman was after sought sanctuary in Wonder Woman's headquarters, and Batman demanded she turn her over. Wondy said no. With her foot. In fact, Wonder Woman is a good case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a>, as his track record against her has been slightly against him. She's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Brick</a> with no obvious weaknesses who often sees through his ruses.
</li><li> Though in a Justice League issue, Batman fights a demonically possessed and thus enhanced Wonder Woman. Instead of getting stomped into the pavement, he gives her a fight, scoring some good hits, even drawing blood and temporarily restraining her at a point with nothing but his bare hands. Given their massive strength and durability difference this should be impossible
</li></ul></li><li> Batman's other villains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane">Bane</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> have benefited from this as well, like the time Bane onepunched the aforementioned Cheetah without being on Venom.
</li><li> Despite allegedly being barely superhuman,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0k272');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0k272" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0k272');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He's supposedly at the absolute peak of what normal humans can be capable of, i.e. as if he trained to that level like an Olympic athlete</span> some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s feats have gone seemingly far beyond what he "should" be able to do. Any average human superhero or villain who goes up against him is sure to lose. Even superpowered denizens like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> and Wolverine fold before the Cap. And if that weren't enough, Captain America has actually gone rounds against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner">Namor</a>, Hulk, and the other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> super heavyweightsnd STILL come out on top (or at the very least, fought these beings to a draw). Why? Because he's popular. Because he wears the red, white, and blue. And to top it all off, Marvel loves him so much that they'll almost never have the guy lose, just like DC is almost never going to have Batman lose. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> 2017's "Secret Empire" saga may actually change that, when it comes to Hydra Cap.</span>
<ul><li> Namor has got the worst from it, (mostly due to the lack of respect he has from more recent writers. Cap once knocked him out with a single shield throw (though to be fair Namor was not as powerful then), and then another time managed to defeat him after an extended fight through a shield bash. And another time, Cap defeated a clone of Namor who was created by Mr. Sinister, who had defeated the original Human Torch, in 3 pages. Namor on another occasion has struggled to wrestle Cap's shield from his hands, which is totally absurd considering the difference between their strength levels.
</li><li> This is made especially ridiculous in the animated movie, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateAvengers">Ultimate Avengers</a></em>, which has the team fight The Hulk in the finale and has Cap last better than any others who engage him in a direct fight. Notably, The Hulk takes down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> (an ACTUAL GOD) in two blows. Cap gets thrown all over the place and manages to endure around/over FOUR. Sure, he's bleeding and disoriented afterwards, but logically he shouldn't even be conscious.
</li><li> During the Reigning storyline, Rune King Thor, which is THOR empowered with BOTH the Odinforce (his father Odin's power) and power gained from magical Asgardian Runes, curbstomps pretty much everyone in his path, even defeating both Thing and Hulk TOGETHER off-panel, but Cap lays quite the beatdown on him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">Consistency, what's that?</a>
</li><li> Although there are a few well-known instances of Captain America subverting this trope. There are plenty of battles where he shows up, makes an inspirational speech about determination over power, then gets his ass handed to him (most famously against Korvac, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a>, and the Masters of Evil).
<ul><li> Though in the case of Korvac, Cap is shown to be visibly hurting him, making him cry out in. The fact that Cap's putting the hurt on a cosmic entity itself would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolButStupid">cool, yet stupid</a>, but on top of that, before and after the hurting Cap put on Korvac, he was withstanding blows from seriously pissed, legit class 100s like Thor, Iron Man and Wonder Man, which makes it more absurd, because anyone who can be hurt by Cap should literally explode from full force punches from those within Thor's strength class.
</li></ul></li><li> It should be noted that Cap's shield is often described as playing merry havoc with the laws of physics. For example, it's not just indestructible (it can shrug off a direct hit from everything short of Thor with the power of Odin), but it also arrests most (if not all) of the momentum directed at it, too. One imagines that works in reverse when used as a weapon. But still, all it should take is one shot from most people listed here and Cap is down for the count. To put in perspective just <em>how</em> weird Cap's shield is, the Avengers were, at one point, defeated by Molecule Man, an extremely powerful individual who can manipulate matter at the molecular level. Molecule Man messes around with the hero's weapons, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mjolnir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mjolnir">Mjölnir</a>,</em> but it's Cap's shield that freaks him out the most, not the ancient Asgardian magical weapon of storms. Why? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">It's never explained...</a>
<ul><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a> story, Cap's shield takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanSubstitute">Superman Substitute</a> Gladiator) at bay for minutes. Heat vision ("The heart of a star") and lighting-fast, moon-blasting punches don't even <em>ruin the painting</em> of the shield. Maybe it's not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> Popularity Power in action - the Star and Strips logo must be a reality breaker.
</li><li> It must be also noted that how much force Cap's shield can protect him also is very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>. In one story, Daredevil punching on the shield is forcing Cap back, while in another story it can take hits from Iron Man no problem. Cyclops blasts him a mile away in one story, while in another story the shield protects him from a blast from Galactus herald Airwalker, which KOs both Iron Man and Thor who were standing right next to him. On another occasion, Cap protects himself from a blast using his shield which knocks out Wolverine and Carol Danvers, both bonafide superhumans, while in another story landing shield first from a building hurts him. In one story, he is sent rocketing from a punch from Namor UNDERWATER (where he is at his strongest) but is unharmed and in another story, landing on water from a great height shield first knocks him out. In one story She-Hulk (someone who is several times stronger than Cap) has trouble blocking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mjolnir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mjolnir">Mjölnir</a> throw with the shield and an ordinary human dies protecting Cap from a blow from Thunder Ball in another story, but Cap has no problem blocking attacks from characters far stronger and powerful than Thor or Thunderball. Even when he has shields that do not have absorbing capabilities, he has no problem. He once, using a pure adamantium shield, blocked a steel beam swung by Mister Hyde, a class 50 Thor villain with no problem, which by all means should have shattered every bone in Cap's arm. Even worse, in another story, he is shown blocking hits from the Destroyer Armor with a (his original) steel shield, and the armor punching Thor in the same comic was shown to be shaking the entire city.
</li></ul></li><li> During the 90s, Cap had an encounter with a few of the X-Men in a scuffle which saw him getting frozen from the waist down by Iceman. The move did <em>not</em> stop Captain America on his tracks. He then somersaulted across the air and knocked Iceman out <em>while his entire lower body was frozen</em>, meaning that he shouldn't even have the kind of momentum to pull off such a move. Not only that, he effortlessly beat the crap out of Beast. To make things clear, Hank McCoy is no Hulk or Thor, but he's still a highly dangerous mutant who possesses strength, speed, and agility far better than the best of Olympic athletes AND he can lift well over thirty tons. That didn't stop the Cap from making short work of him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">It got worse</a> in the X-Men vs Avengers storyline when Cap went up against Gambit. During the fight, Gambit used his kinetic powers to charge up Cap's suit and levelled him with an explosion that should have reduced any human or peak human fighter to a charred skeleton. Immediately after the explosion, Cap emerged from the blast with no injuries and proceeded to punch Gambit out like nothing happened to him.
</li><li> Cap's powers themselves are sometimes overblown, as his accelerated healing is shown to have overcome a virus which those with bonafide healing factors couldn't.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance2">Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</a></em> parodies it best:
<div class="indent">"I wear the flag. That means I don't lose."
</div></li><li> Or like a fan put it ""Cap is the sign of human arrogance. The humans wants to believe that this is their peak""
</li><li> Or like another fan put it, ""a sign of patriotic arrogance""
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a> at least is fair about it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> always wipes the floor with Cap in their various duels, causing him to need rescue by more powerful allies, unless Cap cheats by shorting out his armor in which case <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> is basically helpless to do anything but lie there and eat shield, not really making Cap look all that powerful.
<ul><li> Even there, it is questionable, since it was the Extremis armor, which allowed Iron Man to be unharmed from deep-space pressures, take hits from pissed off Thor who was not holding back, and while low on power, take blows from Spider-Man (who himself is far stronger than Cap) when Spidey was enhanced to twice his normal levels and even be unharmed from a point-blank nuclear explosion while low on power. So Cap's shield strikes &gt; ground zero nuke explosion?
</li></ul></li><li> Civil War is also one of the times that Captain America defeated Spider-Man. This time Spidey offers a meager justification for it: "There is no 'next move' to read, for him, it's all one long move from start to finish, he has it all planned out in advance while you're still trying to react to his last blow.", which of course ignores quite a number of things about Spidey and Marvel in general but there you have it.
<ul><li> Actually Spider-Man was not beaten, but even then, Cap was dominating, and hurting Spider-Man with his punches, and to make it worse, Spider-Man was doubly enhanced from his normal stats, and wearing an armor which made him bulletproof and allowed him to take hits from Titanium Man, the Iron Man foe. And despite being so enhanced Spidey still failed to defeat Cap despite landing a few hits, not even knocking him back.
</li></ul></li><li> Captain America has also one-punched Thunderball, another class 50 Thor villain, who has tangled with heavyweights other than Thor like Hulk, Hercules and Iron Man. To make it even absurd, in the same book, just few pages ago, he was fighting evenly with the class 60 Giant-Woman.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> has been shown as possibly being Cap's superior. In their first meeting, Deadpool takes out the (mind-controlled) Captain with <a class="urllink" href="http://www.4thletter.net/gavok/deadpool/9.jpg">a solid hit to the junk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. In a recent team-up, an enraged Deadpool got into a heated battle with Steve Rogers, now Super Soldier. In that battle, Deadpool managed to put a really good hurting on the former Captain America. Just when it seemed that Deadpool was finally overpowering Rogers, he was shot in the back with several tranquilizer darts to end the battle and even then Deadpool was the one still standing while Cap was the one on his knees who looked worse for wear. Considering how Captain America usually shows up other superheroes like Wolverine and Spider-Man in their own comic books, it's quite amazing that Deadpool managed to come off looking really strong against Captain America with the implication that he might have won their interrupted battle if he were to continue going all-out.
</li></ul></li><li> Heroes aren't the only ones with Popularity Power. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorDoom">Doctor Doom</a> has become a villainous equivalent of Batman who can defeat anyone (given enough "prep time" (admittedly a FAR more stable claim than Batman, but still quite ridiculous)). Despite being the villain of the story, the good doctor has gained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">an immense following of fans</a> who believe he's capable of defeating anyone and anything, including the most powerful beings in the comic books multiverse. Given enough time to study opponents, it is said that Doom could defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thanos">Thanos</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Galactus">Galactus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">Hulk</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Darkseid">Darkseid</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a>, and even the almighty Rubik's Cube. It really is an almost endless list. <br/><br/>A really ridiculous example of Doom oozing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue">God Mode Suedom</a> was during an arc where he teamed up with Dr. Voodoo and battled their way across hordes of demons. Dr. Voodoo got taken down by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a> but before Ghost Rider could finish Voodoo, Doom came in and took Ghost Rider out with one punch. This is a highly dubious feat considering Ghost Rider has been shown to be able to fight toe to toe with Dr. Strange before, take some of his best attacks, and even defeat the Sorcerer Supreme after a brutal mystical fight. And of course, Doom's powers are only second best compared to Strange. Apparently, the message that the writers want to drive home is that one punch from Doom is greater than the sum of two Sorcerer Supremes put together.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> is a normal guy (albeit an ex-Marine) with a burning desire to kill criminals and somewhat dubious sanity. Despite this, he is often depicted as effortlessly outwitting, humiliating or beating up other super-powered characters who should logically be far more than he can handle. That said, it's zigzagged in that some stories have shown him being beaten up or humiliated in turn.
<ul><li> In the <em>Suicide Kings</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> storyline, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> beats Deadpool up to the point where he needs rescuing by Outlaw and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Daredevil</span>. <em>With a sword</em>. This is despite the Punisher being an ordinary human and Deadpool being a guy in peak physical fitness who heals all injuries, never gets tired and is almost definitely the best swordfighter in the Marvel Universe - plus, it's <em>his book!</em> In fact, any fight between someone with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> and someone without is only going to end one way — that would be why they apparently put DP's factor on a major go-slow for this series.
</li><li> Punisher was on the receiving end in a Punisher/Batman crossover. Bats beat him in about two panels and described his fighting style as that of a bar brawler, which given Frank Castle's rather extensive training includes SEAL training and one particular writer went into detail on his martial arts techniques....But mostly, that crossover is also another stupid case of Batman's own Popularity Power at work.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers">JLA/Avengers</a> crossover, Batman also kicks Punisher's ass off-panel after realizing Punisher is going to just slaughter a bunch of mobsters.
</li><li> In a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GarthEnnis">Garth Ennis</a> crossover with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, Punisher treats Wolverine with disdain, blasting off his face with a shotgun, then shooting him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">in the balls</a> with the shotgun for complaining about it, then running over him with a steamroller. In some fairness, Logan was drunk.
</li><li> When Punisher tried to assassinate Norman Osborn, then leader of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DarkAvengers">Dark Avengers</a>, he found his Popularity Power turned off, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daken">Daken</a> showed what a confrontation between Punisher and a Wolverine out for blood would <em>really</em> look like: Daken shrugs off everything Punisher has, toying with him, and then chops him up like a meat processor before dumping his chunks down the sewers.
</li></ul></li><li> That time Spidey took down Firelord, a former Herald of Galactus. We're talking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SilverSurfer">Silver Surfer</a>-level power. Granted, Firelord swore he would fight Spider-Man in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion">single combat</a> (and not just, you know, OBLITERATE NEW YORK STATE WITH A THOUGHT). Spidey beat him after throwing him in the East River, tricking him into a building in the process of being demolished, and exploding a gas station on him, but come on. This guy flies through stars!
<ul><li> To further explain how batshit insane this is: Heralds of Galactus are high order <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warpers</a> capable of exceeding the speed of light several thousand times over and demolishing planets without trying. The average Herald treats an enraged Hulk as a moderate <em>annoyance</em>; indeed, the Silver Surfer (who at this point in his continuity was only mildly more powerful than Firelord) once defeated the Hulk by the strategy of "let him keep punching me, without any effect, until he finally gets bored and leaves".
</li><li> This moment is so infamous within the comic fandom that "Spider-Man versus Firelord" has actually become a colloquialism used for this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAsTheyNeedToBe">Strong as They Need to Be</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">Power Creep, Power Seep</a> within comic stories in general.
</li><li> They did attempt a justification for this that is equally flimsy — supposedly, Spider-Man was able to outfight Firelord by adopting a hit-and-run approach that fully utilizes his agility and speed to dodge his attacks and go in-and-out, which proved to be an effective counter against Firelord using raw power. This still doesn't make much sense considering the cosmically-empowered being can go faster than the speed of light <em>at will</em>. While Spidey is certainly fast, capable of appearing as a blur to normal humans at peak, he's still below the level of your average speedster. But this is the closest they could get to justifying why Spidey could pull this off.
</li><li> And in the storyline immediately <em>after</em> the Firelord/Spidey fight — and we mean immediately after, as in the very same day — Firelord got smacked by the full power of the Sanctuary II battlestation, which had just finished spanking <em>the entire Skrull Armada</em>. Firelord was blasted all the way across the solar system and headfirst into a moon at relativistic velocities... and <em>got up out of the smoking crater, staggered a short way, and only then collapsed unconscious</em>. So, Spidey's fist &gt; Death Star level firepower and near-lightspeed collisions with celestial bodies.
</li><li> It gets worse. Literally <em>every single appearance</em> by Firelord in comics prior to this story had Firelord repeatedly both no-selling and dishing out Thor-level hits without straining himself. From Thor, Hercules, Ego the Living Planet, and the original Phoenix. Firelord had a 100% consistent pattern of needing Hulk-class strength to so much as bruise him throughout his entire publication history... until "Spider-Man vs. Firelord". This one was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>.
</li><li> Said incident was even mocked by Spidey himself in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance2">Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</a></em>, assuming you play as him during the endgame.
<div class="indent">"Did I mention I beat up Firelord once? No, seriously. Firelord."
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars1984">Secret Wars</a></em> also, infamously, had Spidey mop the floor with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>, including Wolverine, all on his own. (Though in this case it should be noted that Spider-Man didn't actually "defeat" people like Colossus and Rogue, just tangled them up in webbing long enough for him to escape.)
</li></ul></li><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityCrusade">The Infinity Crusade</a></em>, it is shown that Spidey's popularity power can even evolve into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodModeSue">God-Mode Sue</a>, with him defeating the combined forces of Thor, Moondragon, Invisible Woman, Sasquatch, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Moon Knight, Multiple Man, Gamora and Archangel while being under a magical illusion that makes it seem to Spidey that he is fighting his <em>human</em> friends. That's right, Spiderman defeated them all while holding back like how he would against ordinary humans.
</li><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>, take for example <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelVersusDC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelVersusDC">Marvel Versus DC</a></em>, which was literally one big popularity contest. One issue had a scene in which Wolverine is able to make short work of Lobo, an alien being that gave Superman a run for his money and destroyed an entire planet, in less than four panels, simply because polls showed that his stats were higher that week. Moreover, both of them have regenerative healing, but Lobo is able to regenerate his entire body <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a> if his entire body is destroyed. The best part? The final blow of the fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffscreenMomentOfAwesome">took place off-panel</a>, because, apparently, <em>even the writers</em> couldn't figure out how Wolverine could possibly win.
<ul><li> According to Stan Lee the "single panel" part is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutSuperpowers">Coconut Superpowers</a> moment...the polls were held close enough to the publication of the DC vs. Marvel volumes that most of the comics had to be drawn before the polls were finished. The result was drawing all the fights such that they could easily go either way until the very end.
<ul><li> And the artist had drawn an alternate ending depicting Lobo's victory (in fact, only the three final panels were different, where instead of Wolvie, it was Lobo raising his hand, picking the cigar from the counter and smoking it).
</li></ul></li><li> A later issue of Lobo's own comic implied that he was <em>paid</em> to throw the fight regardless, which <em>is</em> in-character for him while also nicely avoiding an outright denial.
<ul><li> To be fair, the contest was whoever was <em>immobile</em> first. Maybe in a <em>drinking contest</em>, Wolverine could hold his liquor better.
</li></ul></li><li> The same series also had Wolverine's X-Men teammate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> hand a smack-down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, which seemed more than a little unlikely to many objective observers; however, <em>X-Men</em> titles were selling better than Wonder Woman at the time.
<ul><li> Context on the above fight; Storm did not win by keeping the fight at range and spamming typhoons at Diana until she fell over, which would have at least made some kind of sense. Diana was able to make it to melee range and successfully connect with a kick to Storm's head, <em>and Storm still stayed conscious</em>.
</li><li> In addition, Diana's defeat then occurs when she attempts to block Storm's lightning with her magic bracelets and the electricity is conducted into her by the metal. <em>Diana's magical bracelets are specifically non-conductive to energy</em> — she's used them to block things like Superman's heat vision and Zeus' thunderbolts.
</li><li> On the subject of Wonder Woman, in the 90's there was a series of DC Versus Marvel trading cards. When it came time for the long-awaited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">Avengers</a> set, the artist had Wonder Woman, arguably the most powerful heroine in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, face off against ...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a>. While Black Widow is extremely popular and very kickass in her own right, she's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> with no superpowers, and as such shouldn't be much of a threat to Wonder Woman.
</li></ul></li><li> In his "Brainwashed by Hydra" arc, Wolverine takes on the like of Namor, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanLee">Stan Lee</a> knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WolverinePublicity">how many others</a>, without getting beaten or captured once. While this was arguably justified by Wolverine being given additional support by HYDRA (such as being teleported in and out on top of his targets, or given supplementary weapons), the key word is "arguably".
<ul><li> Somehow, Wolverine also managed to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIncredibleHercules">The Incredible Hercules</a> with little difficulty. The same guy who's fought evenly with Heralds of Galactus and Thor.
</li><li> A "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">What If...?</a>" of this storyline saw Wolverine practically <em>wipe out the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a></em>. This was especially headachey because it had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a>, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FatalAttractions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FatalAttractions">canonically pulled the metal from Wolvy's bones and left him for dead in the original</a>, shanked. It did, however, have Kitty prove why phasing is awesome.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Parodied by the Marvel character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquirrelGirl">Squirrel Girl</a>, who manages to hand some of the most powerful, godlike villains in the Marvel Universe a humiliating defeat despite having not particularly impressive superpowers.
<ul><li> It's reached the point where other people are starting to recognize her tendency to beat nearly godlike beings, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> gaining extra recognition for being powerful enough to be defeated by Squirrel Girl. Twice.
</li><li> This is helped along by those writers who dislike the idea of a joke character winning against people who outclass her. Those writers invent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">Ret Cons</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> the victory away... and the rest of the writers have her beat up someone bigger instead.
</li><li> As her squirrel companion Tippy-Toe once pointed out in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">Breaking the Fourth Wall</a> address to fans who reacted more humorlessly to her tendency to defeat Dr. Doom:
<div class="indent"> "Yeah, that's right. Squirrel Girl totally pwns Doc Doom. Know why? '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon">Cause of somethin' that happened in a story by</a> <strong>Steve-freakin'-Ditko</strong>! That's <em>so</em> in continuity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">So just deal with it, fanboy</a>."
</div></li></ul></li><li> A notable aversion came in one of the DC/Marvel crossovers, when the JLA went up against the X-Men. Batman, the most popularity-powered character of them all, sprang a surprise attack on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a> who, while he has plenty of fans, also attracts more hate than probably any other X-Man (with the possible exception of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gambit">Gambit</a>). Guess which one got taken down.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables">Fables</a></em> this is one speculated source of the eponymous Fables' powers. The more popular the story about a Fable is, the more powerful they are. For example, Snow White recovered from a sniper's bullet to the skull—her sister Rose Red might not have survived since most people have forgotten her part of the fairytale— Frau Totenkinder is one of the most powerful Fables in existence because she is every anonymous witch in folklore, and Goldilocks raises this to a level bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> when she discovers she can't heal any faster than the fish are eating her.
<ul><li> Jack Horner, who is every Jack in fairy tales (except Jack Sprat), exploited this by going to Hollywood and making a trilogy of movies about him. He's now effectively immortal, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">not invincible</a>.
</li><li> The series has actually avoided directly answering the question on whether Popularity Power is actually in effect. Frau Totenkinder for her part actually expresses doubt on whether it is or not.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> once realized that this was the reason that he can never die, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">in order to die</a> he decided to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> go out and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">kill</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">all of his fans</a></span>.
<ul><li> Does the same in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeadpoolKillsTheMarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DeadpoolKillsTheMarvelUniverse">Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe</a></em>. He also gives an interesting speech to Wolverine about his healing factor. He states that it's incredibly fitting: the popular character has a power that makes him immune to death. Deadpool berates Wolverine because according to him, Logan doesn't live because of his skills, but because the fans love him. This may come off as hypocritical, because in that alternate universe, Deadpool managed to kill people that he should logically never be able to kill (like The Avengers, Spider-Man, Galactus, etc...). Why? Because he's just as popular as Wolverine.
<div class="indent"><strong>Deadpool:</strong> Your tendency to come back from the brink of death has nothing to do with your healing factor. Your mutant power isn't regeneration. It's <em>popularity</em>.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Back in 2000, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtBusiek">Kurt Busiek</a> and Stuart Immonen wrote a short graphic novel, <em>Superstar</em>, about a hero who was powered by popularity. Kind of. The hero of the story gained superpowers as long as he had the energy to spare, but it was limited and did run out. His father ended up merchandising him to hell and back (even against his express wishes sometimes) with toy lines, live shows, televising his battles, etc. Part of the cost to watch the shows or buying the merch? A small energy donation, not even enough to make you wheeze from tiredness. Of course, being really popular and taking energy donations from millions of fans, he was actually rather powerful.
</li><li> The Marvel villain Arcade has to date, been 100% unsuccessful at killing any superheroes or villains that feature in his appearances. It's assumed that all of his success with Murderworld assassinations occur offscreen. Killing overweight and out of shape businessmen is one thing. But he is clearly out of his league with superpowered characters. But his offbeat characterization (not too unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>) is probably why he gets to stay around for the occasional guest appearance, and trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeALevelInBadass">Take a Level in Badass</a> in the pages of the cheap <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleRoyale">Battle Royale</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em> ripoff known as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/AvengersArena">Avengers Arena</a>.</em>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke">Deathstroke</a> is an incredibly popular villain. So of course, writers have to amp up his badassery from reasonable to absurd. The man has enhanced reflexes, speed, strength and intelligence, but only several times above peak human as opposed to, oh, Kryptonian level. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a> #3, <em>he single-handedly took out an entire Justice League roster</em>. He stops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCanary">Black Canary</a> from using her Canary Cry via a bag over her head. (That scream of hers can rip through steel). He beats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAtom">The Atom</a> senseless with the light from an ordinary laser pointer because 'the Atom has no mass when he shrinks'. (This directly contradicted how the Atom's power has worked since his very first appearance in comics.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> Kyle Rayner can't use his ring because Deathstroke grabs his hand, and uses his own willpower to overpower Kyle's. (Not only do GL rings <em>not work that way</em>, at that time Kyle's ring had a failsafe put in to refuse commands from anyone not having Kyle's brainwave pattern... and that's before you factor in the pure unleaded stupidity of Kyle actually being caught within arms' reach of Deathstroke at all, seeing as how <strong>he can fly and Deathstroke can't</strong>.) Oh, but at least in those cases, he put a <em>minimal</em> degree of effort in. Against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>, Wally West just ran right onto the tip of Deathstroke's sword to dodge his bombs. (Wally West can move at the speed of light — on a <em>slow</em> day. To be able to move too fast for Wally to be able to react in time, Deathstroke's sword would have needed a built-in hyperdrive.) He was eventually defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenArrow">Green Arrow</a> poking his bad eye with an arrow in frustration.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnbelievableGwenpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUnbelievableGwenpool">The Unbelievable Gwenpool</a></em>. Being an avid comic book reader that somehow found her way into the mainstream Marvel universe, Gwen is perfectly aware that she is in a book and that she has nothing to fear but cancellation. When going up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>, she is sure she will win because he's just a guest star in her book. Deadpool points out that he has an enormous fanbase and there is no way a D-lister like her could kill him which he demonstrates by easily overpowering her and her team. The only way she survives is by pointing out that the low-tier villain that trapped them and forced them to fight (the aforementioned Arcade) is the actual antagonist of the crossover which makes Deadpool realize they should team up to go after him instead.
<ul><li> Invoked again by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Future Gwenpool</span> in the fourth arc. She kills a future version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MilesMorales">Miles Morales</a> explaining to a shocked Gwen that it's not a problem because she knows she's not allowed to do it. Indeed Miles wakes up in his bed thinking his death was just a dream.
</li><li> Also discussed and played with: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Future Gwenpool</span> says that if Gwen becomes evil, she will have a long, successful comic series and could do whatever she wants. This is because the fans loved her as a villain, and her no matter how much she abuses the universe and its people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> will be invoked and fix any damage. Our Gwen, however, rejects this future and refuses to turn evil, because she can't bare to harm all the characters she's grown to love and care about. But she's fully aware that taking away her rise to fame would prevent her from becoming a hit and keeping her book from being cancelled, likely dooming herself to one day.

Boba has his gun taken out and then gets knocked over like a wuss by a rookie Jedi. He is then propelled into the side of Jabba's sailbarge when a blind man set off his jetpack. By accident. He then rolls right into the Sarlacc's mouth. The final humiliation is granted by the Sarlacc letting out a satisfied belch after swallowing him. Now compare him to the man who, among other things, went head to head with Darth Vader in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> story and came out of it alive.

<ul><li> Sylar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>. He's cheated death a half a dozen times and reached <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief">belief-defying</a> heights of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerImmunity">Joker Immunity</a> because the writers seem in love with him. Not only does he have a myriad of powers (which he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewPowersAsThePlotDemands">increase as the plot demands</a>, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowersAsPrograms">not without some justification</a>) he's survived two near fatal attacks (one of which he was originally planned to die from), escaped imprisonment three times, and Elle completely misses him twice with electric blasts when she nailed fast flyer West in one shot. In short, he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainSue">Villain Sue</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, "Destiny" had Angel and Spike in a titanic, epic brawl in an episode sometimes labeled a 'fan dream.' Spike often leads fan polls in popularity with Angel right behind him. Remember, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a> only happened because he was a fan favorite. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Originally the episode was to have Angel win, because it is his show, but the writers realised that they were missing a golden opportunity to drive home Angel's loss of motivation. Once Angel got back his groove in later episodes he would soundly beat Spike in a normal fight, even once as a puppet. It's also worth noting that Spike actually beat Buffy in a fight once, which Angel never did - though Spike has a particular advantage when fighting Slayers, because he's sussed out how they think, which is how he managed to kill two of them with relative ease.</span>
<ul><li> This carried over from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>, where Spike became immensely popular and went from a recurring villain to one of the main characters and underwent a full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. Through his time on the show, he ends up surviving a lot of things he probably shouldn't, as well as crossing the Scoobies enough that some fans argue Buffy probably should have staked him. Even when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>did</em> die in the season 7 finale, he was pretty immediately brought back to life on <em>Angel</em> and joined the main cast there.</span>
</li><li> Pretty much most of the focus of the <em>Angel</em> series was that he was well-known and going to be a popular player in the apocalypse. But on whose side? Turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was well in the midst of it already; who said the apocalypse couldn't drag out over decades?</span>.
</li><li> Faith gets this as well. She was originally going to be written out and had been given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedMonkey">Designated Monkey</a> treatment. Fans loved her however so she was kept for the remainder of season three. She then appeared in season four (Buffy) and one (Angel), eventually being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">put in a prison cell.</a> She would return in season seven\four.
</li></ul></li><li> In a bit of an odd example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IronChef">Iron Chef</a> America</em> and Iron Chef Bobby Flay. Now, he doesn't -win- an unfair amount, but he gets -chosen- more than every other chef in the show by a huge margin because he's the most popular Food Network star in the series. Basically, the episodes in which he's chosen get a lot more views than any other chef's, so Food Network has him picked all the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerrySpringer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JerrySpringer">Jerry Springer</a> didn't win, but he got a lot farther than his dancing talent alone would have carried him. It got to the point that he actually asked his fans to stop voting for him, as he only appeared on the show to learn to dance and was tired of coming back.
</li><li> This is also arguably the reason why Jerry Rice won out over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a>. Many people thought that Keibler was the most talented dancer on the show.
</li><li> In the British equivalent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrictlyComeDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrictlyComeDancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a></em>, John Sergeant famously pulled out because he felt that his popularity power was unfair on the contestants who were actually good dancers.
</li></ul></li><li> Xena from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/XenaWarriorPrincess">Xena: Warrior Princess</a></em> was a beneficiary of this, having grown popular enough to have her own spinoff show after appearing on Hercules. Even though she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">mortal warrior</a>, Xena has gone on to beat people far above her weight class and accomplish other feats that one would think is impossible for someone who isn't a god or demi-god. In short, she's slain multiple deities from Greece and from other lands, single-handedly fought off entire armies, killed off almost all of the Olympians, fought off arch-angels, and defeated not one but TWO incarnations of the Judeo-Christian Devil. Admittedly, she does gain the ability to kill gods but even then, it's questionable if she should even be able to exercise that ability against gods as powerful and as experienced as Artemis and Athena.

And then he won that match. And then 171 more. By the end of that streak, he had his own Popularity Power going.
</li><li> Another storyline involved a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWF</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">Jobber</a> losing a few matches to better-known wrestlers under names like "The Cannonball Kid", "The Good Luck Kid", "The Kamikaze Kid", etc. until finally, now simply known as "The Kid", he scored an upset victory over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ScottHall">Razor Ramon</a>. This earned him the name "The 1-2-3 Kid", as his entire gimmick was that he started getting upset victories, winning 2 more times against Razor Ramon, then beating other top heels as they came out of the woodwork to put the kid "in his place". Razor actually made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> simply by taking his losses in good humor and taking the kid under his wing. Eventually. As a side note, said kid was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SeanWaltman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SeanWaltman">Sean Waltman</a>, the wrestler later known as Syxx (in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewWorldOrder">nWo</a>) and X-Pac (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DGenerationX">D-Generation X</a>).

He'd go on to get two more wins, one more against Skip and one against Hakushi, and again Hakushi was able to turn face by taking his loss in good spirits (of course, Hakushi's face turn was somewhat less successful than Razor's, as he went from the enigmatic badass "White Angel of Death" to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyForeigner">Funny Foreigner</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ECW">ECW</a> did this with a guy by the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MikeyWhipwreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MikeyWhipwreck">Mikey Whipwreck</a>, who would take vicious beatings in the ring without getting in a lick of offense. Eventually, the fans started sympathizing with him, and started to root for Mikey to win ï¿½ and when, as a surprise substitute for Terry Funk in a match for the ECW Tag Team Championship (with tag team partner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Cactus Jack</a>), Mikey not only landed an offensive maneuver against his opponents (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TPE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TPE">The Public Enemy</a>), but managed to get the pinfall and win the match, making him even more beloved amongst the fans.

And Hulk Hogan always, always won, thanks to "the power of the Hulkamaniacs", even when faced with somebody who was bigger, badder, or just plain better. This went on for most of the '80s, and the beginning of the '90s, across two different wrestling promotions, before it got stale enough for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> to even be considered.
<ul><li> There's the half-straight / half-inverted example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>, particularly from his WWE Championship win in 2005 until his return from an injury in 2008.

<ul><li> See, WWE's plan was to push <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline">Jacqueline</a> but untrained Sable got really popular and got pushed instead. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a>, who had spent her first year as a valet, defeated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory">Ivory</a> in a match so fans began to take her seriously as a wrestler instead of another model. Since then it hasn't worked. When Kelly Kelly became Divas Champion and went over on Beth Phoenix twice, fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crowdchant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crowdchant">chanted</a> "BULL-SHIT!!" at her.

Brie at first played the part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableCoward">Lovable Coward</a>, hiding from Victoria under the ring only to magically reappear from out from the under the other side of the ring, slip behind Victoria, and roll her up for a pin. Yes, in her very first match! Then it was eventually revealed that the girl who'd pinned Victoria was Brie's twin sister, Nikki, who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeamTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeamTwins">switched places with her in the middle of the match</a>. (And then, double-subverted in that both of the Bella Twins remained faces for a time).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GeorgeSteele" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GeorgeSteele">George "The Animal" Steele</a> has said since that his feud with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandySavage">Randy "Macho Man" Savage</a> wasn't intended to last as long as it did but it got so over that they ran with it.
</li><li> If a heel gets popular enough they may make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> (which tends to curb said popularity, making them do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> and so on and so forth). The most notable example in Ruthless Aggression and PGWWE is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a>. Every time he attacked someone, people cheered him on, even when said person that was attacked was a highly popular face. It eventually reached a point that they had no choice but to turn Orton himself face. The dissolution of Legacy was originally have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDibiaseJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TedDibiaseJr">Ted Dibiase Jr</a> as the face and Randy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CodyRhodes">Cody Rhodes</a> as the heels. However, Randy's popularity made it so they had to rewrite the storyline to make him the face.

<ul><li> It should be noted that the only thing that changed about Randy was who he attacked. Otherwise he was still the same sadistic psychopath he's always been.

<ul><li> The fact that going against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a> is enough to turn the massively popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RandyOrton">Randy Orton</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> heel showcases <em>his</em> popularity power. Bryan had so much Popularity Power that it eventually forced them to change plans for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">the biggest show of the year</a> just so that year's main event wouldn't implode in on itself.

</li><li> Despite grooming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazuchikaOkada">Kazuchika Okada</a> to succeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HiroshiTanahashi">Hiroshi Tanahashi</a> as the new face of the company, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> ended up putting Hiroshi Tanahashi's matches back in the main event over Okada's, even though Okada was IWGP Heavyweight Champion. Why? Because the fans voted for Hiroshi Tanahashi to stay in the main event! Historically, the IWGP Heavyweight belt hasn't necessarily been viewed as the most important of New Japan's, even thought the company usually presents it as the top prize, due to cases like this, as well as popular wrestlers like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SatoruSayama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SatoruSayama">Tiger Mask</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShinsukeNakamura">Shinsuke Nakamura</a> making fans hold the Junior Heavyweight and Intercontinental belts in equal respect to it.
</li><li> Almost the entire reason behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobSapp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BobSapp">Bob Sapp</a>'s success in Japan. K1 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AllJapanProWrestling">All Japan</a> specifically picked him up from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> Wildside because they were in search of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Scary Black Man</a> that would resemble a TV show villain but the fan response was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants">exact opposite</a> of scared.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheRock">The Rock</a> <em>tried</em> to invoke this to put over his cousin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> at the 2015 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a>. If it had been for anything else, even if said event had occurred in Philadelphia like that year's Rumble had, it probably would've worked. However, the live crowd booed Rocky anyway, pissed at the company for doing such a terrible job of booking as of late and the fact that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> was getting what was essentially the biggest push any WWE Superstar could have. That's not to say Roman was <em>that</em> hated — had his main event push come at a later date, the fans probably wouldn't have reacted so bad. However, his character was so mishandled by management, that since fans can't boo any officials besides the McMahons, who are heels anyway, he's the one who had to take the brunt of the rage.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>, who was such an awesome wrestler that he always got the loudest pop in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a>. Attempts to turn him heel failed because of this reason — the most they ever managed was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral">Heroic Neutral</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard">tweener</a>. AJ never managed to become a <em>real</em> heel until he went to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a>, a company that had previously only seen his work personally a handful of times at the most, and became the new face of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BulletClub">Bullet Club</a>. Even then, he managed to win over the Japanese fans because he was, again, such an awesome wrestler. Said popularity would then follow him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a>, where his shirt would sell out within <em>less than an hour</em> of his debut at the 2016 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a>, and his entrance theme would crack the iTunes' top 100 songs within a day of being uploaded.
</li><li> After their perennial rivals reDRagon had petitioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RingOfHonor">Ring of Honor</a>'s match maker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NigelMcGuinness">Nigel McGuinness</a> for a shot at Matt Taven and Mike Bennett of The Kingdom in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revengebyproxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revengebyproxy">revenge</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AdamCole">Adam Cole</a>'s continual harassment of Kyle O'Reilly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheYoungBucks">The Young Bucks</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoked</a> this by petitioning <em>the fans</em> to get a shot at The Kingdom instead. McGuinness had already said yes to reDRagon and refused to go back on his word but did have The Bucks added to the match to appease the fans, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeleeATrois">three way</a>.
</li><li> With the retirement of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DanielBryan">Daniel Bryan</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> became the most popular wrestler on the main roster. While he isn't as popular as Bryan (no one is), the fans made it blatantly clear that they wanted him in the main event of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 32</em>. Hence, the disappointment when the company gave that spot to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a> (again) to, according to rumors, crown him as the next top babyface and Cena's successor for several years. They were <em>so</em> unhappy that it took the return of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShaneMcMahon">Shane McMahon</a></span> and Ambrose getting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrockLesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> match (making him one of the sub-main events) to stop the majority from boycotting the PPV all together. Then the match happened, and it being a standard Lesnar squash (albeit a no holds barred extended one) caused fans to turn against everyone involved <em>except</em> Dean (because of this trope and because Dean was more-or-less the MVP of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em> season, putting in so much work that it would be a disservice to everyone if they <em>didn't</em> reward him in some fashion). The pop when he finally won the WWE Championship at the 2016 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MoneyInTheBank">Money in the Bank</a></em> PPV was easily one of the loudest heard all year.
<ul><li> Ambrose was so popular that when he teased his long-awaited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> after his return from injury in late 2018, the fans <em>cheered</em> for him. Ambrose was only able to effectively turn heel by doing so the <em>one</em> night the fans couldn't and wouldn't accept it: the night Reigns was forced to relinquish the Universal Championship and go on hiatus from wrestling to battle his leukemia. The vulnerable atmosphere combined with the implosion of the Shield (by having Ambrose turn Rollins, his last remaining Shield brother), the very stable that Reigns was so closely tied to that he still used the same ring gear and music of it even after their initial breakup, was enough for the fans to finally turn on Ambrose and accept his new role as a heel.
</li></ul></li><li> The previous entry on IWGP fan votes doesn't mention who the number one contender to Okada's belt was for a reason. No Limit were once among New Japan's most popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">tag teams</a>, which basically won them a paid trip to North America, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">where they would be buried in TNA</a>. Then they would rebuild in CMLL, a sign of things to come. TNA sent its World Heavyweight Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a> to New Japan, NJPW attempted to use Hardy to jump start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TetsuyaNaito" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TetsuyaNaito">Tetsuya Naito</a>'s singles career and to say it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">didn't work</a> would be an understatement. Fans didn't care about the match, when Naito's partner Yujiro Takahashi turned on him because of the match or when Naito overcame the odds to ascend into IWGP title contention. When he was booed it was considered an improvement because fans often forgot about him entirely. So after "Okada" was voted out of the main event Naito went to Mexico again, hooked up with Rush and Los Ingobernables, saw how they turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">absolute hatred from the crowd</a> into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink">something they could work with</a> and took the idea back to NJPW to see if he could do the same with apathy. He fought his way into the G1 Climax and no one cared until they saw him basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker">slack</a> his way to victory over an utterly perplexed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Tanahashi</a>. Fans suddenly loved Naito, who for the most part acted as if he ignored them, which made them love him more. Suddenly he was IWGP Intercontinental champion and fans were given the chance to vote for him to main event WrestleKingdom over Okada, though Naito of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">turned it down, saying NJPW should let the heavyweight title match go last like always</a>. If he shows he cares he might lose support after all.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheShield">The Shield</a> is <em>the</em> most popular faction of the modern era of WWE — only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheNewDay">The New Day</a> can compare to their level of success. The fans love the Shield so much that even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>, who had <em>nuclear</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">X-Pac Heat</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after he retired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> 33</em> earlier that year</span>, shook off most of their vitriol when the stable reunited for their second run in 2017, as even Reigns' most ardent haters are/were marks for the Shield. The other two members of the group, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanAmbrose">Dean Ambrose</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SethRollins">Seth Rollins</a>, were already massively popular, and became even <em>more</em> popular when they teased a possible reunion (by the end of their reconciliation storyline in 2017, the fans were literally <em>begging</em> for them to forgive each other and reunite).

<ul><li> A variation on this frequently crops up in licensed roleplaying games: characters from the original canon will be given game statistics built on the presumption that such characters are <em>the</em> absolute best specimens of their particular niche. What begins as a hope for insurance against potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacters">Player Characters</a> running roughshod over the continuity can easily become ludicrous when compared to the game's own stated benchmarks for mundane characters, resulting in situations where such individuals couldn't actually be challenged/threatened by scenarios faithfully reproducing their own adventures. What makes it even worse are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> powers and ridiculously inflated abilities designers will give canon characters that are often direct violations of the rules. Players who see these stats and abilities can rather reasonably demand why <em>their</em> characters can't attain the same levels of power, which can put a DM in an awkward position.
<ul><li> Subverted often with those same characters. While they often have overinflated levels in the skills and abilities that they demonstrate on the show, they are usually so poorly built (as are most pregenerated "example" characters) that they cannot actually handle the canon adventures they are described as undertaking successfully, nor would they last very long at all in a real campaign. Nor would any PC with a mind to clear out the overabundance of Mary Sue characters have much trouble in doing so, even at a drastically lower level.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> RPG from FASA clearly assumed that not only was the Enterprise the most successful ship of its class in service, but that every position on the ship was filled by the single most competent individual in that field to be found in Starfleet. One must feel sorry for the security chief of any other vessel by comparison...<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16gve');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16gve" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16gve');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">there's a real-world parallel when a special operations unit would be formed and supposed to be staffed by the best of the best... which would necessarily at the expense of those troops' parent units who would lose them! For example, it's one of the reasons that the US Marine Corps went fifteen years without joining/contributing directly to US Special Operations Command — they didn't want to give up Force Reconnaissance.</span>
</li><li> White Wolf's <em>Street Fighter</em> RPG. Theoretically based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">the arcade game franchise</a>, a by-the-book starting campaign is more about the role roughly "real world compliant" martial artists would have in a world with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a> characters in it (i.e. window dressing.)
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> RPGs. All major characters are statted out, and they are indeed much more experienced than the PCs. However, the character's stats and xp are tracked for each individual season. Want to have Buffy on par with your group? Just set it around the first season.
<ul><li> Even then, the game gives you a choice of character type between Heroes/Champions, with awesome stats, and White Hats/Investigators, with worse stats but more Drama Points to begin with plus a lower cost for more Drama Points. There is also a third option, Experienced Hero, which gives you better stats than the Hero and the Drama Point use of the White Hat. The Experienced Hero is designed for a whole party to use together, for balance, to reach the power level of a slightly more experienced canon character, although still not quite <em>as</em> experienced as the canon builds.
</li></ul></li><li> A particularily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RTalsorian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RTalsorian">R Talsorian</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em> RPG. The Knight Sabers were built to ludicrous levels; Priss was superhumanly strong and could survive a hit from a 120mm cannon <em>without her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Hard Suit</a> or any other protection.</em>
</li></ul></li><li> Many roleplaying games use builds of the creator's own PCs as background for their publishing the setting. Having been played for many years, they obviously reach extremely high levels. But, having been played for that long, they usually are pretty good at surviving a normal campaign or fending off lower level PCs.
<ul><li> Elminster is obviously the most powerful of these for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a>, although most of the major FR characters are subjected to it in one form or another.
</li><li> Mordenkainen, Tenser and other characters got this treatment in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em> setting.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesAndOtherStrangeness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtlesAndOtherStrangeness">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness</a></em> had an elaborate character creation system that provided rules for creating mutant squirrels, Moose, Housecats, or whatever. But the title characters were impossible to create according to the rules. Their Ninja Skills were fine, but their mutations were more advantageous than was possible for Player Characters.
</li><li> The Revised Core rulebook of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsD20">Star Wars d20</a></em> Roleplaying Game gives all the main characters average stats. Coupled with the fact that they are poorly built, this actually means that the Luke (circa Episode IV) of the core books is weaker than many heroes on their third or fourth adventures. Fortunately, later supplements improved the NPC quality, bringing the heroes to an even level with the average PC.
<ul><li> Luke <em>wasn't</em> that powerful, though. Circa episode IV, he barely even knew how to use the Force, had only some casual pilot experience under his belt, and was really just on his first adventure himself.
</li><li> This is also somewhat a backlash from the WEG D6 version of the rules, which gave all the canon characters -incredibly- pumped up stats. Han Solo, who is shown in the movies as being a pretty bad liar ('We're, uh, all fine here. How're you?') is given 8d or so in lying for instance. And 8d being basically one of the best people in a galactic sector or such. Their other stats are just as inflated. (Starting PCs for the record could start out at 5d-6d). Their focus skills were even worse. Someone once added it up and decided it'd take over a decade to get as high as Han Solo or Luke.
</li></ul></li><li> Starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> 3.0</em>, dragons are given "Challenge Ratings" that are lower than usual for their power level. Thus, if the dungeon master follows the challenge rating system, dragons are always more powerful than whatever else the player characters are facing. The game designers state that this was intentional, so that encounters with dragons always feel special.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Kharn</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">the Betrayer</a>. The developers of the game seem to have notice his popularity after game's their edition, because his incarnation in the next rulebook made him cheaper to field and a stronger unit, and he essentially stayed the same in the rulebook after that.
<ul><li> The Popularity of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Black Templars</a> Space Marine Chapter was so notable, they got their own Codex which was something reserved for first founding Chapters.

But due to all the hype surrounding his character and how much the fans liked him, he not only got many more scenes but is now one of the supporting protagonists!
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> series, Cirno started out as not only being one of the weakest characters but being famous for it within the fandom. She's the second stage boss in the first game in which she appears and the stage one miniboss in the next game (making her the weakest boss in that entire game). However, her popularity propelled her to become a playable character in <em>two</em> later games. Her storyline in <em>Hisoutensoku</em> seems to put her as being as being only somewhat weaker than the main characters, putting her at well above average for the setting.
<ul><li> She now has her own game. Interestingly, however, she's depicted as being a lot less powerful than fans assume and even somewhat below her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingGame">Fighting Game</a> incarnation. Most of the foes she fights are fairies (of which she is already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">the strongest</a>, meme notwithstanding) and <em>she</em> gets roughed up in the process of <em>defeating</em> the Extra Boss (Marisa), a first for the series PCs.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Starting in Generation VI, several Pokémon have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Mega Evolutions</a> that make them bigger, more menacing, and more powerful. The creators have stated that the Pokémon chosen to receive Mega Evolutions are based mostly on popularity rather than balancing, with two of the most popular, Mewtwo and Charizard, receiving two Mega Evolution forms each.
</li><li> In previous generations, popularity was a factor when deciding which Pokemon should get a regular evolution or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOffBabies">baby form</a>.
</li><li> A form of this comes back for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em> where a few Gen I Pokémon were given alternate forms known as regional variants. This is a subversion though because these forms are explicitly not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> and the Pokémon that received them were largely ignored and stayed largely the same for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">20 years that the series has been around</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em>, both popularity and winning matches play into the final results of Splatfest events. This led to the first several Splatfests being won solely due to overwhelming popularity despite the other team winning far more matches. This caused everyone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComplacentGamingSyndrome">join whichever team was the most popular regardless of which team they actually preferred because it was practically guaranteed to win the Splatfest</a>. Due to complaints, they increased the amount winning matches influenced the final results in order to try and balance things out. This ended up having the <em>opposite</em> effect as now the <em>less</em> popular team is practically guaranteed to win, since the more popular team will often get matched against itself, and winning a match against your own team doesn't count for the Splatfest, while the less popular team was guaranteed to be matched against the opposing team and thus had all of their wins count.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>: Knight of the Fallen Empire</em> the loveable droid HK-55 was clearly intended to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a>. A possibility to resurrect him via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a> is explicitly shut down as impossible. However, because he turned out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakoutCharacter">Breakout Character</a> of the expansion, he was brought <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a> without his memory, though only for those who have subscribed on a certain date.

The next one again had huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWeight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperWeight">Super Weight</a>, Jean Grey as Phoenix... and then came the "leaders" of the two sides in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em>, Cap and Iron Man - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> and a man in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>. Thus became the benchmark for the 5* tier, unbelievably strong characters (Doctor Strange, Thanos, Black Bolt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015">God Emperor Doom</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AbsoluteCarnage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AbsoluteCarnage">Prophet of Knull Carnage</a>), strong characters whose comic book history boosts them (Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Storm, Iceman, <em>two</em> versions of Spider-Man), and tie-ins to new Marvel adaptations (usually the MCU movies, along with the Netflix versions of Daredevil and Jessica Jones, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Westernanimation/SpiderManIntoTheSpiderverse">Spiderverse</a> Kingpin; a few <em>were</em> powerhouses in the media, such as Captain Marvel, Loki, Thor, Hela, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfShield">TV's</a> Ghost Rider).
