It's frustrating, but it can be fixed.
</p><p>And then there are these. The instances where some content becomes available online for a limited time only (days, weeks, a season... or even years), and after that, the goodies are lost for good. Literally. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a>, no resetting, nothing. You lost your chance, now you're screwed.

Alternatively, casualties have demanded that the content be taken away from the public all of a sudden, contrary to plans. The result is the same.
</p><p>This trope can happen in three situations:
</p><ol><li> A data update to the game with additions that are suspended or removed by a later update.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> — new content that can be purchased (or obtained for free) for a while and then goes out of sale.
</li><li> Achievements, challenges, unlocks etc. which are only available through online play, and which become impossible to get once the servers are shut down.
</li></ol><p>There may be several reasons for this course of action. Perhaps there was some backlash about the quality or implications of the DLC and the creators are forced to take it away from the shop or the servers. Maybe the thing offered is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus">Pre-Order Bonus</a> or is simply temporary eye candy whose only purpose is to attract newcomers or keep the fanbase playing (this is especially the case with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> genre). Other times, it just turns out that the game developers are shutting down the servers for good, throwing every piece of online content down the drain.

<ul><li> <em>Rockman Megaworld</em>, a Mega Drive compilation of the first three Famicom games with 16-bit graphics and sound (and a small yet brand new secret fourth game), was in fact released in Europe as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan">Mega Man</a>: The Wily Wars</em>. The American version was only available via the now-defunct Sega Channel, meaning that the game was lost once the service was discontinued.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Hurricane Packs</a> for the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NinjaGaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a></em> Xbox game, following the discontinuation of the original Xbox Live service. While <em>Ninja Gaiden Black</em> carries over most of the content from the Hurricane Packs (extra game modes and costumes) and removes the famed Intercept move, which was deemed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">too powerful</a> by the developers.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">Bouncer</a> weapon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank2016">Ratchet &amp; Clank (2016)</a></em> is exclusively obtained as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus">Pre-Order Bonus</a>, and it was never intended to patch the game to make it obtainable afterwards.

Once the servers were shut down in 2010, the game became unplayable.

<ul><li> Predating EA's always-online games are Nintendo's Satellaview <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> titles. Specifically, the port of the original The Legend of Zelda to the SNES, and a sequel of sorts to <em>A Link to The Past</em>. These titles were transmitted via satellite and programmed to only be executable within a certain date and time, checking them against the Satellaview cartridge's RTC. Although the Satellaview will not delete these "expired" games automatically, they will no longer be playable. Especially since the game needs to be played while an accompanying audio drama is playing out on the TV at the same time. Thankfully, someone had made a recording of the audio drama, and coupled with the extraction of the game from the Satellaview cart and patched, the game is now fully emulated.
</li><li> In November 2012, Atari shut down the servers for the PC and PS3 versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostbustersTheVideoGame">Ghostbusters: The Video Game</a></em>, making the ten achievements/trophies only obtainable online impossible to get.
</li><li> The entire second-disc online multiplayer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamOrigins">Batman: Arkham Origins</a></em> became obsolete in 2017, when the servers were shut down. Along with the servers, all online achievements became impossible to obtain.
</li><li> The community challenges for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedIVBlackFlag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></em> are no longer available. Thus, all of the bonus items unlocked through completing those challenges are permanently locked.
</li><li> In late 2019, the activation servers for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TronEvolution">TRON: Evolution</a></em> went offline, rendering the game permanently unplayable.

EA pulled the plug on the server in 2016. The game's copy protection and has yet to be cracked due to lack of interest, and there are no private servers in existence because the server protocols has yet to be reverse-engineered for the same reason, and thus there is absolutely no way anyone can play the game at this time.

On December 30, 2014, the game and its 2 DLC packs were delisted, possibly due to the license expiring. However, the game is technically still available through either download codes or redownloading it, if you already bought it.

</li><li> <em>Legend of the Cryptids</em> has cards from limited events that are no longer available.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RageOfBahamut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RageOfBahamut">Rage of Bahamut</a></em> had limited event cards that can no longer be obtained.

<ul><li> Starting October 2016, the game began issuing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">special emblems and card sleeves</a> as Score Rewards. Each month, Score Reward progress is reset and these special rewards change, rendering them unavailable past that month unless they are made available through other means, like the in-game shop.
</li><li> Various emblems, card sleeves, alternate leaders, and card reskins are only available during certain events and rendered inaccessible past that point.
</li><li> The Grand Master flair and associated sleeve for any particular card pack can only be acquired by reaching Grand Master rank within the first 3 months after that pack's release.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hearthstone">Hearthstone</a></em>:
<ul><li> A handful of promotional Golden Legendaries can no longer be obtained. On the plus side, the non-Golden versions are still craftable, and the cards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionalPowerlessPieceOfGarbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionalPowerlessPieceOfGarbage">aren't actually very good</a> anyway.
</li><li> The vast majority of alternate hero skins are temporary content. Some were made available from defunct promotions, and most of them were bonuses tied to card bundles or pre-orders. Blizzard has given no indication whether they'll be up for purchase ever again.
</li><li> Reaching enough wins in Ranked each season unlocks a new card back to use, which changes each month. If you miss a month, that card back is locked forever (except in extremely rare cases, such as when the Ragnaros card back from 2014 was brought back in 2019's Fire Festival as a special reward).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Valkyrie Crusade</em>, as unique events are not featured again, limited cards from events can only be gained from random draws.
</li><li> This tends to be the case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneHundredPercentOrangeJuice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OneHundredPercentOrangeJuice">100% Orange Juice!</a></em>, which often runs limited-time events that have exclusive items (such as accessories, colours and even stages). Once those events are done, that's it; they're gone. That said, methods have been introduced to alleviate this somewhat, such as rerunning old events starting in 2018 to give those who missed out a chance to grab the items before they wrap up and adding items that have appeared in previous events to the Mystery Bag in the shop, but there's no telling what gets added and what doesn't<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0qwlm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0qwlm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0qwlm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And that's assuming that it doesn't just screw you over and give you nothing but a paltry amount of oranges.</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>, certain Servants can only be acquired by participating in certain events. While the game does occasionally re-run certain events, the free "Welfare Servants" acquired this way are permanently lost once these re-runs are over. Also, the profiles of Beast III/R and Beast III/L are only available by completing the events in which they were featured.

However, online play still works in the <em>Remastered</em> version of the game.

Averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation4">PlayStation 4</a> release, however, where all the DLC is available, including Jill and Shuma.

This also includes the digital Xbox 360 version for unknown reasons (although back in the day, full games for PS3 digitally weren't a thing yet until the Early 2010's, so no digital PS3 version never happened). Although no official sources mention anything about the delisting besides word of mouth by some social areas/forums for Soulcalibur. Fortunately, the game is still available physically, but those looking to have a complete character roster will be sadly attuned that the DLC characters for Darth Vader and Yoda are no longer available.

</li><li> While <em>every</em> seasonal loot box is this (at least until the event rolls around again the next year), a special note is reserved for the "Boop!" spray that debuted during Halloween Terror. There were two sprays: one that was simply "Boo!", something you'd expect to see in any fun Halloween event. The second was "Boop!", with the "P" added with purple spray paint. The spray wasn't given much thought by players, largely because the word really held no meaning and seemed just like any other random spray... until three days after the Halloween event ended, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">"Boop!"</a> was revealed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase">Catch Phrase</a> of the new hero, Sombra, and said catchphrase became an instant meme.

<ul><li> Halloween 2014 severely limited the amount of halloween items obtainable that year (a maximum of two free packs, containing three items each), opting out the gift system altogether. The reasoning behind this was to prevent gift farming. The fanbase claims that gift farming was absolutely harmless during the previous two years and <em>really</em> didn't approve of the change. The items obtained for free being untradeable didn't help matters either.
</li><li> Halloween 2015 replaced the gifts on all pre-2014 Halloween maps with... tiny gargoyles that gave souls, which you could easily get from kills or objectives. Players that wanted to get certain objects only available through Halloween gifts, such as the Halloween Spells from Lakeside, or the Saxton Hale mask, were not happy that these things were essentially gone. Not only that, but the update only added <em>nineteen</em> new cosmetics, compared to fifty from the 2014 update and <em>102</em> from the 2013 update. Indeed, the Medic, Sniper, Heavy, and Spy didn't get anything at all beside the all-class items, of which there were only four.

The "Valve Gift Grab-2011" achievement could only be obtained during Valve's holiday event back in December of 2011 that put several games on sale and earning this achievement was a part of that event as a shot in earning some gifts. It was brought back during Dec. 2012, but if you missed out on the event, then you will never be able to earn this achievement. The "Good Guy Nick" achievement requires the player to play with another player who is playing for free via the free weekend event and help them survive a campaign. Naturally, the achievement can't be obtained anymore once the free weekend event ends.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> has a timed event achievement called "Merry Xmas".

Eventually, however, the Facebook game was shut down, making it impossible to unlock the weapon. An update around that time got around this by automatically giving everyone the aforementioned weapon for multiplayer use... but getting it through that game unlocked it for singleplayer and co-op use as well, in which it is now totally unobtainable.

<ul><li> A few of the medals in <em>D.I.Y.</em> require entering microgame design contests that were periodically held by Nintendo. Nintendo no longer holds these contests, so if you hadn't already gotten the medals for them you can now no longer obtain them. Thankfully, it's still possible to get all the records even without these medals. The same, of course, goes for the microgames that won those contests. Even while they were running, you could only access the two most recent contest sets at a time to download their microgames. Now, you can't get any of them, unless you can get them from other players.
</li><li> Because most of the online services for the Wii and DS have been shut down, the online-related medals can't be unlocked anymore, meaning that not all records can be unlocked on one save file. Fortunately, there's a way around this as well: because the records you obtain from medals are semi-randomized, you can obtain the ones you lack from a friend or relative. If all you care about are the music on the records and not having the full collection in your game under the built-in section, you could also copy the music from the records you could get into new records in the music maker, send said records to DIY Showcase, then restart your game and get new ones.

<ul><li> Because of their nature, MMORPGs fall into this. While the longest-running games such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Everquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Everquest">Everquest</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaOnline">Ultima Online</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnarchyOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnarchyOnline">Anarchy Online</a></em> are still going strong, it's a truism that unlike games with a standalone single-player or player-side multiplayer component, these games <em>will</em> inevitably shut down and become unplayable at some point in the future, if they haven't already. A list of the most well-known defunct MMOs can be found <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Inactive_massively_multiplayer_online_games">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but a few of the examples which stand out include:
<ul><li> Disney's MMOs (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToontownOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToontownOnline">Toontown Online</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnline">Pirates of the Caribbean Online</a></em>) both shut down on September 19, 2013. Disney's reason was that the quest-driven MMOs weren't profitable for the company anymore. While the server side of the games isn't released for obvious reasons, a group of fans are taking to writing their own servers- In the form of <em>Toontown Rewritten</em> and <em>The Legend Of Pirates Online</em> respectively.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NCSoft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NCSoft">NC Soft</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em> shut down on November 30, 2012, after the publishers decided to unceremoniously shut it down. Whether this was indeed financially motivated is still unclear.
</li><li> The original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> shut down after severe content issues, the sacking of much of the devteam, and huge outcry from fans. It was later rereleased as <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, with a far, far better development in play, but much of the original content, such as the original Hildibrand Manderville quests, is only nodded towards in the new game's lore, and several pieces of equipment and mounts from the original version have never been rereleased in <em>ARR</em> or the expansions as a way for veterans to distinguish themselves.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNightsAOL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNightsAOL">Neverwinter Nights (AOL)</a></em>, which lasted from 1991 to 1997 until disagreements between TSR, America Online, and SSI killed it off.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> has featured limited time event only items that cannot be traded to other players, such as the Moogle Rod from Fan Festival 2006.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>, Events and Collaborations will only be available for a limited time. Likewise, subverted if the event later gets a re-run or archived into the Side Stories, allowing players to replay them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimmsNotes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrimmsNotes">Grimms Notes</a></em>, Sky and Rebirth heroes hail from limited-time events which never get re-runs (they aren't even available in the final gacha). This means new players will never be able to get them, unless they have a time machine in hand. Frustratingly, said heroes tend to show up again in the plot, and you even get to <em>fight</em> some of them!.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Facebook">Facebook</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyMultiplayerOnlineRolePlayingGame">MMORPG</a> <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_Wars">Mob Wars<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> had a weekly limited heist that was offered from the 8th to the 13th of Feb '11 which involved <a class="urllink" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=269827&amp;id=8743457343">"smuggling a man-eating shark into their private pool"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> Trophies: A "be there for the rollout of ascension" trophy and a "learn 30 recipes for a crafting method that no longer exists" trophy are the only <em>truly</em> unattainable trophies left. For a long time, "not have pants equipped one particular New Year's when Skully created a trophy on a whim" and "waste 10/100 turns on one particular year's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeanXmas">Crimbo</a> event" were the infamous examples of unattainable trophies, but they've both been given alternate unlock methods.
</li><li> Items: Sufficiently old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Items-of-the-Month</a> are no longer attainable as the supply gradually dwindled to nothing. The hand turkey outline is probably the most infamous example, mostly due to the very last ones being purchased by a bug exploiter who promptly got banned for it. Event items, of course, are generally no longer created when the associated event is over, though only some of them are truly <em>gone</em> (by being untradable as well). But a surprisingly large number of them ended up coming back when an item was released that could summon random monsters.
</li><li> Monsters (and associated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium">Manuel data</a>): Any time a quest gets revamped, only <em>most</em> of the monsters are reused, and all but one of the main quests have been revamped at least once. And monsters exclusive to events, of course. Non-bosses that have Manuel factoids can still be summoned by the above-mentioned item (and many lost monsters that predate Manuel actually had factoids <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> in for just that reason), but the bosses are still gone forever, most notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Puzzle Boss</a> guardians of the old Sorceress's Tower.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2">Phantasy Star Online 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> As one would expect, the Collaboration Scratches. Once their Scratch card expires, that's it. No more new stuff. The only remaining stuff is what currently exists when the Scratch expires, which means the price of said gear will proceed to <em>skyrocket</em> once it's no longer readily available. And God help you if you want any of the older Collaboration items, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Evo. Device/Kyubey</a> or whatnot.
</li><li> In a strange case where this applies to common equipment, many of the older, common-rarity gear is no longer obtainable by normal means. This is because the introduction of New Type grinding brought with it a change that removed a bunch of older gear from the drop tables that used the original Grinding system and replaced it with gear that uses the new New Type grind system; as such, much of that gear can no longer be found except by looking on the Player Shops. Some of the replaced gear does drop in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2es" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline2es">Phantasy Star Online 2es</a></em>, however, since that game didn't accommodate for the New Type update and thus some gear can still be found as regular drops or as Weaponoid Presents.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has done this lots of times, in many different ways. There are lots of items, achievements and titles that can no longer be obtained, or quests that can't be done anymore.
<ul><li> Several one-time-only events offered goodies which are otherwise unobtainable. A particularly rare mount could only be obtained after an event requiring countless man-hours from the entire server, for a period of less than a day. Any future new servers will have this event completed already, as well. Add in holiday rewards, anniversary pets, world events, and advertising promotion rewards...
</li><li> Some achievements are no longer obtainable, whether from being tied to a one-time event (such as logging in during World of Warcraft's anniversary) or from removed content (such as completing the original Zul'Gurub, or maximizing weapon skill), and those that are become Feats of Strength, worth no points.
</li><li> Many NPCs and quests from the original WoW were wiped off the map in the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion or otherwise went missing without explanation. Well, apart from the fact that a psychotic black dragon had recently wreaked major havoc across the kingdoms and killed millions throughout the world. Oddly enough, many NPCs that were made redundant from certain changes still stick around, such as additional profession trainers (there used to be one for each rank) or the class trainers (while they still offer a few services, there is no need for one for each class in every capital city). While the old quests would be completely outdated by today's standards (the content aged poorly and was already feeling clunky and old by 2007), they contained a lot of story that new players won't be able to experience anymore when the old world was paved over - like the Onyxia quest chain - as the new quests focus on story set during the events of "Cataclysm". As for items, the most blatant example is the Black Qiraji Battle Tank mount. Back then, the only way to get it was by being the first one to open the gates of Ahn'Qiraj, something so hard to accomplish that it's said less than one player by server owns it, especially now that the related event was removed during "Wrath of the Lich King". As for levels, there were many dungeons that got completely reworked in later expansions, with the old versions no longer accessible, such as Naxxramas, Onyxia's Lair, or Upper Blackrock Spire (the latter example in particular being particularly blatant, with the old version being a candidate for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestLevelEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BestLevelEver">Best Level Ever</a> and the new version being an unremarkable dungeon belonging to what's seen as the worst expansion to players).
</li><li> The first expansion "Burning Crusade" saw the quests related to Karazhan being removed when "Legion" added a second visit there. The quest chain provided plenty of lore about the tower, the Kirin Tor, and Khadgar himself.
</li><li> The second expansion "Wrath of the Lich King" saw the Battle for Undercity, the conclusion for the Wrathgate chapter of the storyline, completely removed during "Cataclysm", related to Undercity getting a revamp in said expansion and said Battle taking place in the old version. Without it, the Wrathgate quest chain suddenly just ends with you standing in front of Alexstrasza, who has nothing to say while the Alliance and Horde armies lie dead all around you. You then mount up and fly to Grizzly Hills because there's nothing left to do. Striking back against Putress was a satisfying conclusion to the storyline. Before that, Varimathras - an important demonic NPC who was made a killable villain during said quest chain - was removed to players who had completed the quest chain, preventing access to a a few low-level quests which he gave out. However, a new orc NPC was added in patch 3.3. who handed out the same quests as Varimathras did.
</li><li> The fourth expansion "Mists of Pandaria" saw the Vale of Eternal Blossoms being completely destroyed at the end of the storyline, preventing the players not only from seeing the old place but from doing the quests taking place there. The Vale of Eternal Blossoms, now corrupted by the Sha, used to be a beautiful and golden valley with an almost entirely different set of quests and exclusive storylines. This zone was available for less than a year, disappearing entirely when Garrosh's actions ruined the vale. However, by far the worst example here is the removal of the legendary cloak quest chain during "Warlords of Draenor". Not only these quests contained a lot of story regarding Wrathion, but the reward for completing them is completely necessary to access a fight against a boss, Ordos. Players who didn't get the cloak with at least one of his characters back when these quests were available simply can't fight Ordos.
</li><li> Blizzard repeated the previous example during the fifth expansion, "Warlords of Draenor", with the legendary ring quest chain being removed during "Legion". Although this time there was no boss who required the ring, the quests involved a lot of story regarding Guldan and Cordana Felsong, and featured exclusive lore and interactions with Khadgar, Garona, Yrel, and others. Without that story, Guldan basically appears out of nowhere in Tanaan Jungle and Cordana Felsong's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> in "Legion" is completely unexplained. The events that occur within these quests have ramifications that run all the way into current content, and their removal makes later developments in certain plotlines confusing and half-explained.
</li><li> <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> introduced the Black Market, an NPC auction house where many (formerly) unavailable items such as unique mounts and old raid loot are put up for bidding at exorbitant prices. The revamped Darkmoon Faire introduced in <em>Cataclysm</em> added cosmetic versions of the old dungeon gear sets that were formerly unavailable.
</li><li> Every new expansion has in-game pre-launch events of some form that offer either items or story events that are unavailable afterwards.
<ul><li> <em>Burning Crusade</em> had a small demon invasion. Helping fight them granted players the unique Tabard of the Protector.
</li><li> <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> had a richly detailed zombie epidemic event and several important story events. Players who did not participate may not be aware of when Variann Wrynn returned to the Alliance or that Garrosh challenged Thrall for the position of War Chief. Several pets and unique items could only be acquired during this period.
</li><li> <em>Cataclysm</em> had elemental invasions, doomsday cultists running amok in capital cities, and Orgrimmar burning to the ground so it could be rebuilt with a new style. More notable were the Operation: Gnomeregan and Zalazane's Fall events, wherein the gnomes and Darkspear trolls each tried to reclaim their homes. Completion gave unique toys and tabards.
</li><li> <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> granted special toys to players who completed the first scenarios released in the game.
</li><li> <em>Warlords of Draenor</em> was opened with a special quest chain in the Blasted Lands trying to stem the flow of the Iron Horde into Azeroth. Completion granted a unique battle pet.
</li><li> <em>Legion</em> saw entire zones being overrun with Legion invasion forces, with Alliance and Horde working together to drive them out. Players could acquire new armor and weapon skins along with a new pet.
</li><li> <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> has the War of Thorns, the storyline which covers the Horde's conquest of the Night Elf lands and the destruction of Teldrassil. Each faction received a unique mount for completing the story.

Starting with Season 2 this content was made permanently available to qualifying players, but Season 1 was only available while each event was live content. The developers have made some noise about making it available again in some fashion, but at present the only way to know what happened in-game is by talking to historians and other characters.
</li><li> The Bazaar of Four Winds and Queen's Gauntlet are special events focused on unique player challenges and mini-games. After the events of Season 2, neither event repeated for five years.
</li><li> The first Halloween event told the story of Mad King Thorn's return to Kryta for Halloween after a century of silence and the player's attempt to keep him from fully returning. Later events told the story of Bloody Prince Edric and his own attempts to claim both Kryta and the Realm of Madness. Both stories have since been rendered historical, leaving the details of the Thorn's family squabbles unclear and the Ascent to Madness dungeon with no context.
</li></ul></li><li> Discounting its servers being shut down after only 2 years, with new content patching stopping nearly a year earlier, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthAndBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthAndBeyond">Earth &amp; Beyond</a></em> had an evolving world. As each patch moved the story forward all previous story missions were removed. Unfortunately, this served as a detractor to new players. They were dropped into a story they didn't understand, and 1 major patch involved an invasion that put high level enemies in low level zones where quests still existed for new characters to obtain skills.

<ul><li> There are some rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">DLC</a> costumes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LittleBigPlanet">LittleBigPlanet</a></em> that players can miss out on, mostly rare shirts and hats. There are special shirts (and occasionally hats) available at each game's launch, the Slurpee Shirt, which you got by redeeming codes that were on the bottom of Slurpee cups, a shirt in the second game that was only possible to get by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreOrderBonus">pre-ordering</a> the Vita game, and 3 shirts with each of the new playable characters from the third game (and one with the 3 from the logo) for pre-ordering the digital version of <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em>. In <em>Karting</em>, there's the Target Racer for pre-ordering the game from said store.
</li><li> A kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">No Export for You</a> example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em>, which are still avaliable on PSN and XBLA, but were delisted in various other regions, specifically in Latin America which these games are unable to buy or get via download code. However, a cheat to get them anyway is to change console region to US and then they can be downloadable.
</li><li> The original Dreamcast versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> and to a lesser extent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2</a></em> had a number of online features that were missing from all later ports. There were online contests and global rankings with physical rewards, downloadable events and challenges, and the ability to share Chao online. Additionally, players could download rare and otherwise unobtainable Chao from the Black Market. Nearly all of these features were lost even for the Dreamcast versions, as they used the games' official websites, which closed down years ago. Players can still find most of the Dreamcast-exclusive DLC floating on the web, and they can still be played despite their online contests no longer being active, but the first kart event, and the Black Market Chao downloads, seem to be lost.
</li><li> The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> has Casino Night Zone available as DLC, but it can only be obtained through a download code given out through pre-orders of the game at specific physical retailers. (The United States had it the worst, as GameStop was the only retailer.) If you didn't pre-order the game and can't find anyone who held onto their download code without using it, you're out of luck. That being said, it is still available to download on both systems to this day; you just need the download code for it. As if to apologize after people complained, when <em>Sonic Generations</em> came out for Steam, Casino Night was made available for purchase soon after the game was released there and has been continuously available since.

Activision added the DLC back online for <em>MUA2</em>, but it wasn't put up in PS3 outisde the United States. Then the DLC was withdrawn one more time on December 31st, 2010...

The remaining games avert this, as they allow the player to access and tackle the multiplayer campaigns solo without needing to connect online or look for additional local players.

These can be obtained either by going online and downloading them for free, going to GameStop or a similar store for a download code, or participating in an online competition through the Global Link. Unlike most examples of the trope, however, such content is hard-coded onto the cartridge even before it receives an official release years after release, so it's at least possible to hack it into regular gameplay.

The player could then battle Giovanni, and if they won, Giovanni would finally end his wish to restore Team Rocket to its former glory.

In order to get all of these medals, you needed to have brought over <em>100</em> Pokemon.
</li><li> Applying to both <em>Black and White</em> and their sequels:
<ul><li> The ability to change your C-Gear and Pokedex skins are lost, which could only be done through the Global Link system.
</li><li> When the Dream World was still up, one could download and obtain a great number of Pokémon that you normally couldn't and most of them came with hidden abilities and all of them came in a Dream Ball. Since it shut down there's no way to obtain anymore of them in the Gen V games. Most of them are obtainable in later generations but there are a few that aren't and must be bred from parents that were.
</li><li> Berry planting was done in the Dream World in these games, and there was no way to transfer berries from old generations. So with its removal, it's no longer possible to grow berries, and while you can still find a few berries in the offline games, many of them are only available in limited quantities per game. And that's not even getting to the Dream World-exclusive berries.

<ul><li> Mega Stones for Pokémon that were not native to Alola were only available online. Either they were given as prizes for participating in Wi-fi competitions or as codes. Each code gave you up to 4 Mega Stones and they stop working at the end of October 2017, just a few days before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonUltraSunAndUltraMoon">Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon</a></em>'s release.

It's been suggested that these Mega Stones will be available later on in the game once it's more complete, but for the moment they play this trope straight. Flygonite used to be this but can now be found in-game.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2014 mobile ports of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>: all game saves and game data are stored on the server and what the player got when they downloaded the game was just a client. As a kick to the groin, the game shut down just 6 months later within the same year.

Got the game later than that and want the exclusive outfits, items, and camera filters? Too bad. Adding insult to injury, getting the Master Assassin's Robe outfit required an item obtained from completing the carnival, which closed for good shortly after the Assassin's Festival launched.

<ul><li> As time has passed, some songs have become unavailable for purchase due to relicensing issues and/or being locked behind special offers or exports. As of October 2018, over 250 songs are unavailable to purchase, including most of the tracks on Rock Band 1, 2, and Lego. Anyone who purchased these songs before they were removed can download and play them freely, however, and select tracks have been rereleased as DLC for Rock Band 4.
</li><li> This applies to the <strong>entirety</strong> of the Rock Band Network, a service that allowed people other than Harmonix to create DLC for purchase. In Late 2017, all available RBN songs were pulled down from the store. However, select RBN tracks have been rereleased as "new" DLC for Rock Band 4. Unlike Official DLC, these must be purchased again even if you previously owned the original release, as RBN tracks and official DLC have different rights processes.
</li><li> When the three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a> songs were pulled from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBandWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RockBandWorld">Rock Band World</a></em>'s library, the "Master of Metallica" goal went with it.
</li><li> While most songs that get removed do so after 5 years or so, a couple songs had a very short window of purchasability. For example, <em>Runnin' Wild</em> by Airborne was only available for 2 years, going up in August 2008 and coming down in March 2010. The king of limited availability, however, was <em>Snoop's Upside Ya Head</em> by Snoop Dogg, which was pulled after <strong>less than three months</strong>, going up in September 2010 and coming down in November.
</li></ul></li><li> No song was removed from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex">Sound Voltex</a></em> series until June 1, 2016, when "Cyber Thunder Cider" was removed due to an expired license.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoundVoltex">Sound Voltex</a> II</em> has POLICY BREAK songs, straight ports of songs from other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BEMANI">BEMANI</a> series in a series that otherwise does not allow non-remixed/arranged ports.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jubeat">jubeat</a> saucer</em> experimented with this idea with its "song swap" system: once a month, currently-available songs would be removed and some previously-removed songs would be brought back.

<ul><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> is beta and thus under constant development, all of the below is subject to change at the whims of the developers; for now, there's a significant double-whammy:
<ul><li> There are elite, one-of-a-kind versions of various weapons (Dex for celebrating the game's anniversary, Wraith for supporting Grineer during events, etc.) Once the relevant event to acquire these weapons passes, they're gone, and barring a future event by the developer, new players can never obtain them. These versions are flatly superior to their normal versions, so it can miff some players that they may be stuck with inferior versions of their favorite weapons. Fortunately, the anniversary weapons return each year, and old event weapons have slowly been making their way back into the game through Tactical Alerts, Sorties, and Baro Ki'Teer's wares.
</li><li> Prime weaponry are similar to the above, being upgraded, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingBlingBang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingBlingBang">gold-and-white trimmed</a> versions of existing weaponry. Unlike the event weapons, these weapons can be obtained by any player with persistent farming for the blueprints and components (or, for the lazy, they can just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">buy them from other players</a>); however, starting with Volt Prime's release, the oldest Primes get shelved with each new Prime Access. Items do get brought back occasionally, but at a much slower rate than items going away in the first place, and they only come back for a month at a time. Specters of the Rail alleviated some of the frustration with the overhaul to Void, since players can still use existing Relics to farm vaulted items, but you're out of luck for items that were vaulted before the change, and the Relics can start to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">Too Awesome to Use</a> over time as the supply diminishes.
</li><li> Played dead straight with the very first Primes: Excalibur, Lato, and Skana. These were part of the Founders' Package during the earliest parts of the game's beta; as part of the deal, now that those packages are no longer available, those Primes are out-of-reach for any player that doesn't already have one (and DE has confirmed they WON'T be coming back.)
</li><li> To a lesser extent, played straight with the events themselves. While some of them (Survival, Excavation, injecting and defending toxins from the Cicero Crisis) remain in the game in some form, many of the original, unique maps and gameplay modes, and ALL of the unique dialogue, lore, and character interactions, are gone, with no way for new players to experience them (short of brief text blurbs in the Codex.)
</li></ul></li><li> A sizable portion of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilterTheOmegaStrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilterTheOmegaStrain">Syphon Filter: The Omega Strain</a></em>'s unlockable content could only be unlocked via online co-op multiplayer, often involving team-dependent mission objectives, and thus became permanently inaccessible once the servers closed down in 2008.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> games have a couple of these.
<ul><li> The Splatfest Tee is a special shirt with Special Saver (the first game) or Ability Doubler (the second game) and three slots for sub-abilities to fit into. The problem is that they are only around for a given Splatfest and must be returned when the event is over, at which point everything on those tees is lost. When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> came about and offered the ability to wash ability chunks off of clothes, it was no uncommon thing for players to do that before turning the tees in, something which became palatable when Murch offered a massive 90% discount for the service. Even then, and with the addition of constant refilling the shirt's EXP gauge to get new ability chunks afterwards, laundromat services still were commonplace, and some players just wish you could keep the tee afterwards. After the final Splatfest of <em>Splatoon 2</em>, an update introduced the Splatfest Tee Replica, a replacement shirt obtainable through a news post; it doesn't completely replicate the Splatfest Tee, but it comes with the Ability Doubler and changes color to reflect the player's ink color.
</li><li> Also in <em>Splatoon 2</em>, Marina develops a custom arena known as Shifty Station, which changes every time a new Splatfest rolls around. Some players lament that you cannot revisit these stages when the Splatfest ends, as some of them have gimmicks that make the stage far more entertaining than the usual fare. As of version 5.0.0, all 24 Shifty Stations have been permanently added to the game, but they're only available in private Splatfest battles rather than the main rotation.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlugDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlugDefense">Metal Slug Defense</a></em> has event units who are available to purchase within a certain version.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlugAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlugAttack">Metal Slug Attack</a></em>, units and special item parts that are received through the Extra Ops, Pack-Shop, and pre-acquisition become unavailable once the event is over. Starting around November 2016, some Pack-Shop units replaced a majority of other units in the Medal Crank. Pre-acquisitions would return in a few weeks after debuting, and they are placed in the Medal Cranks and/or in the various shops. In a later update, old Extra Ops unit parts can be farmed for or purchased in the Another Story mode. Old United Front and Try-Line units can be obtained when their respective Extra Ops returns in the month (except for the most recent ones).

<ul><li> This happened to original, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>-inspired design of the Lead Dancer Zombie some time in late 2009. Understandably, some fans of both MJ and <em>PvZ</em> refuse to update their copy for this exact reason after learning that Popcap refused to cave in to the demand of MJ's foundation to give them a cut of the game's profits and instead opted to replace the old design with a generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscoDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscoDan">disco-themed</a> one.
</li><li> <em>Plants vs. Zombies Adventures</em> on Facebook was closed down for good on October 12, 2014 due to not being very popular. This meant all your hard-earned stuff on that game was lost forever.

Here's hoping you didn't pay actual money for virtual items in a game that has been discontinued.

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> servers were shut down in 2014, leaving games with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> missing quite a lot of content.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlaystationHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlaystationHome">PlayStation Home</a></em>:
<ul><li> Some spaces will be taken down for one reason or another, meaning that the items within can never be obtained again.
</li><li> Some items can only be obtained during limited-time events. If you don't get them then, you usually won't have another chance.
</li><li> Home itself was shut down on March 31, 2015. Since there is no way to access items/spaces offline, users lost everything.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2016">HITMAN (2016)</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman2">both</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hitman3">sequels</a> feature Elusive Targets. Elusive Targets are only available for a certain period of time before being removed. What's more, you can only play these missions <em>once</em>. After you successfully assassinate them or die during the mission, you cannot replay these missions (unless you've disconnected from the game's servers and your progress doesn't get logged).
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaDreamcast">Sega Dreamcast</a>, known as the first online console ever, had its own internet browser as well as games with exclusive content only downloadable by this system (the prime example is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue">Shenmue</a> Passport</em>). Being this console discontinued since 2001-2002, this online system shut down and all the possible content <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">is now history</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vocaloid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vocaloid">Vocaloid</a></em>: Despite LOLA, LEON, and MIRIAM all being removed from sale, it was still possible to buy a downloadable link until November 2015. MIRIAM was the only one of the three to have all her serial codes had been sold at that point, making it currently impossible to purchase her.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BluRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BluRay">Blu-ray</a> discs with "BD-Live" content, which require downloading files from off a server to function and which could (and inevitably will) be taken offline, often without any warning.
</li><li> Due to the closure of Nintendo's Miiverse service on November 7, 2017 at 10 P.M. PT, it is impossible to unlock all of the Workshop items in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioVsDonkeyKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioVsDonkeyKong">Mario vs. Donkey Kong</a>: Tipping Stars</em>, since the built-in 88 levels obviously do not produce enough stars to get everything available.
</li><li> Exclusive games downloaded from either The Sega Channel on the Genesis, or Satellaview on the SNES. Your only chance of playing these at this point is through emulation, as both services are dead and buried, and neither Sega or Nintendo have any interest in re-releasing them in any form, and the only chance of retrieving these is through dumping the storage media of the Satellaview or Sega Channel Adapter respectively while the games are not yet deleted. Needless to say, a number of games on both services remain irrecoverable and lost forever.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> game <em>Buzz: Quiz World</em> has a trophy for starting the game from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlaystationHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlaystationHome">PlayStation Home</a></em>. Seeing as the latter game has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefunctOnlineVideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefunctOnlineVideoGames">shut down</a>, if you don't already have the trophy you'll never be able to get it.
</li><li> The Wii Shop Channel discontinued the ability to add Wii Points for purchasing games as of Mar 26, 2018, and the channel itself shut down on Jan 30, 2019. Any game that you didn't download before then is gone for good with no way to get it back. Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> was delisted from the Wii Shop Channel when Konami's license for the IP ran out, so anyone who didn't get to buy the game before that were out of luck.
</li><li> The shutdown of GameSpy in 2014 resulted in the loss of online functionality for all games that utilized it, save for those that were migrated to third-party servers.
</li><li> The most salient point critics of the download-only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PSP Go</a> raised about its lack of a UMD drive was what owners were supposed to do about games that for whatever reason were no longer listed on the PlayStation Store. The answer, obviously, is that they're screwed as far as getting a legit copy is concerned; these games can still be had with an unauthorized firmware update and quick internet search, but there's no way to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepCirculatingTheTapes">obtain copies by legally paying for them anymore</a>.
</li><li> This also raises concern of how the contents of PlayStation and Xbox digital downloads are handled. While some games are taken down in per-title basis, games for legacy platforms may, someday, no longer be supported due to the necessary shutdown. This has been partially alleviated by Microsoft's attempt to update Xbox 360 and original Xbox games by making them backwards compatible with the Xbox One.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Neopets">Neopets</a></em> has had a few assorted features removed over the years, causing them and any related unlockables (such as Neoboards avatars) to become this. These range from minor things such as the Tooth Faerie avatar and the corresponding Random Event which granted it (inadvertently lost in the shuffle when Random Events were revamped in 2014), to major things such as the entirety of Neopets Mobile (pre-smartphone era mobile app), Key Quest (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a>-esque virtual board game) and Petpet Park (a now-defunct spinoff site). The removal of Key Quest in particular was met with a large outcry from fans, both due to it having been a fun and practical way of earning Neopoints and items, and due to it having had alternate pieces players could use via purchasing them with real money; the latter are still viewable in a player's collection, but are unusable due to the game no longer existing.
</li><li> Many modern <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tamagotchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tamagotchi">Tamagotchi</a></em> toys have had certain items and characters that are only unlockable via a website or, in Japan, an arcade machine or cell phone game, and become unavailable once the method for unlocking them becomes unavailable.
<ul><li> The Tamagotchi Music Star had exclusive items that are required to unlock certain characters. Obtaining these items required you to visit the Tamatown website, which is no longer active as of 2013, to earn points to buy the items and transfer them to your Music Star toy.
</li><li> There are certain characters on the Tamagotchi 4U, among them Miraitchi and Clulutchi, that could only be obtained via limited-run events in Japan involving a special NFC touchpoint.
</li><li> The Tamagotchi m!x and Meets have marriage partners that can only be found in stations scattered across Japanese stores and cycle through different characters depending on the season.
