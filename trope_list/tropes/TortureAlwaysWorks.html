The information extracted under torture is always accurate and important, even if the interrogator himself starts with no information at all and so has no way to know if the prisoner is telling the truth or lying. The possibility of having the wrong person, who will say <em>anything</em> under torture <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterrogatedForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterrogatedForNothing">whether they know anything or not</a>, will be excluded. Often as not, the victim is then released with no consequences to them if they lied.

When characters object to torture, they are often portrayed as weak <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">liberal Strawmen</a> who "don't have what it takes" or "don't realize what's at stake". They only make moral criticisms, and never bother to point out that it's unreliable, presumably because they too know that it Always Works. Even when it doesn't work, characters who should know better assume that it will.
</p><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, as an interrogation technique for extracting actual usable intelligence, its efficacy varies wildly — some will tell the truth, others will lie either to spite their torturers or to take revenge on someone by casting them under suspicion to be tortured, others will clam up under poor treatment. It's also been found that because torture is so exhausting victims are sometimes unable to even remember the information their torturers want. Perhaps the greatest problem is that many people will say ANYTHING to make the torture stop. This means false confessions that resemble whatever sort of information the torturer wanted to get. For investigative purposes this result is basically useless but can make the torturer more confident in the technique since it appears to have worked. This plays into another issue which is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">true statements may be ignored</a> because the torturer knows what kind of information they expect to get. So the torture continues until the victim is able to come up with a sufficiently convincing lie. Indeed, the fact that people do lie when tortured into a confession is one reason why this isn't generally accepted evidence in courts.

<div class="indent"><strong>Havoc:</strong> [Talking to Hei] If you've <em>really</em> established a Contract, you'd know better than anyone else.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Film — Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>, Smith tortures Morpheus for the codes to Zion's mainframe. The fact that they've given him a digital truth serum that is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindProbe">hacking his mind</a> does help.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyHarry">Dirty Harry</a></em>, San Francisco Police Department Inspector "Dirty" Harry Callahan presses down on the Scorpio killer's badly wounded leg (he was just shot with a .44 revolver) until he tells him where to find a girl he had kidnapped and left to suffocate. Naturally, he finds out where she is, only to discover that she has already died. The killer promptly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality">walks away from the law</a> by crying "police brutality", much to Harry's disgust. However, in fact there was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw">more evidence they could have used against him</a> than just his confession.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnight">The Dark Knight</a></em>, Batman uses it on a mob boss by dropping him from two stories up (conventional Batman interrogation techniques involve dangling the perp from twenty or thirty stories up until he talks) and breaking his legs. This works a bit better. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Except it still doesn't work</a>. The mob boss still doesn't tell him anything, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMobBossIsScarier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMobBossIsScarier">he's way more scared of the Joker than anything the Batman could do to him</a>. This calls to mind earlier, when Batman had the Joker in custody, and Joker himself told Batman that he could wail on him all day, and he'd still never tell him anything until he decided he wanted to. This is in stark contrast to Batman's very effective use of torture in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, who determines information about the growing conspiracy from crooked cop Flass, and finds out that Dr. Crane/Scarecrow is working for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ra's Al Ghul</span>. This is part of the more mature theme of <em>The Dark Knight</em>.
<ul><li> The Joker even gives the Batman tips on how to beat someone up while Batman is pounding him. Batman begins by slamming Joker's head against the table, which the Joker says is a poor way to start, since it makes the victim too dazed to feel any further injury. Which is immediately proven: Batman smashes Joker's hand, which Joker <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">no-sells</a> and says, "See?"
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transsiberian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transsiberian">Transsiberian</a>.</em> Kolzak tortures Abby to find out where her boyfriend Carlos is. She legitimately doesn't know, however. He then tortures her in front of her acquaintances, Roy and Jessie, thinking that seeing Abby in agony will cause one of them to talk. Jessie, who know exactly where Carlos is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> dead, by her hand</span>, is visibly disturbed during the scene. She breaks down, seems as though she's going to crack, and then lies again. Badly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePunisher2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePunisher2004">The Punisher (2004)</a></em>: The Punisher himself hangs a guy from the ceiling in chains, cooks a steak with a blowtorch behind the guy's back (sound and smell of sizzling meat) while running a popsicle along his back, explaining that burning usually feels like freezing to start. It works.
<ul><li> The chief benefit of this is the fact that it's a complete psych out. That said, the film never explores how far Frank would actually have gone. By contrast, a later torture scene involving Quintin Glass and Frank's next door neighbor subverts the trope; Glass gets nothing, in spite of removing every piece of the man's extensive body piercings the hard way.
</li></ul></li><li> Slightly ambiguous in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>, but seems to indicate that even if torture did work, would that really justify its use?
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfJoanOfArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePassionOfJoanOfArc">The Passion of Joan of Arc</a></em>. They drag Joan to the torture room but she simply explains to them the logic listed in the description above.
</li><li> In the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Payback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Payback">Payback</a></em>, Mel Gibson's character willingly submits to being tortured just so he could feed his torturers false information. (They wouldn't believe him if he just told them before the torture)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ActOfValor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ActOfValor">Act of Valor</a></em> deliberately subverts this. When a CIA agent is captured by the drug traffickers in the film, she is brutally tortured but utterly refuses to break under the pain. Later on, when Christo, the leader of the drug traffickers, is captured and questioned by Miller, the interrogation consists entirely of the two men sitting at a table and talking, with Miller simply laying out the reality of the situation: Christo will be going to prison, and unless he cooperates, he will likely never see freedom or his family again.

Torture was involved in getting some of the information about his associates. This spurred a lot of controversy and accusations that the film is pro-torture. Yet torture is also clearly shown as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">ineffective</a> in preventing an attack, as the prisoner is reduced to gibberish and any worthwhile information either came from non-torture interrogation and overlooked files, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">director</a> said in an interview that the moral ambivalence of the use of torture was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">intentional</a>.

The father of a woman tortured into confessing to "Judaizing" (refusing pork, and thus supposedly indicating she secretly practices Judaism), brings the Inquisitor who arrested her home for dinner. He questions him on the effect of torture. The Inquisitor assures him that an innocent person will not confess falsely, because God would give them the strength to resist. The father and his sons then torture the Inquisitor into confessing he is a monkey, shaking his belief in the Spanish Inquisition's methods.

To be fair, they are <em>long-term</em> torturers, in that they "break" a target over weeks or months so that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">want to obey their Mistress</a>, who have been trained since girlhood. They're less a method of gaining information and more a method of making someone into a slave. Hell, they don't even ask any questions until they're sure that their victim is properly "trained."
<ul><li> The grimmest part of the whole scenario is that Mord-Sith start out as kind, gentle girls and are systematically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">tortured and broken</a> until they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil">ready, willing, and able</a> to do it to others.

</li><li> Both subverted and played straight later in the series. A corrupt UN-Earth Admiral makes it clear that under torture a man will say anything. However, the terrorist chief who has captured him reminds him that this includes the truth. Extra points are awarded when the Legion tricks an Amnesty Interplanetary investigator into taping them brutally interrogating several prisoners with mock hangings and blow torches, then storming into her press conference to reveal that everyone in her tape was actually a Legionary soldier and the whole thing was one big set up.
</li><li> At the same time, the said Legion operates a ship where captured terrorists are subjected to horrific procedures, from dental drilling, to finger breaking, to sex change operations over a period of months to get them to give information.

A lot of people try to convey how ruthless and dangerous the villain is by pointing out that "he has a man in the dungeon who can keep you alive for <em>years</em>". While this would imply extensive torture so refined that even dying from it isn't an option, the protagonists usually interpret it literally and ask if it involves jogging and a balanced diet.
<ul><li> The torture skills of the Quisition in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SmallGods">Small Gods</a></em> is equally remarked upon. In this case, though, whether or not the victim is actually in possession of important information or is a heretic is considered ultimately unimportant. They figure that simply being suspected of something is sufficient evidence of wrongdoing, since surely the Great God Om would not allow suspicion to fall on an innocent. Sound familiar?

Her reaction to all this? Irritation that her captors are such amateurs because she told them everything she knew immediately, knowing that with the drugs they were using nobody could keep a secret. And as a highly trained courier she is more important than any information she might be carrying on any single trip. Plus, she finds it distressing that they are dumb enough to actually rape her (and several other highly unpleasant things) when they should know that her training allows her to deal with it, making it useless for torture purposes.

After Brutus' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>, Julius realizes he has to keep the lid on what has happened and make use of the fact that no one ever believed Brutus would betray him, as well as keep an eye on Brutus so that he knows how much he reveals to Pompey. So he lets people believe that Brutus is actually working as a spy, knowing that this is what Pompey is suspecting, and then he selects a soldier to go as a second spy. He purposely selects a clumsy, non-discreet soldier in the hopes that he <em>will</em> be captured and tortured, in which case he'll reveal the truth as he knows it - that Brutus hasn't betrayed Caesar but is his spy. Julius does show a lot of agony over having to go through with the plan, but feels he has no other choice.
</li><li> <em>The Cure</em> by Sonia Levittin. It's an open secret that the torturers can get anyone to confess to anything if given enough time, and they apparently don't care whether the confessions are true as long as they match what they're fishing for. (What they're fishing for, incidentally, is a confession that the Black Death is the result of Jews poisoning wells, and that every Jew above the age of seven is in on it. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BasedOnATrueStory">Based on a True Story</a> of a town that massacred all its Jews on such a pretext.)

Partly because it doesn't work, but also because the drug "Fast Penta" works quicker and more reliably. (It is easily obtained, makes those who take it amiable enough to answer any questions and ensures perfect recall. The only immunity is a fatal allergic reaction. (Which most of the people who know sensitive information have, as it can be artificially induced.)) (Or, if you are Miles, having an atypical reaction.) Most of the torture that occurs is motivated by pure sadism and insanity (<em>Shards of Honor</em>, <em>Mirror Dance</em>) and the victims have extensive issues years later (Mark Vorkosigan, Bothari, Elena Visconti). Of course, the existence of Fast Penta doesn't stop people from occasionally wistfully wondering if it's time to start yanking fingernails when the drug won't work.
</li><li> Played straight and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em>.

Once said agent was captured, the sensory deprivation method wasn't used due to his health, so instead they used other methods that weren't as harmful to physical condition. Ultimately, he did break, though it took a lot longer than the KGB had planned. The designer of the "new technique" muses that the old methods had more to do with satisfying the sadism of the interrogators than with getting accurate information.

After being captured by a general of the Khalsa, Flashman is told that he will be tortured for information, with the rationale being that a man as brave is he will only give up what he knows after he's been driven out of his mind with pain. However, not only does Flashman not have any information, he is also an utter coward, and so he breaks down into a terrified wreck at the mere thought of physical pain. Unfortunately, such is his reputation for heroism that his captor assumes he's putting on an act in order to avoid giving up what he knows, and begins torturing him anyway

</li><li> A running theme in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceFlynn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VinceFlynn">Mitch Rapp</a> books is that, contrary to the protestations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanPolitical">politically correct liberals</a>, torture works consistently and gives reliable information.

When Kasper Gutman uses the threat of torture in order to coerce Sam Spade to divulge the whereabouts of the Falcon, Sam responds that torture is only effective if the tormentor is ready at some point during the torture to go all the way and kill the victim; Gutman cannot afford to kill Sam since he is the only person knowing the bird's location and Sam knows that Gutman knows that etc... Which is not quite true since many torture techniques are very painful and specially designed to keep the victim alive for an indefinite amount of time.

This is despite the fact that during the Civil War, Gletkin was captured by the enemy, and they tied a lighted candlewick on to his shaven skull, but he didn't confess. When this is brought up to him, Gletkin counters that this was only because they didn't have enough time to torture him, as he was rescued a few hours later.

She uses the Cruciatus curse on Hermione, but Hermione is still able to lie that the sword they have is a fake. Bellatrix does have the presence of mind to double-check by bringing a goblin she was holding captive to verify this, but Harry gets the goblin to go along with the story.

He points out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureIsIneffective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureIsIneffective">Torture Is Ineffective</a> if you're just fishing for information, as you've no idea what's true and what's being made up to make the pain stop. However for specific information that you can verify once you have it, it's very effective.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Revolution">Revolution</a></em> many characters, but especially Sebastian "Bass" Monroe use torture to get information extremely quickly from any captured villain or lesser character. Miles, however, is shown to be resistant to torture as he is the resident badass.
</li><li> Jack Bauer of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> fame is this trope's clear champion. The over-effectiveness is lampshaded in the comedic "Jack Bauer Facts" that circulate the internet: "Jack Bauer once forgot where he put his keys. He then spent the next half-hour torturing himself until he gave up the location of the keys."
<ul><li> In fact, a major theme of Day 7 was how torture was necessary because it's so effective and apparently nothing else ever works. In fact, when someone he's interrogating starts saying anything Jack wants to hear, Jack specifies someone who has been in the business as long as him learns to tell when someone is speaking under duress, telling the truth or will never break. He tells the guy off for pretending and states he knows he's dealing with the kind of guy who will cough up the truth under torture. Jack, being Jack, is right (although he's stopped from completing the interrogation by people who believe torture is never acceptable).
</li><li> Despite this, torture never, ever works when used on Bauer himself. Yet he still firmly believes in it. Funny how nobody ever points this out.
</li><li> Averted in Day 8. Bauer tortures a Russian sniper, going much farther and being far more brutal than ever before, but fails to gain the information he wants. He discovers that the intel is inside the Russian's cell SIM card. Then again, Jack guts the Russian to get the chip. However, for once, it <em>wasn't</em> treated as if the moral of the story is "the crueler the better, it always gets you what you need." Jack had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> by this point and it was used to show how far off the deep end it was going.
</li><li> Also, the <em>Live Another Day</em> miniseries has Jack rule out breaking someone that way on multiple occasions and has had to get information in smarter ways. By the last episode, torturing someone into giving you information had yet to happen even once.
<ul><li> Most shockingly, <em>Live Another Day</em> subverts it at one point as Jack starts to torture the injured daughter of a villain... and suddenly backs down, humbly admitting that he was just doing it out of spite and knew she wasn't going to talk.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Bennet in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em> tortures information out of a captive with a rather creative and sadistic threat. It works because the victim knew (or at least was convinced) that Bennett would carry out his threat later on if the information proved to be wrong.
<ul><li> Subverted in Volume 5, when Bennett's love interest Lauren, a CIA agent, says that torture never works. She eventually convinces Bennet to coax rather than torture information out of Carnival member Edgar.

Other characters torture, but for some reason it never works—even untrained computer geeks can stand up to enemy intimidation...but even hardened agents are putty in Jack's hands. He doesn't use it often, but he is particularly inventive when he does so, which is possibly why he's so effective. Taking the cake is a scene where he stops the heart of someone who gave him false information through asphyxiation...then brings him back with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalDefibrillator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalDefibrillator">Magical Defibrillator</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em>, Rygel once tortured a Charrid to death and managed to extract some valid information from him. But he was more in it for the sadism anyway, since his race was devastated by a Charrid invasion attempt.
<ul><li> Also, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Scorpius'</a> ex-girlfriend Natira tortures a captured mercenary by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">ripping one of his eyeballs out and apparently eating it.</a> Quite naturally, the mercenary begins confessing, though Scorpius' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">ability to detect lies</a> helped a lot.

Michael tortures absolutely accurate but borderline useless information out of an assassin sent after him during the first season by poisoning his food with peanuts that the assassin was fatally allergic to. As the assassin painfully chokes to death, Michael dangles his medicine just out of reach until the assassin eagerly reveals everything he knows to Michael, which isn't much (he was hired by old enemies who want Mike dead now that the CIA is no longer protecting him, which has little bearing on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> and is something Mike already expected). This is the only time in the series that physical torture even slightly works, even when performed by protagonists: Michael has notably gotten better information on occasion by letting <em>himself</em> be tortured.
</li><li> Appears a few times on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rome">Rome</a></em>. Under the Roman legal system, testimony from slaves could only be accepted in court if it was extracted through torture.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>: The flashbacks of the Ben/Sayid torture episode, <em>One Of Them</em>, saw Sayid successfully torture a former superior officer of his to get the location of US soldiers. He used pliers to great effect it seemed.
<ul><li> He also prepared to torture more Others in <em>The Glass Ballerina</em>, telling Sun he would capture two of them and kill the rest. Sun asked why he would take two and Sayid replied: "One to make the other cooperate." Badass mofo.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita">La Femme Nikita</a></em>, Section One used torture constantly - and always with effective results. This provided a precursor to Jack Bauer's methods, as <em>Nikita</em> was produced by the same team that later created <em>24</em>.
</li><li> Used on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> - Buffy's interrogation subjects are usually demons, whose loyalties are extremely weak. Once she has someone at her mercy, it rarely takes more than a minute for them to start talking.
</li><li> Played with in an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>. Angel is tortured, and doesn't reveal what the bad guy wants. However, it's revealed afterwards that he was THIS close to do it, but the gang saved him before that point. It is also (possibly) justified, since they hint that the torturer has some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingLieDetector">lie detecting ability</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jericho">Jericho</a></em> when Hawkins says torture is great for getting answers, but the fear of torture is better for getting the truth. He even lampshades this trope, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">saying actual torture only works in the movies</a>.
</li><li> Played straight again and again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheShield">The Shield</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Vic Mackey</a> and his Strike Team frequently torture suspects before arresting them to get useful information. This can range from simply pointing a gun at the suspect or beating them to stabbing them with a badge pin or drowning them in oil. The perps always know exactly what the cops want to find out, they always give in and reveal the details, and they never attempt to give misleading information or tell outright lies. Could be partially justified because Mackey has a fearsome reputation and is likely to track down and punish anyone who tries to play him, but it even works in situations where the suspect ought to be more scared of the people he is betraying, or where he is about to leave town never to be seen again.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scandal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scandal">Scandal</a></em>, Huck manages to successfully torture information out of a captive even though he keeps the guy's mouth duct-taped shut until after he's past the point of being able to form coherent words.
<ul><li> On the other hand when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Huck himself</span> is captured the torture fails because they can't break him and he doesn't know anything anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in an episode from the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NewTricks">New Tricks</a></em>. The team has the suspect in custody, are applying various amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpSweating">Perp Sweating</a> to get him to confess, and it appears he is ready to crack, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when the trope is subverted by the sudden arrival of the suspect's attorney. The suspect had secretly used his his mobile phone to call his attorney, who was able to listen to - and record - everything that was going on.</span>
</li><li> Played straight, once, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>: When his daughter Alexis is abducted, Castle and Beckett track down one of the kidnappers.

Castle takes a deep breath, at which point we cut to Beckett's face as she hears the kidnapper's cries of agony from the other room. In the next scene, they are back at the precinct, having all the information they need. This in contrast to torturing Ryan and Esposito being completely useless in an earlier episode. So in the <em>Castle</em>-verse, Torture Always Works when a protagonist does it?
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrisonBreak">Prison Break</a></em>, General Zavala becomes the new head of the prison guards at Sona. Unlike his predecessor, he isn't corrupt and believes Michael Scofield about Gretchen Morgan being a criminal. Zavala has Gretchen tortured and, while that doesn't reveal any information at first, concludes that her behavior and composure indicates that this isn't her first time being tortured, confirming that she isn't who she claims. Later, she pretends to break and agrees to take them to a safe house, only to surprise and kill the General and his escort.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed">Deconstructed</a> in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Chains of Command: Part Two," when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician">Gul Macet</a> captures Picard. The torture fails to retrieve any useful information-but it does succeed in humiliating and breaking Picard. Mostly Macet tries to make Picard say there are five lights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPlusTortureMakesFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoPlusTortureMakesFive">when in fact there are four</a>, which Picard later admits he was close to doing before being rescued, even briefly <em>seeing</em> them as five.

In his previous stint as a spy, Garak had been among other things a skilled torturer and is sent back into that role...but when assigned to torture his friend Odo for information about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Founders</a>, it's Garak who breaks. He desperately begs Odo to give him <em>any</em> information, even if it's a lie, so he can stop the torture and report it to his superiors.

Sharpe says he would never talk and is rebuked with:
<div class="indent"><em>"Don't be a fool, everyone talks on the third day."</em>
</div></li><li> Lampshaded and played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em>. Root needs answers from Shaw, and she notes that, statistically, torture only ever gets false answers or at the very least useless ones. That doesn't mean that she's <em>not</em> going to torture Shaw, because she <em>is</em> on a schedule.
<div class="indent"><strong>Root:</strong> You should know torture almost never produces good information. <em>(picks up hot iron)</em> Well... almost never. Sadly, we are on a bit of a clock.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>: Played with. When Jessica and Simpson capture one of Kilgrave's bodyguards, Simpson wants to pry his kneecap off with a knife to get him to talk, but Jessica points out that he's mind-controlled, so he won't say anything no matter what they do. The bodyguard then says that 1: He's not mind-controlled, and 2: He'll tell them whatever they want, so could they please put the knife away?
</li><li> Played with in the TV movie <em>Gulag</em> (1985). An American journalist is framed by the KGB as a spy, then subjected to interrogation in filthy cells, but this only makes him more angry and defiant. His interrogator states that he will be allowed visitors, so he's allowed to shower and shave and dress himself in clean clothes. Then a guard enters holding his previous filthy clothes and demands he put them back on as he's going back to his cell. The journalist suffers an immediate mental breakdown, and provides the fake confession. So torture was effective, but sometimes you have to be clever about it. And in this case confessing to something the accused didn't do was the idea.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AFrenchVillage">A French Village</a></em>: Müller regularly claims this to his victims before beginning, saying it's just a matter of time and technique before people talk. Generally it seems to be the case, but in one case he's thwarted when a captured Communist who's aware he has a weak heart dies after he'd held out.

</li><li> Subverted in one quest, in which torturing a quillboar gets him to reveal the name of his leader, but only because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllNeverTellYouWhatImTellingYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllNeverTellYouWhatImTellingYou">he's too stupid to avoid unintentionally blurting it out</a>, and offering him food or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TickleTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TickleTorture">tickling him</a> will also get him to give the information. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">the latter techniques actually work faster</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastOfUs">The Last of Us</a></em>, Joel gets information through torture twice. In both cases, he gets the information he needs quickly and easily.
<ul><li> The first time is justified, as he tortures one mook while keeping a second tied up to corroborate the information he receives, though in the end he doesn't bother to double-check and just kills both of them.
</li><li> The second time is more problematic: in a race against time to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> save Ellie from being killed for a vaccine</span>, he takes a gun from the guard who was escorting him from the building and demands to know where she is, shooting said guard when he remains quiet. The guard promptly tells him before Joel finishes him off with a shot to the head. Joel has zero means of verifying the information he is given and the information will be useless to him with just the slightest delay, yet he was able to get precisely the information he needed in the space of a few seconds of torture.

Most quickly swear that they could lead her right to you. However it is clearly a subversion as they are most likely saying this just to get the torture to stop. The informant all but confirms this but still warns Delsin to watch himself.

<ul><li> This was believed to be fact for most of Western history. Before the 1600s, torture was simply matter of factly used by courts for extracting confessions. It was believed that God would help a person resist torture if they were innocent, so false confessions were thought to be impossible. Even so, there were usually legal limits on its use. In England, torture was not used so frequently as on the continent, requiring the King or his Privy Council's consent. Law courts on the continent issued torture warrants based on sworn accusations commonly. The Inquisition actually had more limits on its use than the secular courts, ruling that torture could be used only once, though this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">gotten around</a> by "suspending" torture sessions and starting again later. Confessions under torture had to be repeated afterward in court (though the threat of further torture if the accused recanted made this empty). Witchcraft trials saw even these meager protections thrown out. Since witchcraft was the "crimen exceptum", even suspects managing to hold out and not confess under torture would not save them. Instead, it was said the Devil had aided them to resist, blithely ignoring the belief God would do so for an innocent person mentioned earlier. Not until into the 1600s would torture's effectiveness first be questioned. England banned torture in 1640. One story goes that a German prince whose domain had then seen a number of witch trials was concerned with the fantastic things accused witches had confessed under torture, and asked for the Jesuit Order to investigate. They did so, and reported that the practice was proper. Afterward the prince called the Jesuits into a torture chamber, where he brought them to a woman who had already confessed to witchcraft. The prince asked if the Jesuits were involved too. At first she denied it, but then immediately agreed they were when he threatened to have her tortured further. Astonished, the Jesuits became convinced of its failure. Father Frederich Spee, a Jesuit priest who acted as confessor to people convicted of witchcraft, also wrote a groundbreaking book, <em>Cautio Criminalis</em> (Precautions for Prosecutors) which noted torture's ability to produce false confessions and argued in favor of banning it, with accused witches having the same legal rights. Another was <em>On Crimes and Punishments</em> by Italian judge Cesare Beccaria, who also argued against capital punishment (again an innovative view). Many governments that use torture are now aware its efficacy for getting true confessions is dubious at best. For some, this has meant they prohibit the use of torture due it to being unreliable and cruel. Others, unfortunately, use it to gain confessions they <em>know</em> are false (used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">show trials</a> in many dictatorships) or simply to punish their dissidents. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> has seen a revival of torture being used by Western states, but the same criticisms of this have been made.
