</div></div><p>Amnesiac Dissonance occurs when a good or evil person suddenly remembers their past of the opposite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">alignment</a>. This becomes the epitome of Man versus Himself (or Herself) as the values and memories of their past self collide with their current self. This can result in a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, or give a shade of grey to the character that they didn't possess before. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a> can be substituted as a type of spiritual amnesia.

<ul><li> Happens several times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AngelSanctuary">Angel Sanctuary</a></em>, subverted with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Setsuna and Sara: Setsuna regains some of Alexiel's memories but manages to maintain his identity as a separate person from her, and Sara never regains any memories of her life as Gabriel</span> but played agonizingly straight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kira.</span>
</li><li> For the first two seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodPlus">Blood+</a></em>, Saya goes through this after meeting Haji, and starts to remember when she went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">berserk</a> in Vietnam and older memories.
</li><li> Villetta Nu of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> goes through this when her battlefield injuries leave her amnesiac. One of the enemy, Kaname Ohgi, takes her in, conceals her past from her, and keeps her hidden from his comrades. Slowly, she grows infatuated with him...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until her memories resurface and she shoots him with his own gun before rejoining her old allies. In spite of this, Ohgi risks his life to confess his love to her, and in the end, Villetta is able to reconcile her identities and marry him.</span>
<ul><li> Happens to Lelouch in the side story <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassAkitoTheExiled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeassAkitoTheExiled">Code Geass: Akito the Exiled</a></em> as Julius Kingsley. While Lelouch absolutely <em>hates</em> the Empire and all it stands for, and is a genuine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> underneath his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">The Chessmaster</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> actions, Julius is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who sees no problem with killing civilians to win a war and is utterly loyal to the Emperor. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The last fact is a major reason for the breakdown of that false personality as it's so against Lelouch and who he is.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a></em>, Nagi seems to be a perfectly friendly, polite and kind-hearted widower, whose only wish is to see his child outside of prison. Turns out that's not exactly the case. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">With the help of a bit of drugs and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a>, he remembers that when he was shown his unborn child's fetus in a test tube, he stewed over it for a week, then went and murdered twenty-two prison guards with his bare hands; he also recalls his general hatred for all of humanity. It's not a pretty moment.</span>
</li><li> Inverted and averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Protagonist Light gives up his memories of being the mass-murderer "Kira", then his mind wiped self tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName">clear his name</a> by joining a task force devoted to capturing Kira. Although he still keeps his intelligence and <em>says</em> that his thought patterns are similar to Kira's, his personality changes to that of a decent person rather than the self-righteous, prideful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> he was before that would be willing to use the Death Note. Even if he doesn't sympathize with Kira because he wants to clear his name, the personality change was the series' only notable headache. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But when he gets his memories back, there's no dissonance - just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoticSmirk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoticSmirk">Psychotic Smirk</a>. Everything that happened went "Exactly as planned."</span>
<ul><li> A jarring difference is the way he treats Misa. While he was perfectly happy to seduce and manipulate her when they first met, amnesiac Light vigorously opposes L's efforts to do the same.
</li><li> Light confronts a troubling question: <em>could</em> he actually be Kira? To answer this question to his satisfaction, he must contemplate: <em>could</em> he, <em>would</em> he ever use the Death Note? Would he kill another person? After genuine, intense introspection, Light reaches a conclusion — No. He would not and could not. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">He is wrong</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>. From all the adventures the main characters had in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">the first series</a>, everyone thought that our main hero Goku was just a human with ridiculous strength, a monkey tail, and the ability to turn into a giant ape. Just a coincidence right? Wrong! In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Goku's long-lost brother, Raditz, shows up from outer space to reveal that he isn't human, but instead an alien from a ruthless warrior race sent to destroy every life on Earth. Raditz tries to convince him of this by kidnapping his only son and demanding Goku pile up 100 dead Earthlings, but it doesn't fly because Goku got his amnesia as an infant and thus doesn't remember his prior wilder side in the first place. It isn't until the Namek Saga that Goku acknowledges his Saiyan brethren in a positive light, by honoring the fallen Vegeta and representing his race by fighting their tyrannical oppressor, Frieza.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>, when Lucy loses her memories, she goes from being a violent mass murderer to an innocent, harmless and <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">child-like</a> Nyu.
</li><li> After Greed is captured in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, he is given complete amnesia by his creator Father. When confronted by a former companion, Greed kills the companion which causes memories to start resurfacing. One of the images he sees is King Bradley (who killed his three closest companions) and Greed attacks King Bradley's house before running away.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleAngelAlita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleAngelAlita">Battle Angel Alita</a></em>, Alita eventually discovers that she was a ruthless terrorist before her body was discovered in the Scrapyard at the beginning of the series. In fact, she's directly <em>responsible</em> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">dystopia</a> she'd been rebelling against.
</li><li> Though he didn't exactly turn evil, Sho in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Guyver">Guyver</a></em> had this happen in the infamous arc where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he killed his father after said father had been forcibly turned into a Guyver-killing Zoanoid that ripped out Sho's brain</span>. Notably, Sho was affected by this for some time: he built up a mental block about his powers that only subsided when his love of and duty towards Mizuki overruled his guilt.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> manga, Keiichi falls asleep, and forgets he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kills Mion and Rena.</span> He wakes up quickly and sees the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">bloody sight.</span> This is not in the anime or sound novels, though.
<ul><li> One example that did occur in all adaptations is when in a later arc, Keiichi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">recalls said act, which he forgot by virtue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">not living in the world in which it occurred.</a></span>
</li><li> Although he wasn't so much "Amnesiac" as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an alternate dimensional self.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KannazukiNoMiko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KannazukiNoMiko">Kannazuki no Miko</a></em>: This happening to Chikane is the reason for her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except that she never turned to begin with. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">You Can't Fight Fate</a>.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Magical Project S</a></em>, Sasami's friend Misao has the split personality of Pixy Misa created by Rumia. Since she has no memories of being Pixy Misa, she's completely clueless. Pixy Misa seems to be aware of being Misao, though, and the series often plays this up for laughs, such as when Pixy Misa tricks Sasami into believing she's "kidnapped" Misao (by using a giant screen to cover her transformations, all the while Misao is <em>completely</em> confused as to what's going on). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After Misao discovers that she's Pixy Misa and had been fighting her best friend all along, she has a mental breakdown over the conflicting personalities.</span>

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LiloAndStitchTheSeriesS1E12Amnesio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/LiloAndStitchTheSeriesS1E12Amnesio">Amnesio</a>", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">experiment of the week</a> erases peoples' memories. Lilo, Stitch, and Gantu all get zapped and try to reassemble their pasts together; they don't come up with much that's conclusive about Lilo or Stitch, but reckon Gantu must have been a cop. So they become very good friends, and don't worry all that much about their memories until Lilo learns that there's a way to reverse the effect, and learns the codeword. Gantu, meanwhile, has learned that he was not a very nice guy. He's quite vehement that he doesn't want to go back to being a jerk—until Lilo says the codeword, <em>ʻohana</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckyTranslation">What are the odds Jumba would pick the Hawaiian Earth word for "family"?</a>), anyway. He ten remembers the one bit of context his amnesiac self didn't, viz. he loves being a jerk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: in the episode "The Fool Monty" Mr. Burns gets amnesia and acts genuinely nice, until Lisa takes him to his mansion here he remembers his true identity.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Action Figures", villainous cyborg Metallo turns up on a volcanic island with no memory of himself; he saves a young girl's life and does other good deeds, but eventually he remembers his battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> and turns evil again.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>: When Shredder gets amnesia the first thing he does is save a man's life, making it seem like this trope is being put into effect, but it turns out his evil instincts are still there when he finds the idea of building an explosive so he can use it to hold the city hostage fun.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em> (the sequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>), Megatron had brainwashed two of the Maximals and given them entirely new identities. Upon recovery, Silverbolt became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">The Atoner</a>, and Rhinox decided to stay evil and competed with Megatron.
<ul><li> Also from Transformers, the character Flip Sides from both G1 and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, is a decepticon who has a double-life as an Autobot—in G1 she's a teacher, in Animated she's a pop star. The catch is, while she's an autobot, <em>she does not know or realize that she is a decepticon spy</em>. Talk about conflicting moralities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>: The god <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Iop</span> eventually renounced his power and memories, starting a new life as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sadlygrove</span>. Though both are heroes, the former was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">a neglectful father</a> to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goultard</span>, while the latter had become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyMan">incredibly devoted to his wife and children</a> by the time he discovered his origins. He ends up feeling guilty, not only for how his previous identity treated his son, but because he fears he has numerous lovers and children he doesn't even <em>know</em> about.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, the team wakes up in the Biyalian desert with their memories of the past six months erased. This turns Superboy into a mindless berserker (he's not even six months old), Kid Flash and Artemis start flirting with each other and even hold hands right before their memories are restored, and Artemis believes she is there because her father wants her to kill Kid Flash.
