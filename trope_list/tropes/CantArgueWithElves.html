</p><p>Oh, and they're <em>magic</em>.
</p><p>In fact, the only quality elves seem to be lacking is <em>humility</em>. Even when an author tries to specify that <em>these</em> elves are perfect, wonderful, etc., <em>and</em> humble, the elves still can't resist lecturing humans on their errant ways. Sometimes the elf will try a Socratic approach — asking, for example, why humans will kill each other, because of course elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe">never fight amongst themselves</a> — but they don't <em>need</em> to.

If anyone tries, the elf will sniff disdainfully and utterly destroy the human's argument, thus proving the elves right yet again. This trope is not limited to elves. Whenever you have a group that thinks itself as just completely superior to anyone else and ignores all arguments against it, you have this trope.
</p><p>There are no elves in real life, far as we know, but it is very prevalent in humanity with certain individuals and groups adopting this stance. Which individuals and groups? Take your pick, you may have seen such elves in online, political or religious discussion. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease">We're not actually looking to catalogue them, mind you.</a>

<ul><li> The Abh in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/CrestOfTheStars">Crest of the Stars</a></em> and its sequels, being essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Space Elves</a>, fits this trope perfectly, to the point that the Abh Empress can arrogantly proclaim to a group of human ambassadors that if they win the interstellar war that is brewing behind the scenes, there will be permanent peace within the galaxy because there will no longer be any more petty disputes amongst humans that can escalate into all-out war. And then the trope is subverted by the other half of the humanity (notoriously, Abh <em>do not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProHumanTranshuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProHumanTranshuman">consider themselves a different race</a>) basically saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">Screw You, Elves!</a>", and going to war. Both societies are shown as seriously flawed, though Abh still come out as <em>less</em> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrite">hypocrites</a> somehow.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatGirl">Aisha</a> of the C'tarl C'tarl constantly brags about her species' superiority, and no one calls her out on it (partially because her species is <em>physically</em> superior). Then again, Aisha's the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> and is obviously immature, so this is most likely a case of "let the baby have the bottle" or acknowledging that she can take the abuse. It helps that Aisha is considered kind of bugnuts, even by C'tarl C'tarl standards, but Aisha tends to be the sign that they let the mask slip by letting her go out in public.
</li><li> This is why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ThoseWhoHuntElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ThoseWhoHuntElves">Those Who Hunt Elves</a></em> have to chase the elves down and forcefully strip them; asking nicely if any of them had any odd runes on their skin never got them anywhere.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The mutants in Marvel's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Universe</a> constantly talk about how genetically superior they are, and how it means they have a higher standard of behavior. On one occasion Professor X tells Cyclops that a certain instance of resentment is a human thing, and he is "pleased to say" Cyclops wouldn't understand. The ordinary human they are talking to at the time says not a word.
<ul><li> This is especially grating since in the Ultimate Universe practically every character save for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a>, including Cyclops, who many if not most readers consider to already be a douche <em>in the regular continuity</em>.
<ul><li> Plus, in the proper 616 universe, it's the Brotherhood of Mutants who go on about how mutants are genetically superior and their main point of conflict with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> is that the X-Men <em>don't</em> believe this. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>, of course, but that's how it normally is.)
</li></ul></li><li> What makes this especially ironic is that unlike the Main Marvel Universe of 616, the Ultimate Marvel mutants are <em>not</em> the result of evolution, they're actually a byproduct of the world governments attempting to replicate the Super Soldier Serum after WW2, which ended up screwing with the gene pool when the various failed super-soldier projects had kids of their own.
</li><li> As of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JonathanHickmansXMen">Jonathan Hickman's X-Men</a></em> in 2019/2020, they are <em>all</em> onboard with this, with only a very few exceptions (Wolverine, Jean, and possibly Scott are among them). This leads to unsettling sights like Exodus preaching about mutant superiority in a cult-like atmosphere with a specific devil figure - 'The Pretender' (Wanda Maximoff a.k.a. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScarletWitch">Scarlet Witch</a>). Oh, and he's preaching <em>to children</em>. As a whole, the representatives of the new mutant nation of Krakoa make no bones about the fact that they see themselves as the rightful inheritors of the Earth and are merely patiently waiting to become the dominant species (which going by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> projected birth-rates, will happen in the next 20 years or so). In the meantime, they will use their miracle drugs (derived from Krakoan plants) to essentially addict humanity - while they aren't addictive by themselves, medicines that can reverse mental degeneration and extend lifespans by about a decade mean that they'll soon have the world by the short hairs. In fact, they outright state it.
</li></ul></li><li> Both Marvel and DC's Atlanteans make frequent reference to how they "rule" most of the planet, making them clearly superior. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Aquaman">Aquaman</a> even proclaims the rest of the world's needs as below him because Superman has an entire Justice League to handle the surface, while Aquaman is responsible for 70% of the world all by himself. Nobody ever points out that the oceans have a population numbered in the millions at most, are 99% unoccupied, and have maybe a dozen supervillains to worry about.
<ul><li> Of course, Aquaman can communicate with <em>every living thing down there,</em> not just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApparentlyHumanMerfolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApparentlyHumanMerfolk">Apparently Human Merfolk</a>, so he counts them among his subjects.
</li><li> It's even worse in Marvel, where the Atlanteans are mostly extinct and have virtually no claim to any other ocean territory besides the Atlantic. Of course, very few people actually <em>like</em> Namor, and with the exceptions of Namora and Namorita, his subjects tend to be even less popular.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicIDW">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (IDW)</a></em>:
<ul><li> One example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">King Aspen and the deer</a>. While it's not to say the deer weren't definitely being victimized by the genuinely evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Well-To-Do</a> and his construction company demolishing their forest, the deer retaliate by invading (read: <em>destroying</em>) towns full of ponies for their land. Even after realizing the ponies were innocent, the deer continued <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">even though it hampered the ponies from aiding them</a> until they got what they wanted. While they <em>did</em> repair the damage they caused, they're never once called on their actions, and in the end, Princess Celestia <em>apologizes to them</em>.
</li><li> Downplayed, with Cassie the Kelpie in issue #23, who brainwashed the entire town of Ponyville and had them try to tear down a dam that some friends of hers were stuck behind, uncaring if this flooded all of Ponyville in the process. Although she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">Easily Forgiven</a>, Rainbow Dash at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">publicly call her out</a> over the fact that this whole mess could have been avoided if she'd simply <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">asked Twilight for help first</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The mini-series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvels">Marvels</a></em> takes the moral that the reason the baseline human population of the Marvelverse resents and protests against its superhuman members is that they're <em>jealous</em> of their inherent nobility and self-sacrifice, rather than the perfectly understandable fear of having what amounts to physical gods brawling in the street. They also apparently fear being "replaced" by mutants, despite the fact that every human being on Earth is already a mutant, and the only difference is whether or not their X-Gene is activated.
<ul><li> The "jealousy over inherent moral superiority" thing gets rather ridiculous once the various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Galleries</a>  which demonstrate quite clearly that "noble" superhumans are quite outnumbered by the less-than-noble ones.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly the Inhumans are often written as culturally posturing. As an isolationist civilization with similar powers to mutants, uplifted by advanced alien technology centuries before others, they're short on patience with humanity. Even as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> of their titles and allies in others, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnintentionallyUnsympathetic">abrasively standoffish</a>. This at least appears cultural, as Inhumans inherited this attitude from the imperialistic and xenophobic Kree and Inhumans raised outside of their culture don't act nearly as superior.
</li><li> The Echidna race in the pre-reboot continuity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie's Sonic the Hedgehog Comic</a>. They were isolationist even before the Floating Island came to be and are established as being the first animal race to evolve intelligence, making them the most advanced race on the planet. Under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenPenders">Ken Penders</a> in particular, they always acted superior to everyone else and were never really called out on it, especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilOfVagueness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilOfVagueness">the Brotherhood of Guardians</a>, who felt that anything that didn't directly concern the Floating Island wasn't their problem, even Robotnik taking over the rest of Mobius. It isn't until Ian Flynn replaced him as head writer that they finally do get called out for this, with Knuckles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">taking his father Locke to task over it</a> when he tries to call his son back to the Island while Knothole Kingdom is in the middle of a crisis and Knuckles wants to stay and help his friends.
</li><li> In the French Comic Book series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfesEtNains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfesEtNains">Elfes</a>, the White Elves are presented as better in every way to humans, having a peaceful civilization yet accomplished soldiers, being wiser as they do not exploit the world of Arran only for their own profit and do not kill each other for petty material gains. The third volumes notably portrays Fall, a White Elf, trusting a human and bringing him to the Isles of the White Elves as a tragic mistake leading to a massacre of the Elves.

They have no problem with burning entire planets, the humans in their military are basically an army of super-soldiers, and the weaker Covenant races have inexplicably become more badass. They also seem to have an endless supply of soldiers and warships, which doesn't make sense given that in the backstory there were two Covenant Civil Wars in the last forty years. This faction should be much weaker than it is. That aside, the Allied Species spend much of the story criticizing the Jedi and the Republic(with whom they happen to be in an alliance) in general, while their own flaws are never mentioned. The Allied Species are always right and the Jedi are always wrong.

The in-story justification is that their planet's ecosystem automatically regulates itself, meaning they don't think they have any need for things like modern technology, roads, clothing, and human education. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out the planet's ecosystem is actually <em>sentient</em>.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em> trilogy:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheDesolationOfSmaug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheDesolationOfSmaug">The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug</a></em> has Thranduil and the Wood-Elves. They're downright hostile, taking the Dwarves as prisoner indefinitely and confiscating all their belongings just for trespassing in Mirkwood. Thorin does get to literally argue with them, though; the Elves treat Goblins/Orcs even more summarily.
</li><li> Then in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheBattleOfTheFiveArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbitTheBattleOfTheFiveArmies">The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies</a></em>, Thranduil first tries to force the Dwarves to fork over some treasures he wants. Then after the Orcs attack, he decides to pull out after some fighting, which would mean abandoning the Humans and Dwarfs to be slaughtered. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">when called on it</a>, his answer boils down to, "And?"
</li><li> Through all of this, however, Thranduil is not necessarily depicted as <em>right.</em> He's right sometimes, but then so is Thorin, and Bard, and Bilbo, and Gandalf, and plenty of other non-elves. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> tendencies eventually lead to his son Legolas, the last person he cared about, leaving him.

Elrond's problem with humans is more personal than an expression of elven hauteur. He's still angry at humans — in the person of Isildur — for failing to throw the One Ring into Mount Doom when they (he) had the chance. Since that failure led directly to the problems that were being discussed at that very moment, his harsh words may have been more a moment of pique than anything else. His daughter wanting to leave her entire family to stay with a human man probably plays a big part in this. Most other elves seem far more relaxed about it. Elrond tends to be quite a bit more sullen and openly angry than the usual "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">preeningly superior haughtiness</a>" that this trope usually indicates, however.

<ul><li> The Elves of Christopher Paolini's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>. The protagonist Eragon, who <em>lives</em> with them for quite a while, doesn't seem to notice (and also <em>becomes</em> elven later on). The text makes it apparent that the elves are more in tune with nature, more logical, more attractive, more graceful, more physically capable, more intelligent, more magical, and even more <em>sexually liberated</em> than humans are. It runs so deep in this series that non-Elves will regularly point out their own inferiority to Elves (usually along the lines of "We're not as good as you elves at this, but we manage"). The Elf being spoken to always accepts this as indisputable fact, and never disagrees.
<ul><li> The most amusing part being that the author wrote them as losing to even the simplest tactical maneuvers of the setting's various big bads, with the fact that they've been on the ropes for most of a Millenium at the beginning of the series and the evil empire doesn't even bother going after them until they get a pet (human) dragon-rider demonstrating pretty thoroughly that they've <em>always</em> been that straight-up outclassed by the humans.
</li><li> They also have a malfunctioning aristocracy with dark-ages quality of life, with the lower classes literally starving when Eragon finds them because 'in tune with nature' apparently doesn't translate to 'competent with agriculture'. The human empire, meanwhile, operates at about Renaissance level, with a functional middle class and plenty of excess food to the point that famine is a non-issue. Sure, the leadership is nuts, but actually <em>less</em> nuts than the prior dragon-riders.
</li><li> Paolini seemed to have written himself into a corner: if the elves are always right, and the elves say the gods don't exist, then how does the dwarf god exist? He actually showed up to a coronation when asked and gave their choice the thumbs-up.
</li><li> Paolini seems to actually realize how all this worked out around book three and a few characters actually do argue with the Elves, it just takes a while for him to get there.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> uses this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, whose glamour produces a crushing inferiority complex in others. Readily averted by cats, bees, and any character that thinks like a witch (that is: very, very hard). Also by dwarves and trolls, whose instinctive reaction on meeting an elf is to bash it with something hard, heavy and/or sharp.
</li><li> The Houyhnhnms of Swift's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels">Gulliver's Travels</a></em> are about as bad as it gets. They aren't a magical race, but they fill this trope quite well. Then again, considering that Gulliver is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> who worships any backward race he encounters, there's much literary debate over whether the reader is actually expected to have such an adverse reaction to the Houyhnhnms and their hypocrisy.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MemorySorrowAndThorn">Memory, Sorrow and Thorn</a></em> books by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TadWilliams">Tad Williams</a>. The Sithi can't help coming up with subtle put-downs, condescending behavior, and reproaches about old injustices done to them by ancestors who have been dead for centuries. Their high-bred human allies mostly ignore them.
</li><li> In C.L. Wilson's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TairenSoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TairenSoul">Tairen Soul</a></em> books, the Fey are so self-righteous and brash that the "evil/stupid" humans are on the verge of cancelling their alliance. The strange thing is that the author is completely with the Fey on that. The author seems to think it is their natural right to be arrogant. The "good" humans are the ones who don't take offense at being treated with condescension.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a> rarely relies on this trope, but the Caamasi might count. They're basically a martyred race of pacifists who will fight if they must and are tirelessly moral. Still, they don't feature all that heavily, and most of them don't spend their page time lording it over other cultures. When other races try to hold them up as this for political reasons in <em>The Hand of Thrawn</em> the Caamasi get shouted down for disagreeing.

The first human protagonist, Kellen, does quickly come to admire elves and elven culture, and these elves are fairly varied and polite and, well, <em>human</em>, as elves go. He does take minor offense when an older elf telling him some ancient history implies that humans did something or other because it's a natural human failing. A later human protagonist on the same side flatly dislikes elves for their formality and their absolute perfectionist attitude, though since they're all fighting a war he tries to keep it under wraps. It's actually a saying in that 'verse that you can't win an argument with elves since they'll just change the subject.
</li><li> The Aurënfaie in Lynn Flewelling's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightrunner">Nightrunner</a></em> novels have this going on in spades. Longer lifespans (and thus perceived greater experience and wisdom) than humans. Check. Innate magical potential (all the more because human magical potential originates from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">cross-breeding</a> with them). Check. A language that is difficult for most humans to pronounce properly.

Check. Tendency to drag out any kind of decision making for a length of time that makes most humans want to give up and leave. Check.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">People</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> call humans "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticSlur">Mud Men</a>", and the few human characters they interact with never really call them out on it. Possibly because said humans (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Artemis</a>) tend to notice that the People are the ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMasquerade">hiding from the humans</a>, so what are they so proud of? Also because Artemis agrees that humans fight too much and ruin the ecosystem, the People's most common arguments.
</li><li> There's a rather interesting twist on this trope in Kathryn Lasky's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardiansOfGaHoole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GuardiansOfGaHoole">Guardians of Ga'Hoole</a></em> books, in which all the main characters are owls. The owls consider themselves superior to other birds because most other birds <em>don't regurgitate pellets</em>. The other birds never take offense.
<ul><li> Neither do the nest-maid snakes, who are defined entirely as servants to owl families.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R.

It very much depends on the Elf. Thingol starts out as a straight example, but the trope is totally averted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">Finrod</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Felagund</a>, who's prepared to risk his life to help out the son of his human friend/fellow warrior.
<ul><li> This is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> (to the extent that it even applies) once you read the backstory - the living Elves remaining in Middle-Earth by the time of The War of the Ring are the last survivors of a once-great race who have endured a series of rather catastrophic wars which basically ended their control of the land. As a result, the remainder are a) atypically intelligent, kind, and badass, and b) very much aware of their people's past failings. Basically, all the Elves you Could Argue With were killed or left Middle-Earth for good centuries ago.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, in which the Elves of Mirkwood (and King Thranduil in particular) act more like paranoid rednecks than untouchable paragons of greatness. They live in a dank forest overrun by giant evil spiders, kidnap and imprison the Dwarves for no good reason, and then throw a huge party and get so blackout drunk that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MainCharacters">Main Characters</a> are able to escape. In contrast, the Noldor of Rivendell are portrayed as wise and noble, but they also avert the trope by being friendly and gracious hosts.
<ul><li> Frodo himself in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Fellowship Of The Ring</a></em> gently mocks Gildor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAnswer">Non-Answer</a> to his question by coming up with a fake "proverb" that one can't ask an elf anything, because they say yes and no at the same time. Averted because Gildor himself thought it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyPrettyFunny">Actually Pretty Funny</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The gnomes of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gnomes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gnomes">Gnomes</a></em> faux field guide are quietly disapproving of humanity for the way we despoil nature, in comparison to their own ways. When the authors try to defend the human race, they are quickly embarrassed into stopping. This irritates many readers in regards to what is otherwise a very fine book, because the fact that the gnomes have one-thousandth our mass (and therefore require one-thousandth the resources to feed), can perfectly control their (already low) fertility, live for hundreds of years, can understand animal speech, and have access to <em>magic</em> probably makes it a <em>little easier</em> for them to live in harmony with Mother Earth, y'know? But they're never called out on this.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series has the centaurs who refuse to accept any sort of human dominion over themselves, and indeed even contact with humans is seen as a crime. Though it ends up being averted, as Hagrid, arguably the character who has the most contact with centaurs, regularly gets frustrated with them and considers them to have their heads in the clouds. Neither the narration nor other characters consider him wrong. In fact, Firenze, a centaur who is eventually banished for continued contact with humans, is treated as the most heroic and open-minded of his kind. Ironically, the only elves we do see in the series avert the trope entirely, as they have a psychological compulsion to serve their master's wishes.
<ul><li> Wizards themselves: they restrict contact with normal people, and consider the problems of the country they live in to be nothing to do with them. They are shown as superior (and arrogant because of it) all the time. However, this is ultimately averted. A recurring theme of the series is that wizard culture is heavily flawed, featuring casual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and a comically incompetent government. The one time a character does get to argue with wizards, it's the Prime Minister of the UK, who is bewildered at how badly they've been managing the war with Voldemort, and it's pretty clear that he's got a point.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekDestiny">Star Trek: Destiny</a></em> series features the Caeliar, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAliens">Sufficiently Advanced Aliens</a> who have evolved almost completely beyond the need for physical bodies, have no crime, poverty, or want, and are devoted completely to artistic and scientific pursuits. They have just enough respect for others' beliefs to not try to convince other races that the Caeliar's way is correct, but no amount of cajoling will convince them that the Caeliar's way is wrong.

Not a bad place to be, all things considered, but don't argue too much.

Naturally Barrayarans have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">other ideas</a>.
<ul><li> Betans can be kind of like this, everyone making a fuss about how morally superior they are. Mind you this is a planet whose GNP is based on weapons development and sex tourism.
</li><li> The Barrayarans themselves are this in matters of war, frequently dismissing other militaries for their supposed lack of discipline (and recruitment of women).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> the Qualinesti elves and especially the Silvanesti elves. Their common belief is that they are the chosen race of the god of good, Paladine (despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">failing in actually doing something good to the world</a>), they're the best in everything, and they blame humans for every single bad thing happened to Krynn, especially the Cataclysm and the return of the chromatic dragons. Oh, they're also so arrogant that they'll enslave their less advanced cousins, the Kagonesti. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They eventually pay for their hubris by losing their homelands (Silvanost's taken by minotaurs, while Qualinost is destroyed by a giant dragon)</span>.
<ul><li> What makes things worse is that, according to all lore on the setting, elves genuinely were created by the Gods of Good, led by Paladine. Then again, as has been noted, The Gods of Good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">really aren't that convincing at being forces of good</a>...
</li><li> Let's really be clear here: the awfulness of the elves can be summarized quite simply in the fact that <em>they caused the Cataclysm</em>. Elven bigots who served as councilors to the King-Priest were secretly goading him along the whole time, planning on basically using humans united by the King-Priest to exterminate first the creatures of Evil (goblinoids, ogres, etc)... and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">to wipe out fellow creatures of Good and Neutral who they found unpleasant</a>, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarves</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreWeirder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGnomesAreWeirder">gnomes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">Kender</a>. As we all know, this led to the destruction of the Old World. In fact, making things worse, the story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">Lord Soth the Death Knight</a> explicitly calls out that he was manipulated into abandoning his quest to <em>stop the Cataclysm</em> by three elven priestesses who were in on the conspiracy and, with typical elven arrogance, didn't believe the Gods of Good would actually agree to destroy the world to preserve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>. About the only silver lining is that at least those three priestesses found themselves damned to an eternity of torment as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurBansheesAreLouder">banshees</a> for their sins.
</li></ul></li><li> The antihero of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackVance">Jack Vance</a>'s <em>Green Magic</em> is a master of the Black and White Arts who discovers the existence of an even more powerful form of magic. He actually <em>does</em> argue with elves, or rather the sprites of the Green Plane, and makes himself such a nuisance to them that they eventually give up and teach him Green magic, although they repeatedly warn him it's a terrible idea. They were right: it turns out that human beings are just too primitive to ever become competent in Green magic... oh, and once exposed to the indescribable beauty of the Green plane, no human will ever again be content with anything on Earth.
</li><li> Weirdly subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiyriaRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiyriaRevelations">The Riyria Revelations</a></em>. The elves are better than humans in every way (stronger, faster, tougher, more technologically advanced, and better at magic), but they have a single crippling weakness: their incredibly low birthrate. This allowed the humans to beat the elves in an ancient war by simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rushing</a> them until the elves arranged a peace treaty to end the (to them) unbearable losses. As one of the main characters put it, "the elves were drowning in a floodtide of humanity."
</li><li> Various magical species (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the Sidhe</a>) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> have this attitude towards themselves, but it's an unusual example of this trope because the various species are not seen as such by humans; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Harry</a> defies the hell out of the "don't mock them back" aspect of this trope (and says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">Screw You, Elves!</a> at every available opportunity) and the fact that no other humans do it is more because the elves are incredibly dangerous rather than because the humans agree with their declarations of superiority. Clearly an example where the author fully intended them to be annoying even when they aren't being openly antagonistic.
</li><li> By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimButcher">the same author</a>, Kitai of the Marat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em> often talks about the shortcomings of the human Alerans, but she avoids the usual problems of this trope because: she herself is a likeable and sympathetic character, her exclamations of "_____ is/are insane!" are usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> played for comic effect, her observations take the form of "your people are crazy" rather than "my people are awesome" and her criticisms are of social institutions that are either harmlessly ridiculous (the prudishness about nudity and sex) or clearly immoral (slavery), so she has a point. Any annoyance is also reduced by the fact that her people are clearly <em>not</em> intended by the author to be a perfect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">Superior Species</a>; in the first book they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">The Horde</a> of savage cannibals whom the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> easily manipulates into doing his dirty work with the intention of crushing them afterwards, and though they quickly show themselves to be a complex people their society clearly has a host of its own problems, even if they're different problems from the "civilised" Alerans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHouseOfNight">The House of Night</a></em> provides us with a serious in-universe example. Vampyre society is considered- both in-universe and by the authors- to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarysueTopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarysueTopia">completely perfect</a>. The narrative <em>explicitly states</em> that vampyres are smarter, hotter, stronger, and more creative than humanity. The only good humans in the story all assist vampyres in some way. Any humans who don't like vampyres are invariably hateful, murderous people who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoureJustJealous">hopelessly envious</a> of the vampyres' perfection and probably serving evil.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JonathanStrangeAndMrNorrell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JonathanStrangeAndMrNorrell">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</a></em>, the gentleman with the thistle-down hair is absolutely convinced that his beloved humans enjoy his games as much as he does. The idea that they are consistently horrified by their slavery on his account is so far removed from his own frame of reference that they just can't convey the notion to him.
</li><li> A mild example, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElminsterSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElminsterSeries">Elminster: The Making of a Mage</a></em>, Braer gently lectures Elminster (when he's become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">female version</a> of himself named Elmara) on how elves live in tune with nature, while humans destroy everything which they can't control.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenBrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenBrust">Steven Brust</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> novels are built on the question of "if elves are so amazing and perfect, how come they aren't dominating the world?" In Dragaera, they <em>are</em>. However, this comes not from any moral superiority: just the advantages of a greater size, a much longer lifespan and a culture that integrates 100,000 years of study in magic and strategy. It's even suggested they were <em>made</em> so by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursors</a>. As a result, they're often outrageous bastards who consider everything they do to be in the right. Humans residing in the elven lands suffer a stigma like that of immigrants, restricted to lower-class jobs and expected to stay out of the way.
</li><li> It is literally impossible to win an argument with the Lambertians of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PermutationCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PermutationCity">Permutation City</a></em>. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage">method of communication</a> is structured in such a way that any logical error is necessarily a syntactical error as well, meaning that if a group of Lambertians is told a fallacious argument, they will notice the error within a matter of minutes and then tell you what's <em>really</em> true. This backfires on the outsiders who seek their help to save their own universe, because the Lambertians live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsideAComputerSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsideAComputerSystem">Inside a Computer System</a>, but are not advanced enough to know that computers can exist. Therefore, they find the claim that they were created to be absurd because they have worked out a theory that explains how their universe could have come into existence naturally. Not only do they try to "correct" their creators and do nothing to help, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since their creators are also living in a simulation (it's complicated) this somehow makes the first simulation irrelevant, and the other universe collapses</span>.
</li><li> An interesting aversion occurs in Terry Brooks' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Shannara">Shannara</a></em> series. The elves there are the only sapient race not descended from humanity, and really are older and more naturally magical than humanity or the other races. Interestingly, though, they had, well before the beginning of the first series, forgotten their heritage and the vast bulk of their magical abilities. That is not to say that there were no arrogant elves, but the primary victims of their arrogance were other elves. The elves as a people had no particular sense of superiority, even during periods when they were among the best organized and most powerful factions.
</li><li> The Next in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenBaxter">Stephen Baxter</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLongEarth">The Long Earth</a></em> series come across as this. Aside from the usual traits associated with this trope (sexual liberation, preposterously advanced intelligence, perfectly logical, almost perfectly utopian society, outward condescension to regular humans), regular humans routinely talk up their superiority and are even implied to be on the path to completely replace humanity in the future.
</li><li> A self-righteous example would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> Mizzamir in the book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillainsByNecessity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillainsByNecessity">Villains by Necessity</a>.</em> The other elves have all left for a distant world, but he remained behind to guide mankind to a glorious future. No one dares argue with him, even as he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood">brainwashes dissident citizens into loyal ones</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard">Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard</a></em>. The elves of Alfheim <em>think</em> this is the case. Most of them have a very high opinion of themselves and believe that they're naturally superior to the other races of the nine worlds. The reality is that they aren't impressive at all. They're mortal, aren't graceful or in tune with nature, and they haven't been able to use magic for centuries. They aren't even attractive, as they're described as being weirdly thin with unsettlingly large eyes. Needless to say, nobody agrees with their perception of themselves nor do they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">make any effort to hide it</a>.
</li><li> The Adem from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle">The Kingkiller Chronicle</a></em> are this, effortlessly better than every other society martially, socially, musically, morally, and able to refute any objection the protagonist has to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySueTopia">Mary Sue Topia</a>.
</li><li> Adverted in Shannon Messenger's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeeperoftheLostCities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KeeperoftheLostCities">Keeperofthe Lost Cities</a></em> where Elvin society ends up not being as perfect as it seemed at first glance, with elves practicing a form of eugenism called Matchmaking and any elf that does not fit their ideal is shunned and condemned to live their whole life as a second-class citizen. Still, they are eternally young, beautiful, have no concept of racism by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofGod">Wordof God</a></em> and are seemingly unable of violence, to the point where they keep looking down on humans who are constantly at war with each other — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">though the Big Bad admires humans for this feature, as elves literally die from hurting others because their minds are too fragile to handle culpability</span>. They all possess superhuman abilities beyond human grasp such as telekinesis, thermal regulation, super strength and most of them possess an extra Superpower (called a Talent), such as Invisibility, Technopathy, or Telepathy, that they unlock in their teenage years. They are also heavily implied to be much smarter than humans, as one of the main characters openly mocks <em>Einstein</em> saying he's "not very smart" and tells the main character, who is in 12th grade at 12, she's average by Elvin standards as the dumbest elf ever would outmatch the smartest human with little to no effort. They are also much more advanced technologically than humans, as they have achieved teleportation and claim they could expand human lifetimes, treat cancer and infertility, but choose not to because they believe humans would abuse their technology or find a way to make it harmful. Thus, nuclear bombs were derived from humans corrupting Elvin technology - at a time elves decided to "monitor" humans and help them from the shadows - and things as mundane as chocolate cake and electricity were gifted by the elves. Plus, it doesn't help that every human that encounters them is in awe of their beauty and perfection and does not call them out for being condescending toward humans and being arrogant in general. They literally had a giant statue of a human with "rough features" kneeling in front of a perfectly beautiful elf built in a city they intended to be primarily inhabited by <em>humans</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And once it was discovered that the reason why humans tried to overthrow them millennia ago — which is also the reason why elves choose to abandon them and hide themselves in their sheltered world — was because a group of elves were kidnapping them and conducting experiments on them while the Elvin Council refused to address the problem, Elvin authorities and the main character, even though she was raised by humans, decide not to reveal the information in fear of causing a riot.</span>

Extra points for some humans thinking that Martians resemble elves (there is very little elfish in their behaviour, though).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> products address this issue from both sides, with a heavy dose of Lampshading. On the one hand, "elf-wannabes" abound among the humans of the Sixth World, slavishly watching human-bashing shows from Tir Tairngire and saving up for surgery to elf-ify themselves; on the other, actual immortal elves (leftover from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn">Earthdawn</a>)</em> are depicted as callous, spoiled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> powermongers, who hold non-immortal elves in nearly as much contempt as humans. Ironically, ordinary elves who just want to get on with their lives find both the "wannabes" and the nobles every bit as distasteful as other humans do.
</li><li> The elves of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> play the trope very straight indeed. The existence of the Elves' natural arrogance is thought to be a result of their exposure to the wild magics that have saturated the Warhammer world since the coming of the Old Ones. Elves are very resistant to magic, thanks to their natural affinity for it, but not completely immune. Rather than physical mutation and madness, such as humans might develop, this racial trait is the price Elves pay (just as the Dwarfs have been made universally stubborn and covetous for gold). But although they share the same basic psychological substrate, the three different kindreds of elves - High, Dark, and Wood Elves, express it in very different ways. Indeed, it might almost be said that the manner in which different elves manifest their race's natural sense of arrogant superiority is the defining feature of the different kindreds' cultures:
<ul><li> The Asur (High Elves) behave with a kind of patronising paternalism towards the lesser races  they think that poor, feeble humans and dwarfs are constantly in need of their help and should be saved from themselves by High Elf intervention. They see the preservation of the world and the good things in it as a noble responsibility that falls on their shoulders alone because nobody else is up to the task. The fact that they're not always wrong on this just serves to reinforce their beliefs and rub everyone else up the wrong way.
</li><li> The Druchii (Dark Elves) are obsessed with conquest and domination, and their take on elven superiority is that elves are so much better than everyone else that they can and should take what they want. Elves deserve to rule the world, and the lesser races exist for them to enslave or murder at whim.
</li><li> The Asrai (Wood Elves) are fierce isolationists. They have little to no interest in the affairs of the lesser races and see little point in having any dealings with them beyond telling them to get out of their forests at the point of an arrow. However, there is something of a schizophrenic duality at the heart of the Wood Elves, and if they do find themselves dealing with others then they might just as easily act like patronising but kind-hearted High Elves as callous, murdering Dark Elves.
<ul><li> Naturally each of the three cultures takes a very dim view of the others. The High Elves think the Dark Elves are amoral monsters, completely at odds with the noble duty of their race. The Dark Elves think of the High Elves as weaklings, who forfeit their birthright to rule by showing anything but disdain for races beneath them. Both think of the Wood Elves as rustic nobodies whose superior elven potential is being completely wasted. For their part, the Wood Elves think the High and Dark Elves are engaged in pointless and empty pursuits by dealing with the lesser races at all. Very, very few elves seem to exhibit a more enlightened, less arrogant approach to other races. The most prominent example is the High Elf High Loremaster, Teclis, whose attitudes appear to have been shaped by the fact that he is physically weak and prone to illness, and hence an uncomfortable reminder to other High Elves of a frailty they think their race above. In the novel Sword of Caledor, Teclis muses on the inherent attitudes of elves and thinks that the reason they always come out best in comparison with humans is that it's always the elves who set the criteria. Teclis became fond of humans after helping them win the Great War Against Chaos (it helped that he's the most powerful wizard in the world!), and founded the Colleges of Magic in the human city of Altdorf, teaching human students. He is a rare exception, and he knows it.
</li><li> At one point in the Storm of Chaos campaign, the Empire were getting owned by Chaos Daemons, until Teclis turns up and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">wipes out an entire daemon army with one spell</a></em>. The Grand Theogonist thanks him by calling him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Dirty Coward</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">for using magic</a>. At this point Teclis gets annoyed and decides to show why you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTauntCthulhu">Do Not Taunt Cthulhu</a> by pissing off and leaving the Empire to fight Chaos alone (he knew they would win without him but decided to let the humans do the fighting and dying to teach them some manners).
</li></ul></li><li> Oddly enough, the <em>dwarves</em> sometimes have shades of this despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVersusDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVersusDwarves">Elves vs. Dwarves</a> being a good summary of both races' relationships. The dwarves are annoyed by the elves but also look down on humans as weaker, less skilled, and making inferior beer (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageEqualsThought" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageEqualsThought">"badly made" and "human" sound the same in Khazalid</a>), not to mention humans being so vulnerable to Chaos corruption (dwarves use runes instead of the winds of magic, a much slower and rarer process but at least it doesn't backfire). They are honorable to fault, however, and will come to the Empire's aid as needed because of an oath dating back to Sigmar.
</li></ul></li><li> The Eldar of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> play this trope straight in every dealing with the "lesser races". It often fails to work because the other races are either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Xenophobes</a> and inevitably tell them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">Screw You, Elves!</a> with the biggest and nastiest guns at hand. Not that the Eldar are any better...
<ul><li> First you have the Craftworld Eldar, who take their arrogance to the levels of "we're better than everyone else, so we're allowed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">kill thousands of the lesser races to preserve the lives of a few of us</a>" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">(though to be fair, everyone else in the setting has the same mentality)</a>. Next, you have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Dark Eldar</a>, who take their arrogance level to "we're better than everyone else, so we're allowed to kidnap thousands of the lesser races and take them back to our inter-dimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> city and brutally torture, rape and kill them because we need to eat their emotions and souls, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">besides, it's fun</a>". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Yep</a>. Unlike their Fantasy counterparts, however, while the Craftworld and Dark Eldar don't <em>like</em> each other, they recognize each other as Eldar and are fully capable of cooperating for mutual benefit without stabbing each other in the back.
</li><li> One of the only, if not <em>the</em> only, Eldar who actually acknowledged that his race really isn't any better than the rest of the galaxy was a philosopher who had been given the title "the Perverse" because he considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil">Orks</a> to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Race</a>. His reasoning was that Orks are thriving, have all their great questions answered, and live simple lives of eating, sleeping, and fighting (and occasionally looting or cobbling something together). Everyone else, especially the Eldar, are struggling to stay alive as well as facing a number of existential threats.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has a sort-of example in the fairytale-inspired "Lorwyn" setting, where elves were, for the first time, just as heavily black-aligned as they were green. In-story, they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">so obsessed with beauty</a> that they <em>literally</em> worshiped it, and their caste-system was determined by who was the most beautiful. Bad enough on its own, right? Well, because they were so beautiful, they considered themselves the <em>de facto</em> rulers of the entire setting, and actively hunted down and killed "eyeblights," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">creatures they deemed "too ugly to live"</a>, which included goblins (<em>especially</em> goblins,) and even <em>disfigured elves</em> (There's a reason that the Lorwyn elves are called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">"elf nazis"</a>). Granted, when Lorwyn was plunged into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersGrimm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBrothersGrimm">Brothers Grimm-esque</a> darkness and became "Shadowmoor," a setting which was decidedly less interested in looking pretty, this made their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">change in position</a> all the more satisfying.
</li><li> The Sidhe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheDreaming">Changeling: The Dreaming</a></em> are immune to being made to look like fools with magic, and if you manage to do it the mundane way, they get a big stack of bonuses to cut you back down to size.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has an unfortunate history with this trope. The <em>AD&amp;D</em> 2nd Edition splatbook "The Complete Guide to Elves", also known as "The Complete Book of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace">Master Race</a>" in some DM circles, is <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwDWx1cAqP4">still<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> for Wizards of the Coast for how far it goes into making elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">very overpowered mechanically</a> with only very slight (mainly roleplay) drawbacks, along with fluff that paints them as highly smug, supremacist bastards.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>. Elves in this setting are less likely to lecture you and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">more likely to cleave you in half with a giant two-bladed scimitar</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer">Spelljammer</a></em> at least calls the elves out on it. You'd be hard-pressed to find any non-elf in the setting who doesn't find the Elven Imperial Fleet completely insufferable.
</li><li> An amusing subversion are the tritons, a deep-water type of merfolk. Theirs is a long history of fighting horrible things in the oceans miles below the surface, and so have the usual arrogance of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a>, but <em>because</em> these battles happen miles below the surface and there's little contact between them and land, no one knows or cares what the tritons are talking about, leading to a lot of bruised egos.

</li><li> The Europans are the closest species <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em> has to elves, being immortal, psychic, technologically superior, and potentially the oldest species in the solar system. They tend to go on about this a lot the few times they even deign to talk to the other species, although they do send out anthropologists to learn more about them. However, the real reason you can't say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">screw you Europans</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">tends to be...</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">unpleasant</a>.

<ul><li> The Viera in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> consider themselves to be above the Hume race since they don't cause wars or seek absolute power like Humes do. Only the main characters hear this and they never tried to show how Humes are not savages. Only a handful of Viera have a positive view of the Humes.
<ul><li> Elaborating on that, there was only one Viera in the game who seemed to outright like Humes and the world outside her village, but she was a bit... weird (her "liking" could be argued to be a fetish). There is a young Viera who was unsure what to think of the outside world, but at least she liked to be around Hume children. There are two traveling Viera who were very disappointed by what the world had to offer and only were impressed after watching the sea, of all things. One Viera looked down on humans initially, but after learning that a human sacrificed his life in an attempt to defeat dangerous dragon, changes her mind and begins sharing her knowledge with Humes. Fran, one of the main characters and a Viera who has led a pretty interesting life and is best friends (and possibly more) with a Hume, seemed quite regretful of leaving the village and cutting her connection with the supernatural woods, calling it a life of solitude.
</li></ul></li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> where elves are considered lesser and barbaric by the humans, who take up the arrogant mantle and enslave the elves; even after the elves are freed from slavery they're still third-class citizens.
<ul><li> The Dalish elves (who lead nomadic lives outside human settlements) attempt to invoke this over and over however, even when it's become glaringly obvious that it'll never work. All they have to show for it is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> on both sides of the issue and the destruction of any would-be permanent homeland they tried to establish so far (declaring those unilaterally then flipping off your much bigger human neighbours every time doesn't help). Even the City Elves think the Dalish are full of themselves if Fenris' attitude is any indication.
</li><li> Seems to be played straight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Solas</span> at the end of Inquisition, who seeks to restore the ancient elven empire (that could effortlessly use magic and was technologically superior to anyone else in Thedas during its heyday) and tear down the Veil, regardless of the harm to Thedas. He (like other surviving ancients) doesn't consider either of the existing Elf cultures to really be Elves either; he compares it to the difference between normal humans and the Tranquil (those magically stripped of emotion and personality). However, you are allowed to argue with him if you choose, indeed you can condemn his plan to tear down the Veil as monstrous, considering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it will kill basically everyone in Thedas.</span> If you have a good relationship with him he'll actually <em>agree</em>, and tell you that he would treasure being proven wrong when you inevitably come into contact.
</li><li> While not elves, the qunari are a straighter example of the trope. The general argument presented is that qunari are perfect because they are ordered and the only people we see oppose what they want are either massive strawmen or religious fanatics who see them only as heretics. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Hawke</a> only gets to call them butchers. It is ignored how they take children away from their parents, force others to accept only one role in life, and are blind to the fact that they might be wrong.
<ul><li> Inquisition finally gets a better perspective on the Qun via Iron Bull. Bull very much seems to think that the Qun is better in many ways, they are ordered, well trained, and seem pretty good at determining a profession a person is well suited for. However, it is emphasized that it works well because they eradicate anything that works outside of their idea of order. Re-education was mentioned. If you live the life the Qun sets out for you, it will be good. If you deviate from it or waver in your dedication, you will be brainwashed, exiled, or killed. There's also a fair amount of doublethink involved; for instance, they enforce strict gender roles by declaring that anyone not following them is mistaken about their gender identity.
</li><li> Inquisition's DLC Trespasser then completely subverts this trope by making the Qunari the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the entire DLC (as well as giving a <em>highly</em> negative portrayal of the Qun). It's worth noting that the negative implications had been there since Origins, but this is the first time that they are really in the player's face.
</li><li> While this was only in supplementary material rather than in the main games themselves, the Qunari had already been presented as one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> in the Dragon Age comic series, <em>Those Who Speak</em>, subverting this trope good and proper. Alistair, Varric and Isabela are captured by the Qunari and, after a few weeks in prison, Alistair and Varric are taken to the new Arishok, who is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">actually Sten, Alistair's old friend from his adventures in Origins</span>, someone who has a lot of respect for Alistair... and all this earns him is a backhand to the face and imprisonment for him and Varric in the nicer-looking cells, while Isabela is taken to be tortured and re-educated by a Tamassran (her crew have also been captured and kept in these pit-like cells). It takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alistair defeating Arishok in single combat</span> for them to actually lay off and entertain the idea of an alliance. While they do become allies, in the end, it still proves that Qunari philosophy isn't actually that compassionate to anyone who isn't Qunari, even if that person is "Basalit-an" (a respected outsider) or even their "kadan" (a close friend or loved one).
</li></ul></li><li> A major part of the setting is that <em>every</em> faction acts like this, and other than a few defectors from the underclasses absolutely nobody is buying it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Elf Queen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em> is so upset that her daughter Anne eloped with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">'horrible human boy'</a> that she curses his hometown, sending everyone there into eternal, unaging slumber. The only one who escaped that fate is the boy's father... who instead spends years pleading with the Queen to change her mind, to no avail.

This brought to a separation of the elves in two branches: light and dark. Light elves are comparably decent  but still quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a>  folks who are content to let the other people live their own lives. The Dark ones are convinced of the innate superiority of elvenkind and despise all the other races as lesser. The fact that both branches are mostly going deeper and deeper into wilderness, leaving place for industrialism of other races makes them an almost literal local version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican">Magical Native American</a>.

Both humans and elves have an archer unit and each type <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">levels up</a> through different promotional classes. The description for the highest-level elven archer is a three-paragraph long love letter about how they can shoot birds in the eye while blindfolded (or something similar); the description for the highest-level human archer just says that they're pretty good for a human, and then goes on for another paragraph about how much better elves are. Of course, as the game is open-source and fan-made, many of the campaigns are a little less elf-friendly... about half of them include a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">"sticking it to the elves"</a> mission, just for the sake of doing so.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em> contains many examples of this, with its many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">races of Mer (Elves)</a>. Each race of Mer certainly seems to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">believe it about themselves</a>, but as shown time and time again, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">just as flawed</a> as the races of Men they despise so much. To note specific examples:
<ul><li> The Altmer (High Elves) take the cake as the haughtiest culture in Tamriel. They are indeed responsible for much of Tamriel's art, science, philosophy, language, and religion, and (while there are exceptions) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">they have no issue letting the other races know</a> just how superior they believe they are. They are the direct descendants of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Aldmer (First Elves)</a> and consider the other races of Mer as a result of "degeneration" over the ages. (And don't even <em>bother</em> trying to bring up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">races of Men</a>...) Their religious beliefs state that they are the true descendants of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Aedra</a>, and the 4th Era ascension of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a> into positions of leadership within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a> has only exacerbated their beliefs of superiority. The other races react to this belief in a predictable fashion, and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">do argue with them</a>, ranging between general disagreement and contempt (the majority of people, including quite a few of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">fellow Altmer</a>) to outright open conflict (the Cyrodiilic Empire and the Stormcloaks of Skyrim). The Thalmor play up the ancient Aldmeri belief that Mundus (the mortal world) is a horrible, forsaken prison and that the creators of it did so out of malice. Thus, they act to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">destroy the world</a>, believing it will return their divine spirits to a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">pre-creation divinity</a>.
</li><li> The Dunmer (Dark Elves) split off from the Aldmer over religious differences thousands of years ago, and have spent much of the time since as an extremely xenophobic race who hated outlanders within their homeland of Morrowind but had no issue with raiding other provinces (particularly Black Marsh and Elsweyr) for slaves. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptChurch">corrupt Tribunal Temple</a> did nothing but reinforce the cultural superiority of the Dunmer while hypocrisy was rampant. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Following the events</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion Crisis</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Red</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano">Year</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonian</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">invasion</a>, they've at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty">learned a little humility</a>.
</li><li> The Bosmer (Wood Elves) actually tend to be very curious and are more an inversion of this trope, as they tend to cause more trouble than the human races do by sticking their noses into other people's business. Notably, it is believed that they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnevenHybrid">some human ancestry</a>, leading to them being a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">less alien</a> than some of the other races of Mer from a human perspective.
</li><li> The extinct <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwemer (Deep Elves or "Dwarves")</a> were an industrious, highly intelligent, and extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">technologically</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">advanced</a> people, but were also known to be cruel, arrogant, and dogmatic. Contemporary accounts describe them as "unfathomable" and "unknowable," with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">truly alien belief systems</a> unlike anyone else in Tamriel. It's said that even the <em>dullest</em> of their kind was still a genius compared to a clever man. They went so far as to try and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">make themselves Gods</a>, and managed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">vanish completely</a>, the whole race. Now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookOnMyWorksYeMightyAndDespair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LookOnMyWorksYeMightyAndDespair">all that is left are their machines and ruins</a>, picked clean by centuries of looters.
</li></ul></li><li> The Fae in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomsOfAmalurReckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a></em> more accurately play this role than the actual elves of the setting though for the most part this is subverted as you can argue with and even choose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">subvert the culture and/or lives of those fae or elves who put on airs</a>. The leaders of the Fae such as High King Titarion and Prince Cydan avert this by acknowledging that the Fae are in their twilight and show respect towards mortals.
<ul><li> The Gnomes take this even further than the Fae. Most Gnomes in the game preach on and on about Gnomes being the paragons of reason and logic in the world. Templar Octienne in particular is pretty arrogant <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which makes the end of the boss battle with him — using Fate to bash him through a window — extremely satisfying.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, the party comes across a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Village</a>.

The party essentially sits there and takes it, and never actually tries to rebuke him.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">At first</a>. Later, when they rant about how Half-Elves are unfit to live in their village due to their destructive "human" ways, Cless chews them out by pointing out Half-Elves only develop human values because elves ban them from their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Village</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">StarCraft</a></em>, given the nature of the Protoss as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Scary Dogmatic Aliens</a> with very advanced technology, Terrans try to not get in trouble with them.

Raynor's case is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a>, however, in that he was forced to help two Protoss forces in Char due to Kerrigan leaving them stranded there  by the time Aldaris arrives, Raynor was already used to Zeratul and Tassadar and saw Protoss more like equals.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProphesyOfPendor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProphesyOfPendor">Prophesy of Pendor</a></em>, the Noldor Elves are an extremely arrogant people to say the least, and most of them by the start of the game think the only way to deal with the human problem is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>. Befriending the Noldor is a challenging victory condition, as you start with -30 to reputation with them by default. Fluff text talks about how most human soldiers <em>dread</em> fighting the Noldor and would consider five-to-one <em>bad</em> odds, as they have magically enchanted bows and can shoot further and more accurately than any human archer. The Noldor really are every stereotype of elves being stuck-up, superior jerkwads.
</li><li> The Lunarians of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TouhouProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TouhouProject">Touhou Project</a></em> believe that "Impurity" is the source of mortality and death, and so they migrated to the Moon in ages past, untouched by death as it was, and formed a society there based around the concept of Purity... all of this would sound crazy if it wasn't for the fact that they were right, and they actually became immortal super-beings by separating themselves from death and mortality... Unfortunately, they are also outrageously elitist and xenophobic jerks towards all things associated with the Earth due to their conviction that all things coming from the Earth are inherently impure, which actually happens to be the case... Earthborn characters generally talk about the Lunarians as a bunch of obnoxious lunatics.
<ul><li> It's also shown (mostly in the official manga) that being right about their personal philosophy and having something to flaunt are two different things. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> when they come into conflict with earthborn Youkai again and their long period of fanatic isolationism lets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">Yukari</a> play them for fools.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the underlying messages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em> is the question of whether or not it's okay to kill video game characters simply because they're fictional. The monsters of the Underground are quirky individuals who are meant to subvert the trope of monsters being evil. They are nice, friendly individuals who can be talked out of trying to kill the protagonist. However, many of them express scorn towards the violence demonstrated by the humans of the past, and they frequently discuss the importance of finding peaceful solutions to conflict (Flowey, Toriel, Undyne, Sans, Asriel, etc). Never mind the fact that Frisk and the Player never get the opportunity to call out the monsters over the possibility of being killed over and over by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTheVictimCard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTheVictimCard">a bunch of so-called victims</a>, even with the inherent ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">save, load and reset</a>.
<ul><li> In one of his numerous Judgement speeches, Sans states that he can understand killing in self-defense, <em>but if you pay very close attention to his tone</em>, it's not hard to infer that Sans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellPlayer">doesn't really believe that Frisk/The Player actually killed people in simple self-defense</a>. Keep in mind that there is no dialogue option given to the Player to allow them to interrupt Sans's long-winded speech or call him out for his attitude:

This may also go some way towards explaining why they're on technological par with humans in spite of a 9,000-year head start. Maybe Fighter wasn't the one who needed the trial of sloth. <br/><br/>Another way they parodied this trope was by having being human be illegal in the elven lands and if you bother asking why or pointing out how unfair and stupid that law is, then you'd better have an argument about round ears being better than pointy ones or they won't take your claim/question seriously.
</li><li> Most elves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance">Sluggy Freelance</a></em> avoid this trope, being more on the cookie and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasElves">toy making</a> side of the elf spectrum. However, the "Years of Yarncraft" storyline does reference elves as "<a class="urllink" href="http://www.sluggy.com/daily.php?date=080728">mythological hotties who wouldn't give humanity the time of day<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ErrantStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ErrantStory">Errant Story</a></em>, the elves' belief in their own superiority has led to multiple instances of genocide. Considering the trolls to be flawed and mistaken creations of their gods, they made a pretty good effort at exterminating them but did not succeed. They nearly did the same thing to humans before deciding to instead "uplift" the humans by using them as servants. Then after a few humanelf hybrids went violently insane they decided to kill all half-elves. This backfired as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">the resulting racial and civil war nearly exterminated the elves</a> and they spent the next thousand years hiding from the rest of the world in an underground city.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstructed</a> by the fae (drow, dark elves, light elves, etc.) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales">Drowtales</a></em> who love to think of themselves as such, and while it is true that they possess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> powers that significantly put them above the humans, dwarves and orcs of the setting, they're also responsible for turning the surface into the Hell-hole it is thanks to their screwing around with demonic magic. Through the story, it becomes increasingly obvious that the fae rule through brute force and that they really aren't that much better than the "savage" humans and orcs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExistentialComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExistentialComics">Existential Comics</a></em>: You most certainly can when you are Foucault, Chomsky, and Fanon. Chomsky, in a parody of his usual style of criticizing America's foreign policy, notes how in a poll conducted (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerbalTic">by Sindar no less</a>) the greatest threat to Middle-Earth's peace in the eyes of Hobbits, Dwarves, Humans, Trolls, Orcs was the Elves.
</li><li> In place of Elves, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheInexplicableAdventuresOfBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheInexplicableAdventuresOfBob">The Inexplicable Adventures of Bob!</a></em> has the Nemesites, an alien empire that has legally owned the Earth since before humanity evolved, but considers us wildlife and generally ignores us. Having made a few friends on Earth, Princess Voluptua has become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntriguedByHumanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntriguedByHumanity">fond of us</a> and wants the Empire to do right by us, but even she tends to talk about humans in a patronizing manner, calling us "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourLittleDismissiveDiminutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourLittleDismissiveDiminutive">little critters</a>" and the like. Jean is always quick to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">tell her where to stick that kind of talk</a>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Web Original </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Hilariously subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU">Tales of MU</a></em>. The elves are immortal, wise, good at EVERYTHING and generally peaceful, but also arrogant as all get out and often absolutely batshit insane, especially when it comes to sexual matters (it is considered fairly rational elven behavior for a young elf to castrate the lover of a rival just to spite them, for example). They resent the weariness of their too-perfect lives and usually end up killing themselves. The major half-elf character in the story hates her heritage and everything to do with it.
<ul><li> It should be noted with Steff that she views herself as being an ugly talentless clod who looks about as much like a real woman (she's trans) as Sailor Bubba does, while Mack and her friends all see her as impossibly graceful and artistically talented and it takes Mack and several other characters a long time to actually figure out that Steff isn't biologically female. This is explicitly stated to be caused by Steff being raised by elves, by whose standards she IS a clumsy talentless drag queen.
</li><li> It should also be noted that most elves we see in the series are in the elven equivalent to their twenties, which are noted as being abnormally sociopathic in their dealings with everyone.
</li><li> The main character Mackenzie Blaise has this viewpoint about some of her friends (Dee and Amaranth), seeing them as being inherently purer because of their species (dark elf and nymph, in this case), although that probably has something to do with how Mack thinks of herself as being inherently corrupted because of her half-demon heritage (which has some support in the story). Whether or not the reader is supposed to feel that any one race is supposed to be inherently better than others is hard to tell—we certainly see faults with all of them as the story goes on.
</li><li> Merfolk in the MUniverse feel themselves to be inherently superior to all land species, although they don't really advertise this. However, as Mack discovers, it is rather hard to argue with them about this belief, as they on principle dismiss arguments from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prey. To them, any land creature in water is food and no longer has a right to be considered a sentient being.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The transapients of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/OrionsArm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/OrionsArm">Orion's Arm</a></em> aren't elves, per se, but they are better than you and quite aware of it. In fact, the only reason you'd ever argue with them would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">because they want you to</a>. This is actually an explicit rule of the setting: any transapient of a higher tier is superior to an intelligence of a lower tier, <em>end of discussion</em>. Not in a moral sense (there are plenty of examples of very amoral or even evil transapients), but intelligence-wise. The only way to get on their level is to become a transapient yourself.
</li><li> Played straight when several elves explain to the main characters of MDWS about how superior they are compared to humans. Then immediately subverted when the tank of the group punches the leader in the face while saying "But we're meaner".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Mahu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/Mahu">Mahu</a></em> in "Second Chance" several of the galaxy's races and empires think themselves superior to everybody else. The thadrakos, almost elf-like in their appearance, share this trait too except when dealing with humans, who they see as valuable allies and friends. The human Commonwealth on the other hand is not so comfortable with the thadrakos use of slaves, their expanding realm...or the fact that they are cannibals.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This, and the character types associated with it, are deconstructed with Aresia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>. Stories like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmazonsAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmazonsAttack">Amazons Attack!</a></em> notwithstanding, the Amazons are typically portrayed as a superior people, with superior morality, strength, and wisdom to those of "man's world." The bulk of Amazons act like this: dismissive of non-Amazons and appealing to man's world's obvious inferiority when anyone challenges them on it. Wonder Woman, on the other hand, tends more towards "yeah, they're inferior, but it's our duty to protect them from themselves." After a few arcs where both of these are called out, Aresia — a non-Amazon who's been raised under the Amazons' Can't Argue With Elves mentality, takes it to its logical conclusion and attempts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide">kill all men on the planet</a> and taking this stance with everyone who tried to stop her — even Wonder Woman herself.
</li><li> A human example occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug">Doug</a></em> in the form of Chalky Studebaker. He's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> of Bluffington Jr. High, and in one episode, it's discovered that he and Doug both got identical answers on a test. Everyone automatically assumes that Chalky is incapable of cheating, because he's so perfect and outstanding, so Doug naturally must have copied him — except Doug didn't. Doug spends the rest of the episode trying to track Chalky down to talk to him, and when he finally confronts him, Chalky admits that he did cheat — he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">so busy trying to be good at everything</a> that he didn't have time to study. It also shows us where this attitude came from —<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">his father</a>. Thankfully, Chalky owns up to his mistake and agrees to do a retest, even if it means missing an important football game, so it's ultimately a deconstruction of the trope.
