</div></div><p>Some work towards crushing their opponents. Others, though, prefer to just step back and watch them live on. This is "Cruel Mercy"  sparing one's enemy (or, in some examples, even actively keeping them alive) as a punishment rather than a reward.
</p><p>Heroes rarely kill their enemies: they either practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> or have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">moral friend</a> remind them "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">If You Kill Him, You Will Be Just Like Him</a>" if they ever get too tempted. However, some heroes are creative. Much like a torturer using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAndUnusualPunishment">Cool and Unusual Punishment</a>, the hero does <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Forgiveness">forgive</a> the villain, or at least spare his life, but does so only to inflict suffering and/or enact some poetic justice.

If they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeByProxy">doing it for revenge</a>, their aim will be to make the hero feel what they've gone through. Some are mental  rather than wishing to hear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoProudOfYou">So Proud of You</a>, it's their arch-enemy's disapproval they start to crave. Other villains are trying to make the character break down  they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">subject them to a series of</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rapes</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">make them watch</a> as they destroy what's precious to them, all in an attempt to push them beyond the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>. Maybe they want to see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">the heroes cry</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">bring them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">over to</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>. Some villains delight in showing the hero to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoStoic">Not So Stoic</a>, or they wonder what will happen if they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachHimAnger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeachHimAnger">Teach Him Anger</a>... or they just enjoy ignoring the hero's repeated pleas to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetItOverWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetItOverWith">Get It Over With</a>.
</p><p>There is no typical Cruel Mercy; each is tailored to the person for maximum effect. However, there are a few repeating variations. Sometimes, one is just allowed to live, especially if he believes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>, and now that he isn't the strongest, his self-esteem is non-existent. Similarly, some villains lose it because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHurtsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodHurtsEvil">Good Hurts Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCannotComprehendGood">Evil Cannot Comprehend Good</a>, so the hero's mercy is a kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Brown Note</a>. For others, the hero may force them into a mundane life where they go through a daily mental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a>. Still, more might refuse to take a life themselves but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowEmToTheWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowEmToTheWolves">won't deny others</a>  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWithHimAsYouWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoWithHimAsYouWill">especially those who have been wronged by the villain</a>  their own chance. In some situations, the hero may decide that being left to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishmentIsTheCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishmentIsTheCrime">live with the consequences of his actions</a> is the most fitting punishment for the villain. And sometimes, if the villain is too dangerous to let free, he is trapped in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TailorMadePrison">Tailor-Made Prison</a> along with the people he hates most in the world, or with a view of something he despises or which upsets him...

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goku planned to do this to Frieza during their fight on Namek, beating the tyrant senseless and driving him to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a> before deciding that, with Frieza's ego in shambles over having been defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">a Saiyan of all beings</a>, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling">Not Worth Killing</a>, outright telling him as such and ordering Frieza to "go crawl off someplace and hide" and continue to live with the shame of his defeat. Later, after Frieza <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnArmAndALeg">lost his arm</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTheManHeUsedToBe">entire lower body</a>, he tried it again before flying away. It backfires both times: the entire reason Frieza lost his limbs in the first place was because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">got hit with his own energy disc</a>, and when Goku gave him some energy to at least survive, Frieza turned around and tried to kill him with it; by this point, Goku is done giving Frieza chances and blows him away, outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouFool">calling him a fool</a> for not just walking away when he had the chance.
</li><li> Earlier, after Goku tricks Captain Ginyu into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">switching bodies with a frog</a>, Vegeta chooses not to kill him for this reason, finding Ginyu being forced to live life as a frog amusing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> adaptation, Gohan easily beats Ginyu-in-Tagoma's body despite being out of shape and only able to hold Super Saiyan form for a few moments. He spares Ginyu and tells him to get lost. This pisses off Frieza so badly, as it reminded him of the aforementioned mercy Goku gave him, that he goes and <em>tortures Gohan for it.</em>
</li><li> Frieza could actually be considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of this trope. Every time Goku showed mercy with the intent of making him live with the shame, Frieza would either attempt to kill him or blow up the planet, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the latter of which in <em>Resurrection F</em> and <em>Super</em> killed everyone on Earth and would have lead to a bad ending if Whis hadn't turned back time</span>. Frieza is the type of foe who <em>needs</em> to be killed.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens to Ritsuko in episode 23 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>. After revealing the secrets of the Terminal Dogma and of Rei and the Dummy Plug System to Shinji and Misato, Ritsuko <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">realises that Gendo used her, and destroys Rei's clones. She then breaks down into tears, inviting Misato to shoot her, saying that she welcomes death. Misato refuses, saying that Ritsuko is a fool for saying so</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> (both the manga and the <em>Brotherhood</em> series), Scar does a violent variation (not exactly mercy) to Dr. Marcoh and <em>really</em> makes it clear that post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, he's still an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>. Marcoh comes to Scar admitting that he had created the Philosopher's Stones which were used to wipe out most of the population of Ishval (Scar's country). While Scar has in the past killed state alchemists for less, he's cooled by this point and is also taken aback when Marcoh begs for death (Marcoh had been threatened by Lust and Envy that if he didn't make another Stone for them, they would kill Macoh's entire village). So, what does Scar do? He "helps" Marcoh to fake his death by using his powers to horribly disfigure his face.

</li><li> In the "Acts of Vengeance" storyline, Magneto captures Red Skull and buries him in an underground tomb. He says he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">should kill him, but he's not like him.</a> He instead leaves him there, with only air and ten gallons of water.

But Wolverine refuses to let him trigger his rage and ultimately refuses to fight him at all, realizing that leaving Mr. X forever wondering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWouldWin">Who Would Win</a> will cause him more torment than simply defeating him.
<ul><li> A particularly nasty example is Wolverine's treatment of Matsu'o Tsurayaba, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> boss who killed Wolverine's lover Mariko. Every year on the anniversary of her death, Wolverine fought his way past Tsurayaba's defences, took a piece of his body, and left him alive. This was taken to the point of Wolverine actively stopping Tsurayaba from killing himself or anyone else from killing him because Wolvie wanted him to suffer as long as he did. By the time we find out about this, Tsurayaba is missing a hand, an arm, a leg, half his face, and his body is covered with scars and medical implants.
</li><li> Wolverine isn't a stranger to this sort of treatment himself: during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>'s run, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Sabretooth had his "yearly tradition": every year, on the day that Wolverine believed to be his birthday, Sabretooth would track Wolverine down, regardless of where he was or what he was doing, beat him to within an inch of his life... and then walk away, just so that Wolverine knew that Sabretooth could kill him whenever he wished.
</li><li> In a story published in <em>X-Men Unlimited</em>(1st series) #40, 2003, Sabretooth did the same to a man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingTheMostDangerousGame">who was hunting him</a>. The hunter was treating Sabretooth like any other beast he hunted, and it was working. Sabretooth turned tables when he refrained his instincts and animalistic tendencies and started to act like a human, using his brain to outsmart the hunter. The hunter then thought he would be killed by Sabretooth...which didnt happen. Sabretooth, instead, took the hunters clothes, weapons, and technology, leaving him alone and naked in the woods, telling the guy that all he needed to do to survive was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">behave as an animal</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmericanVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AmericanVampire">American Vampire</a></em>, infamous outlaw-turned-vampire Skinner Sweet attends the book signing of a writer who was there back when Sweet was turned and has since made a fortune from his one novel, a fictionalized account of the outlaw's story. Sweet exits the event, leaving behind a note saying "You are old and I am young for eternity. So I let you live to suffer and die. Why not? What better revenge is there than that?"

This gets kicked up a notch when Hell is taken over by a pair of angels after Lucifer abandons his position. The two decide that horrible things will still happen, but for the purpose of reform instead of punishment. This makes everything so much worse because it implies a false hope that the torment of the damned might someday <em>end</em>. Keyword being "false."

Once Wil suffers a stroke that leaves him unable to move or talk, Atar drops the mask and gloatingly confesses everything, including his intention to keep Wil alive as long as possible, as revenge for his treatment and Wil having hanged Atar's father. When Wil dies, Atar breaks down entirely.

</div></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MeasureForMeasure">Measure for Measure</a></em>, the Duke does not kill Lucio as threatened but forces him to marry the whore who bore his child.

<ul><li> Depending on how you interpret it, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Angelo suffers this as well. The Duke doesn't have him killed but forces him to wed a wife he didn't want and live after having his crimes revealed publically. His original plan was to have him marry her and then be killed, but he ultimately changes his mind.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice">The Merchant of Venice</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Antonio</a> insists on Shylock, a Jew, converting to Christianity as punishment for what he's done. For a Jew, that's... let's just say bad. In Yiddish, the word for "Jew", "yid", is used as a synonym for "person". As a former Jew, he'd be neither accepted by the Jewish community nor the Christian one. And as what's a pitiful parting shot in comparison, Antonio takes some of his money and forces him to bequeath his estate to his runaway daughter and son-in-law in his will.
<ul><li> Even worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">in Shakespeare's time</a>, this would have been considered a <em>happy ending.</em> The Jew gets to be saved, right?

But the Prince of Verona tempers the sentence to exile because Tybalt killed Mercutio (the Prince's cousin) and Romeo avenged his friend's death.

However, this is not to help your opponent stand up better to you. The first one, while keeping the monster it battles alive, drains away its ATK points (and soul, in the manga), leaving only a 0 ATK point carcass instead, and even creates a token for its controller with the drained ATK as its Attack points. As for the second one, it is seen in Reptilliane decks, which focus on making the ATK of opponent monsters 0. Combined with this card, they can relentlessly keep attacking the weakened monsters, who, despite not being destroyed, are still inflicted with damage which their controller takes. Some Combos are even famous, such as using a card that prevents destruction by battle on an opponent monster and keeps attacking it with a monster with the ability to attack multiple times, such as the infamous Chimeratech Overdragon, Great Poseidon Beetle, and Number C107: Neo Galaxy-eyes Tachyon Dragon.

The Craftworld had resorted to taking souls from the Infinity Circuit to power Wraith Constructs, something Craftworld Eldar revile as necromancy.

Throughout the following season, Starlight still can't understand why she was forgiven, developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAllMySinsRemembered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeAllMySinsRemembered">a personality quirk</a>, and spends most of the season struggling with her shame <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishmentIsTheCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishmentIsTheCrime">and being haunted by her evil past</a>, to the point where she takes on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledFetalPosition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledFetalPosition">Troubled Fetal Position</a> when confronted by her old village.
</li></ul></li><li> This is how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Razer</a> joins the Interceptor crew in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GreenLanternTheAnimatedSeries">Green Lantern: The Animated Series</a></em>. He tries to goad Hal Jordan into killing him, since Razer had just caused the destruction of an inhabited planet, as well as the planet's resident Green Lantern, but Hal catches on to what Razer's trying to do, and refuses to let him off that easy, instead taking his Red Lantern ring and taking him prisoner. Razer, understandably, freaks out and begs for death.
</li><li> At the climax of the "The Battle For Mewni" special of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVSTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVSTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>, Toffee intends to do this on Queen Moon, burying her halfway in the dirt and walking away, with Moon's kingdom in shambles, her husband seemingly sent to oblivion, her daughter lost in the realm of corrupted magic, and all magic she could draw forth about to be drained from Mewni completely.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a>: The Animated Series ('90s)</em>, Storm meets and falls in love with a charismatic ruler. He asks her hand in marriage and she accepts, only to discover short afterwards that he's a cruel tyrant. She destroys his entire kingdom leaving it in ruins, freeing the people he had enslaved who start to rebel, and all while he's powerless to stop her. "STOOOORM!!!"
</li><li> In the season three finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em>, Enzo brutally defeats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Megabyte</a>. Hes given the chance to kill him for all the things hes done but refuses to. Instead, he leaves Megabyte alive so he can spend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">the rest of his miserable existence alone and crippled, forced to always remember the day he was humiliated in front of the whole world by the same child he once tormented</a>. And just for extra mental torture, he notes that the only reason hes indulging in this is that he thinks Megabyte <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling">isnt worth the trouble of killing</a></em>, crushing the villains fragile ego to bits. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Megabyte tries to take advantage of the cruel mercy to escape... but given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedOffToHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraggedOffToHell">what ends up happening to him as a result</a>, he probably wishes he hadnt.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> One of the many, many arguments thrown about between pro-death penalty/anti-death penalty groups is the theory that spending the remainder of one's life in prison is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">harsher sentence than being executed</a>. But the pro-death-penalty people note there are people like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">true psychopaths</a> (as noted a few times above) who will <em>never</em> see it that way; as long as they're <em>alive</em>, they'll never stop conspiring to win: be it by trying to break out, by trying to corrupt the prison, or by <em>any</em> other way they can devise. In which case, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsTheOnlyOption">Death Is the Only Option</a>.
<ul><li> This is practically the argument of philosopher Michel Foucault in his book <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish">Discipline and Punish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>: someone who went into prison and served their sentence, more often than not, will find it far harder to integrate back into normal society, essentially being marked wherever they go.
</li><li> Invoked some time ago in Italy by some lifer prisoners who requested the death penalty to be restored, because they found spending the rest of their lives in prison an excessive punishment.
</li><li> When Communism fell, the Russian Federation abolished capital punishment. Anyone convicted of murder after that point would be sentenced to life in prison, and anyone who was previously on death row had their sentence commuted to twenty-five years from that point, regardless of how long they had already been in prison. Many former death row inmates, who had spent years or decades awaiting execution, killed themselves, unable to face even more prison time.
</li><li> Suicidal death row inmates are put on suicide watch. Let that sink in for a minute<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0aq6g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0aq6g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0aq6g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The death penalty means that you will die at the hands of <em>the state</em>, which is enacting the penalty against you; essentially, you have your life <em>taken</em> from you for your crimes. Killing yourself, while achieving the same ultimate end, does not serve as a penalty because you are taking your life into your own hands <em>after</em> the state has stated you do not have that option anymore</span>.
</li><li> Even the most merciful form of punishment, rehabilitative justice, still addresses that criminals must have their personality completely changed in order to be reintegrated back into society (assuming this is possible, given the aforementioned psychopaths). Compounding this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">the everlasting guilt</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredOutlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetiredOutlaw">of reformed criminals</a>, as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButRejected" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReformedButRejected">the stigma that will follow them well beyond their sentence</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Turkish Sultan Alp Arslan did this to the captured Byzantine Emperor Romanos IV after crushing his army in the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert">Battle of Manzikert<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. His own court quickly deposed him, and later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">had him blinded</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Julius Caesar</a> specialized in this, often showing clemency to defeated rivals especially in Rome's civil wars, which, under the rules of Roman high society, left them permanently beholden to him because they owed him their lives. Cato the Younger actually killed himself to avoid this.
</li><li> This is one aspect of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_coup">Counting Coup<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> practice among the Great Plains Indians. It sends the message, "I can lay my hands on you and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop me. You are so far below me that you are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling">Not Worth Killing</a>."
</li><li> In pre-modern times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExile">exile</a> was this. Being kicked out of your country's borders with no way home, no support network, and a strong likelihood of being unable to speak the local language or know the way to a civilization, much less a friendly one.
<ul><li> Marooning, the naval practice of abandoning someone on a beach, is a variation of this. Ironically, the stereotypical desert island was a kinder punishment than a location with food and potable water: even assuming the latter scenario wasn't a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HungryJungle">Hungry Jungle</a>, the poor mapping and navigation of the era meant discovery was virtually impossible, and the marooned sailor would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">Go Mad from the Isolation</a>.
</li><li> Another variation is excommunication from a religious institution. Execution is kinder, as it still grants rites that allow the dead to go to their proper place in the afterlife. Excommunication means both being cut off from your social support network in this life and damnation in the next one<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note45atx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note45atx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note45atx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is why in the 11th to the 16th century, excommunication was the <em>preferred</em> method of dealing with a terrible enemy. Many a bribe passed into Papal hands to ensure that the proper judgment was rendered</span>.
</li><li> Similarly, being declared an outlaw. Make yourself annoying enough to those in power by not following the laws, and rather than seek you out and cast you into a dungeon, the King declares you literally "outside the law"; if you refuse to obey the laws, you also don't receive their protection, and anybody may rob, beat up, and even murder you without any penalty.
</li></ul></li><li> A popular internet meme is the phrase "May my haters live long to see my success."
<ul><li> Ninja from the band <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DieAntwoord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DieAntwoord">Die Antwoord</a> has a tattoo of a similar line, "May my enemies live a long time so they can see me progress."
</li><li> This is one half of the sentiment behind the old aphorism, "living well is the best revenge". (Along with the idea that stronger forms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge">revenge</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">aren't usually</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VengeanceFeelsEmpty">worth it</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> Many, <em>many</em> examples from warfare. One noteworthy tactic is wounding enemy soldiers instead of killing them because wounded soldiers take up more resources. For instance, small land mines (nicknamed "toe-poppers") used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">Vietnam</a> against American soldiers, would horribly wound but not kill, forcing the entire squad to withdraw and call for medivac, rather than mark the location of a corpse to be picked up later, and continue with the mission.
</li><li> After winning the Battle of Kleidion against Bulgaria, Byzantine Emperor Basil II, rather than kill all 15,000 of his prisoners, instead ordered that 99 out of every 100 prisoners be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">blinded,</a> with the 100th left with one functioning eye to guide the others home. The idea was that having to take care of people who could no longer contribute back to their communities would cripple the enemy far more than simply killing them would.
