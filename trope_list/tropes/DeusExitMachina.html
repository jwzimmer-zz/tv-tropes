</div></div><p>Taking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">most powerful character</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">writing them out of the story or arc</a>, to preserve the drama and make things tougher for the main cast.
</p><p>So you've got a villain running amok, and a designated plucky underdog hero who's been set up to save the day. Looks like time for some heroic derring-do, but wait  there's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">supporting character</a> who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">way, way,</a> <em>way</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">more powerful than the hero</a>, to the point where if he decided to take on the villain, the whole climactic struggle would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">be over in two seconds</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGlassCeiling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SidekickGlassCeiling">obviously we can't have that</a>, and if the character in question is any kind of good guy it would strain belief to have them just sit out the fight for no reason. Sure, you could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlotReaper">kill them off</a> or write them out of the story completely, but they don't have to leave <em>forever</em>, just long enough for the hero to have to face the menace du jour on his or her own. The solution: take the bruiser and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">put them on a bus</a> for a while. Maybe some other responsibility came up, maybe there's another villain rampaging around somewhere else, maybe they had the bad luck to break a leg and got stuck in the hospital, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectorBehindBars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectorBehindBars">maybe they were arrested</a> and are showing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfRestraint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfRestraint">Self-Restraint</a>. However it's done, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> is temporarily out of commission, and the weaker heroes have to win the fight on their own.
</p><p>If the villain is smart enough, they will find a way to invoke this by luring the character out of the way before setting the plan in motion, but the character can come off as rather feeble-minded if they were easily called away by some paper-thin ruse, leaving in jeopardy whatever the villain was after. Alternatively, this may come into play when the main hero is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">much more powerful than the supporting cast</a>; in order to give them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a>, the all-powerful hero needs to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Depower">depowered</a>, incapacitated, or distracted.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>An alternative approach is to have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">immensely</a> powerful character actually join the plucky underdog's team for the big epic battle. He could easily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anticlimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anticlimax">save the day with a snap of his fingers</a>...and then that character is immediately knocked out or otherwise disabled so that the story can actually be interesting. (This can also have the side effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">making the villain that much more threatening</a>.)
</p><p>On rare occasions, it may be a villain far higher up the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SortingAlgorithmOfEvil">Sorting Algorithm of Evil</a> who drops by for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBossPreview">Final Boss Preview</a> to foreshadow the difficulty of future encounters before giving the weaker villain back his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">Worf Effect</a>.

<ul><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> movie does this as well, since Unit 01 had essentially become a god at the end of the second film. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Eva is used to provide perpetual power for Misato's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">Cool Airship</a>, the Wunder, and Shinji ends up piloting Eva Unit 13 instead</span>.

</li><li> During the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, Shino, who has the best tracking abilities out of all the Konoha 12, is out on a mission with his father, preventing anyone from being able to find Sasuke after his narrow victory over Naruto.
</li><li> It's also done in the main series as well. Team Guy was conveniently out of town when Pain invaded Konoha. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Given that Might Guy is able to put Ten-tails jinchuuriki Madara Uchiha against the ropes very late in the story, he would've easily taken down the less powerful Pain.</span>

Either one of those two aiding Naruto during the fight would have drastically altered the fight's progression. Also, several of the more powerful Jonin were away on missions.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Goku, despite being the hero, often plays this role in later story arcs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> and all through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. Since he'll almost inevitably win the battle once he joins in and end the saga early, circumstances always conspire to keep Goku on the sidelines just long enough for all the other heroes to get beaten up first. When Vegeta and Nappa arrive on Earth, he's still in the afterlife and is only revived once all the others have been thoroughly defeated. When everyone goes to Namek, his spaceship's the last to arrive, and soon after landing, he's critically injured and spends several more episodes floating in a regenerative tank. When Doctor Gero begins his rampage, Goku's too busy fighting off a heart illness to help. And so on It really says something when the person who is able to teleport still somehow manages to arrive late. In the timeline Future Trunks came from, Goku got permanently written out by contracting a heart virus that killed him. The Dragon Balls cannot reverse a natural death or one caused by disease. His absence led to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>.
</li><li> The Garlic Jr Saga, the only filler saga in the entire series, takes place while Goku is away from Earth. Vegeta also leaves to look for Goku, leaving Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, Mr. Popo, and Kami to deal with Garlic's return. If Goku was around, he would have dealt with Garlic without any issue or been corrupted by the Black Water Mist and be close to unstoppable since <em>no</em> character at that point in the series could stand against a Super Saiyan. Vegeta would have the same issue to a lesser extent since his power is second only to Goku's. In fact, <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> distinguishes itself for having multiple tiers of the trope - a really long fight will probably start with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">Yamcha or Krillin</a>, then bring Tenshinhan/Piccolo/Trunks/Vegeta, and finally let Goku or Gohan show up to finish things...and at least one fight (versus Cell) takes this even further, for a grand total of eight fighters in sequence facing off against him in a row, without any other villains participating. Naturally there were very good, impressively coincidental reasons they couldn't all have attacked at once.
</li><li> <em>Vegeta</em> gets the "honor" of doing this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrolySecondComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrolySecondComing">Broly  Second Coming</a></em>. There's zero reason as to why he didn't rush in the instant he detected Broly's ki (and he <em>should</em> have detected it), and at this point in the timeline, Vegeta had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Saiyan 2</a>, which could have trounced the pile of muscles easily (or at least be actually helpful, as long he didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">forget about his powers</a> like Gohan who didn't go beyond regular Super Saiyan).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZResurrectionF">Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F</a></em> both Goku and Vegeta were training off-world during Frieza's invasion. By the time they found out what was going on, the other Earth's fighters and Jaco finished stomping Frieza's army into the ground and were facing against the big guy himself. If they were there from the start, Goku by himself would have torn apart Frieza's army, leaving nothing for anyone else to do. In the dub, Krillin lampshades this by saying he wished for once Goku was there at the start of the battle. Buu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrittenInAbsence">Written-In Absence</a> is also a similar case. While he would have been no match for Frieza's golden form, he could have just turned the entire army into candy or conventionally killed them all just as easily. Depending on how arrogant Frieza is, Buu's candy ray could have conceivably hit him, too, ending the entire threat <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0t5nx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0t5nx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0t5nx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Frieza remarks that his father specifically warned him to <em>never</em> fight Majin Buu </span>. Later arcs reveal that he could've probably defeated Frieza's non-Golden forms as well with just his fists<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13zoq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13zoq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13zoq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the anime version, we see Mr. Buu being clearly stronger than Basil-even after the latter powers himself up using special food- who later proves himself to be capable of giving base Goku's level a challenge when he and his brothers team up; in the anime base Goku was somewhat stronger than fourth-form Freeza at the time of the Resurrection <em>F</em> arc and much stronger by the time he fought Basil. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalWimp">In the manga version</a>, Frieza's non-Golden forms (and Goku's non-god forms) just outright are not anything special compared to the previous power scale. He's about even with Super Saiyan Caulifila who is equal to Super Saiyan 1 Goku, who in turn, while much stronger than he was in the Buu arc, is not overwhelmingly different from that point.</span> which again could have ended the entire threat right there before Frieza got a chance to go through his lengthy transformation. This is lampshaded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>'s original script, where Krillin notes Goku and Vegeta's absence while confronting Frieza but says they'll all be fine as long as Buu's there... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">only for him to suddenly notice that Buu is absent too</a>.
</li><li> This trope is the entire reason why Vegito de-fused once he entered Buu's guts. He outclassed him so much that the fight wouldn't have had <em>any</em> tension whatsoever if Vegito finished it. Also, Super and GT would've never happened. This is also the same reason why Gohan, Goten, and Trunks were killed by Buu when he destroyed the Earth while they were still unconscious. This is lampshaded as Goku suggests bringing them to help to destroy Buu after they are revived, but Vegeta refuses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">because he wants the people of Earth to protect themselves for once.</a>
</li><li> The end of the Cell games saga removes both Goku and Future Trunks before the final battle with Super Perfect Cell (Goku sacrifices himself to stop Cell from destroying the Earth, and Trunks is killed by a sucker punch when Cell is revealed to have survived). They are two of the four characters strong enough to harm Cell at this point, the other two being Gohan and Vegeta. Since, unlike Vegeta, neither of them would have hesitated to double-team Cell with Gohan if the situation became desperate enough, they had to go.
</li><li> In the Future Trunks Saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Zamasu and Goku Black are only able to carry out their plans due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the death of the Gods of Destruction via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchillesHeel">their life-link to the Supreme Kais</a>, as Zamasu and Goku Black proceeded to kill the enormously weaker Supreme Kais in order to get rid of the Gods of Destruction (who would have likely been the only beings capable of one-shot killing them, as seen when Beerus kills Present Zamasu)</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Beerus and Whis heavily surpass Goku and Vegeta in terms of power and they could end any threat in an instant. However, despite being the God of Destruction and it being his job to help keep balance in his universe, Beerus is a lazy ass who only uses his power to punish those who just piss him off and seeing as Whis is his trainer, he just stays out of everything. Thus, the two constantly stay out of fights and leave it to Goku and Vegeta.
</li><li> By the end of Dragon Ball Z, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Majin Buu</a> has joined the heroes... but in both tournament arcs in <em>Super</em> (Universe 6 and Universe Survival) he is rendered unable to participate, because he'd be a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> for Universe 7 if he did.

<ul><li> In the Skypiea arc, Luffy spent most of his time inside of a giant snake. He broke out just when every other bad guy was defeated except for Eneru, the villain of the arc. It wasn't that he was overwhelmingly powerful at the time compared to his crewmates, just that due to his rubber body he was completely immune to most of what Eneru could do and was capable of taking him out pretty easily compared to other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">big bads</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">Super-Effective</a> indeed.

</li><li> Red Haired Shanks, during <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Whitebeard's war on the World Government</span> was busy battling another of the Four Emperors.
</li><li> When Luffy's brother Ace was first introduced, he proved be an extremely powerful combatant, easily destroying a fleet of ships with a single attack and fighting a previous logia antagonist to a standstill. Said logia curbstomped Luffy during their first meeting, making him one of the strongest characters in the entire saga. While it's clear that he's much stronger than Luffy, especially with his logia abilities, he doesn't bother getting involved in the whole Arabasta affair due to his focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Blackbeard</a>.
</li><li> This happens to the <em>entire crew</em> so that Luffy can go and try to save his older brother from his execution.

<ul><li> An anime filler arc has the main villain freeing the spirits of the Zanpakuto to fight against the Shinigami. When Yamamoto's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Ryuujin Jakka</a> refused to rebel, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> seals Yamamoto in some sort of barrier, leaving him MIA thus far.Turns out, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yamamoto sealed himself in there in order to keep Muramasa from accessing his memories. Making this a subversion of sorts</span>.
</li><li> Small fry. Every single major event in the series relies upon single combat, usually involving Ichigo, however much/little sense this makes. The lengths the story goes to in order to justify things such as the three strongest Captains (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Yamamoto</a>, naturally) all being out of play when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> first appears, or a group of only five people (out of the twenty or so at the right power level) going into Hueco Mundo are generally amusing, but eventually, the show stops even giving explanations (why, exactly, did Urahara's group wait so long to join the False Karrakura Town battle?) and calls it a day.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures">Pokémon Adventures</a></em>, main character Red is frozen in a block of ice so that Yellow can take over in the second story arc.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime, meanwhile, Ash routinely gets rid of his old high level Pokemon to make room for the new models. This is actually played with in the early Johto episodes. Ash has Charizard with him for a while and uses him to absolutely obliterate every single trainer he comes across in one episode, most of which are just starting out. Brock and Misty call him out on this, and at the end of the episode Ash leaves Charizard at the Charicific Valley to train. Ash also has a tendency in full battles to lose or not be carrying a mon that would have an advantage over his enemy's ace. This practice actually began with Lapras getting double KOed in his battle with Drake, whose Dragonite has a weakness to ice.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityMinusOneSword">Goodra</a> had a rather short time on Ash's team for this reason; though before it parted from Ash at its wetland home, it got to have a sizable role in the Gym battle versus Clemont. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And come the end of the XYZ series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Ash-Greninja</a> gets hit with it too, having to stay in the Kalos region to help Squishy and Z2 wipe out the remnants of the disaster caused by Team Flare.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Done occasionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>. During the Mahora arc, Negi had to go off and find the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, leaving everyone else to take care of her army of robots. Later on, during the Gateport incident, Fate incapacitates Negi <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by impaling him with a chunk of rock</span>, forcing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a> to fend for themselves until Negi recovers. Another possible example would be Konoka, who's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraordinarilyEmpoweredGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtraordinarilyEmpoweredGirl">unstoppable</a> force of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMagic">healing</a> with an inextinguishable pool of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Mana</a>, but rarely arrives to the battle till she's not needed, leaving her to handle clean-up instead.
<ul><li> Another example of this combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooPowerfulToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooPowerfulToLive">Too Powerful to Live</a>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jack Rakan, who was essentially invincible, is ultimately defeated due to Fate's newly revealed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> abilities. Granted, there's a good plot reason for Fate to have that power, but it seems to have been revealed solely to have an excuse to take out Rakan</span>.
</li><li> A third example is Evangeline. A vampire and one of the strongest mages in the manga, she easily wipes the floor with Fate when the two encounter one another. However, due to the fact that she's stuck within Mahora Academy grounds, she can't help Negi and his friends when they need her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> When she finally gets a chance to join the final battle, it's over very, <em>very</em> quickly.</span>

</li><li> Its done earlier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a>.</em> Patamon is always the last to digivolve to new levels, so that the other Chosen have the chance to fight.

</li></ul></li><li> Fox Spirit Chizuru is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a> prior to a major battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kanokon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Kanokon">Kanokon</a></em>, giving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrdinaryHighSchoolStudent">Ordinary High-School Student</a> Kouta the chance to defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> by himself. It's a bit of an unusual example, because normally they work together anyway to defeat their enemies, but Chizuru usually prompts their fusion and she's in control during it, and Kouta still needed her around so <em>he</em> could possess <em>her</em> (usually it's the other way around) during the fight, but he still does the work himself.
</li><li> The author of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> specifically stated that Sejuro Hiko, Kenshin's master was so powerful that he was an unfair advantage for the heroes. His sidelining is mostly due to the character's own disinterest in the heroes' struggles, so he only comes in to help rarely, rather than being plot-deviced out. He's just not that heroic.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Miroku</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em> has a powerful attack called the Wind Tunnel, which can suck anything into a void. This is <em>anything</em>, so in his debut appearance when he is opposing the eponymous character, he issues a warning to villagers to put some distance from him, leading to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a>. In addition, if he sucks in anything poisonous, he gets poisoned, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Naraku</a> has plenty of poisonous wasps to give as support. Also, overuse and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">even having the ability at all for too long</a> will eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">lead to his death</a>. You can almost sense that the author regrets giving Miroku such a powerful ability in the first place. After a certain point in the series, EVERY battle includes a token scene where Miroku tries to use Wind Tunnel only to have Naraku's poison bees show up out of nowhere, preventing him from using it. This has the ironic side-effect of making him the most powerful character on paper, but the most useless in practice.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MuhyoAndRoji">Muhyo and Roji</a></em>, Page sets up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> for Roji and other magic law practitioners by locking them in a house and sending real haunts after them. Unfortunately, one particularly dangerous haunt, Bellocent of Mist Mountain, sneaks into the test and cuts the power, preventing Page and the other powerful magical law practitioners outside from opening the gates when they realize that the test has become far more dangerous than it should be, and they only get in after Roji has already won.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RaveMaster">Rave Master</a>'s</em> Elie could have easily used her magic to wipe Demon Card off the map, blow Lucia into the next century (maybe even literally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">given how she blew herself half a century forward</span>) and cream Doryu and Ogre, which would have kept Hardner from ever attempting his fusion gambit. Naturally, she had to go and get amnesia so she wouldn't know how to do all this.
</li><li> Makarov of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em> has his magic drained at the beginning of the Fairy Tail vs. Phantom conflict when distracted by hearing that they kidnapped Lucy, putting them at a severe disadvantage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, once he gets back it he just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">takes down what's left of the enemy all at once</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Happens <em>again</em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Laxus and his bodyguards try to take over the guild</span>, and Makarov, Natsu, and Gajeel are prevented from doing anything because a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContainmentField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContainmentField">a barrier</a> is keeping them sealed in one area of the plaza.
</li><li> This happens to Erza in both the Laxus story arc (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakenForGranite">turned into stone</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until her magic eye makes the spell run out early</span>) and the Oracion Seis arc (poisoned by Cobra and left disabled until the other members could <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">rescue Wendy who could cure the poison</span>).
</li><li> This actually happens in nearly every major arc, with Erza being the primary target (which makes sense, because given Laxus' lazy/disinterested nature until being exiled and Mystogan and Gildarts' near constant absences she is essentially the strongest member of the guild who's available to help). Lets see here...
<ul><li> Phantom Lord Arc: Makarov as stated above, and Erza is KO'd after tanking a shot from the PL <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">massive cannon</a> so nobody else got hurt. Laxus refuses to help, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And Gildarts is still off on his 100-year Mission while Mystogan is busy getting Makarov his magic back</span>.
</li><li> Tower of Heaven Arc: Erza is stuck inside a card (meant to protect her, ironically) until the battle with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon Swordmistress</a> and the Big Bad himself.
</li><li> Fighting Festival, see above. Plus, during the Final Battle, Mystogan leads off and appears to have the upper hand, but gets his mask blown away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> revealing his identity as the Edolas Jellal, which means their faces are identical</span> and he leaves to avoid causing a rupture with Erza and Natsu, THEN Erza leaves the building to lead the counterattack against the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Thunder Palace before it wrecked the town</span>, leaving Natsu and Gajeel to handle the arc's Big Bad.
</li><li> Oracion Seis Arc: See above. Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A resurrected Jellal is taken out of the action early against Midnight and later can only support Natsu by giving him the Flame of Rebuke, as the Midnight battle left him too drained to fight</span>.
</li><li> Edolas Arc: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Practically the entire set of heavy hitters in the Guild is taken out of the way by being frozen as a lacrima crystal</span>. However, this is a noticeable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">aversion</a> for the series, because Erza is NOT among them this time, although much of her time is spent locked in combat with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her Edolas counterpart</span>.
</li><li> Grimoire Heart Arc: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Makarov is taken out early by Hades, and Gildarts, Fried and Bickslow all left the island before the attack begins. They do return later, however</span>.
</li><li> Juvia is also a frequent victim since unlike most of the guild she's actually friends with most of Natsu's team, and doesn't have her own team to hang with. Despite this she's rarely tagging along with Natsu's group, and when she is she's usually disabled by either stone/taking herself out to free another/frozen in Lacrima. This is because (much like the Logia users in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>) she can ignore most attacks by turning her body into water and reforming so most enemies can't hurt her. The two times she did assist them in battle she was brainwashed for most of the first fight until Lucy freed her so they could double team the villain, and the other was against an opponent who could negate her water shifting by causing her pain and damage regardless.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of Laxus, in what sadly appears to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsAffliction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsAffliction">Redemption Equals Affliction</a> scenario due to him having performed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">Heel-Face Turn</a>, at the beginning of the Tartarus arc <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he and the entire Thunder God Tribe are out of commission after the demon Tempesta pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> by releasing a deadly poison into the air with the intention of killing off the entire town of Hargeon, and Laxus himself makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> by inhaling as much of the poison as possible in a desperate bid to save the town's citizens. He survives, but just barely, and the poison still manages to kill over a hundred Hargeon inhabitants</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens all the time in all the story arcs of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> with Ikki. The Phoenix has the "Strength of an army" but is always elsewhere. Mildly applied to Shiryu as well, but...well, he's not as strong.
</li><li> Happens in the second episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. It seems the author realized that having Yugi beat Kaiba at the end of the first card game arc (pilot episode in the anime) by using Exodia, the only invincible, instant win monster in the entire game, was a problem now that the entire series became about this card game. After all, every conflict would become a preordained conclusion; if Yugi's about to lose he will draw Exodia and get the instant win. So immediately after that (the second damn episode in the anime) they get thrown off a boat by a minor character and never brought up again.
<ul><li> They actually do in the alternate form of Exodia Necross and the Rare Hunter who builds an illegal deck around drawing Exodia, and said minor character (Insector Haga/Weevil) is Yugi's first Duelist Kingdom opponent.
</li><li> This also applies in the series whenever Yugi is deprived of having Yami Yugi's persona available to work with him and must go against an opponent all on his own, such as playing Dungeon-Dice Monsters against Duke Devlin/Ryuji Otogi (or a duel against a possessed Bandit Keith in the anime) and his duel with Yami Bakura in the Memory World story. With Yami Yugi's skill, he'd likely be able to figure out a trick to defeat his opponents without too much hassle, while having regular Yugi doing it by himself not only makes it easier to increase the drama but also allows him to grow on his own without having Yami Yugi to fall back on.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em>, there's Yuri Tsukikage, alias Cure Moonlight, who's taken out in the very first episode and left powerless for 3/4ths of the series. Once she regains her powers, you can clearly see why she was taken out.
<ul><li> There's also the mysterious man who saves Tsubomi from time to time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">whose actually her grandmother's fairy partner, Coupe</span>. He just shows up to rescue the girls and bails out quickly.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FreshPrettyCure">Fresh Pretty Cure!</a></em>, you got Chiffon, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a> Mascot with powerful, undefined powers. While a lot of the anime is focused on the child and its destiny, both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> and the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettyCureAllStars">Pretty Cure All Stars</a></em> movie takes Chiffon out extremely early.
</li><li> A minor example in the "Little Army" prequel manga for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em>. When Miho is hiding in a tank while burdened with doubts over whether to continue with tankery, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">just as Emi is set to leave for Germany</span>, Sakuyo, one of the family maids, makes note of her habit of doing this whenever she's troubled, but then thinks to herself that it was always her sister Maho who convinced her to come out. The task of persuading Miho to come out falls to Sakuyo and Miho's friends, Chihiro and Emi.
</li><li> This is the main reason why in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/QueensBlade">Queen's Blade</a> Rebellion</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leina, the main heroine, is sidelined for almost the entire story: By the time <em>Rebellion</em> came out, Leina becomes the most powerful living being (only behind the angels and demons) ever existed, being able to wipe out armies by <em>herself</em>. The only way to make Leina not taking part of the plot of <em>Rebellion</em> is by making The Swamp Witch cursing her by making her sleep for many hours and hindering her skills, so Leina could not being able to steal the spotlight from Annelotte and the rest of the new cast</span>.
</li><li> Retsu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetKiraDeco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JewelpetKiraDeco">Jewelpet Kira Deco!</a></em> can make quick work of virtually any enemy, plus, he's the only member of his team immune to Coal's depression-inducing clouds. To avoid having an episode's plot resolved too early, he's always gone away to train in some remote location, only showing up near the end of an episode.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mirio Togata/Lemillion</span>, a character who could potentially stand in the way of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deku becoming the #1 Hero (which we already know is going to happen), gets shot with a specially-made bullet that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower">permanently removes his Quirk</a></span> at the end of the same arc that introduces them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A subsequent arc implies that the person whose Quirk was used to craft the bullet may be able to restore Mirio's Quirk in the future, but this has yet to happen. In the meantime, this allows Deku to be the one to take down a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a>, a big step on the way to making a name for himself as a hero and incredibly valuable combat experience for him to catch up to Mirio's skill level.</span>
</li><li> During the Assassination Island arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the students force Koro-sensei into his ultimate defense mode, in which he is rendered immobile for 24 hours. When Takaoka and his hitmen attack the class, the remaining 15 students and the other two teachers have to handle the situation by themselves</span>.
</li><li> This is the basic plot of nearly <em>every</em> arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em>, whether in its webcomic, manga, or anime form. The underlying premise of the series is that Saitama is so ludicrously powerful he can defeat any opponent with a single punch-which also makes him incredibly bored and apathetic, since nothing is a challenge. Thus, almost every arc involves all of the supporting cast struggling to hold off the latest threat to the existence of humanity until Saitama can be bothered or convinced to intervene, at which point the villian is rapidly defeated (and usually killed outright).
<ul><li> The officially licensed game turns this trope into a game mechanic; Saitama is, of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurposelyOverpowered">Purposely Overpowered</a> being able to KO all opponents with any attack and is completely immune to damage and hitstop (except in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorMatch">Mirror Match</a> of course). The catch though, you're forced to use nerfed versions of other members of the cast before Saitama becomes available to use, so it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock">Race Against the Clock</a> to stall out your opponent until Saitama shows up, at which point the player is "rewarded" with a complete curb stomp in his favor.

</li><li> In the 1960s, when Adventure Comics featured the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LegionOfSuper-Heroes">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>, the Legion had several one-off encounters with some guest character (often a stranger applying for Legion membership) who harbored a secret, and who often turned out to be (in disguise) someone whom the Legion already knew. In each of these stories, Saturn Girl was conveniently called away on some separate emergency and wasn't able to participate in the main adventure. Saturn Girl is a telepath: if she had been available to read the stranger's mind, the story would've ended on the first page.
<ul><li> Saturn Girl once asked the Legion to admit the masked Sensor Girl solely on her recommendation. Sensor Girl had shared her identity<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Princess Projectra</span> with Saturn Girl, who agreed to keep her secret.
</li><li> Likewise with its roster of multiple Superman-style Kryptonian powerhouses, especially during the Silver Age. There were very few problems that couldn't believably be solved by Superboy and Mon-El punching it in the face, and they were usually written off on some mission of vague but vital importance to keep things manageable.
</li></ul></li><li> This is practically the <em>raison d'etre</em> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> superhero <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSentry">The Sentry</a>. He's a throwback to heroes (well, okay, mostly just Superman) from the Silver Age, with all that entails; he has "the power of a million exploding suns" and is recognized as pretty much hands-down the strongest super in the world. And he could handle pretty much any threat that emerged with one hand tied behind his back... if it weren't for the agoraphobia and super-evil split personality that incapacitates him whenever he'd be most useful.
</li><li> During the early issues of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDefenders">The Defenders</a></em> (Marvel Comics, we're going off the original series here), the writers had trouble coming up with halfway decent reasons why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> couldn't just wave his hand and eliminate the problem in one page. Strange also took himself out of the story for forty days during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em>, claiming it wasn't a matter for the office of Sorcerer Supreme. He later regretted his inaction.
</li><li> Another hero absent from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>. The writers knew well that whichever team had a powerhouse like him in their ranks would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">pretty much decide the war</a>, and thus they choose to get rid of him for the time being. After taking some advice from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MariaHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MariaHill">Maria Hill</a>, the Illuminati decided that The Hulk was too dangerous to be controlled and that he needed to be dealt with accordingly. They put him as an unconscious Bruce inside a spaceship that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">was meant to send him to a peaceful planet where he would be happy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">but instead sent him to Sakaar</a>, a violent planet ruled by a tyrant with an iron fist and a penchant for gladiatorial games. The fans were quick to note that once The Hulk would return, the Illuminati <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">would be very sorry for what they did</a>. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WorldWarHulk">they WERE...</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">for a while, at least</a>.
</li><li> Amusingly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> itself counts as this for virtually every Marvel superhero, when we learn that whilst the many heroes of Earth were bickering over legislation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Annihilation">the rest of the Galaxy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WarOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/WarOfKings">was falling into</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheThanosImperative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheThanosImperative">several apocalyptic wars</a>. The cosmic heroes get pretty annoyed at the real reason the normally-reliable Earth heroes didn't help out.
</li><li> Just about all <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em> comic book universes have done this with Optimus Prime at least once. Often the autobots will splinter into groups without their leader. If Megatron is also missing because Prime performed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> and sent them both to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">another dimension</a>, the Decepticons will be just as lost.

Hence, most major threats in the X-Men comic books will begin with Xavier either disappearing, losing his powers, falling into a coma, turning evil, or otherwise being rendered useless for the rest of the story. In the movie trilogy, Xavier spends at least half of each film out of commission, so the other characters will have to fight the battle. You might as well call having this power the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">Charles Xavier Superpower</a>.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">Anti-Life Equation</a> keeps much of the other major heroes occupied (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>) and leaves the saving of the world up to a few, mostly less-powerful heroes, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Flashes...</a></span>
</li><li> From DC Comics: So there were American superheroes in the 1940s, right? But having superheroes involved in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> that would disrupt the idea of the DC universe's similarity to the real world. So the Justice Society and their fellow patriotic heroes took a major Deus Exit Machina during World War II. The canon explanation is Hitler using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpearOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpearOfDestiny">The Spear of Destiny</a> to mind-control any superhero who got too close to Europe, and Hideki Tojo using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail">Holy Grail</a> to do the same thing with Japan; an Elseworlds tale instead had the heroes at the mercy of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">Power Nullifier</a> named Parsifal.
<ul><li> This wasn't canon at the time; the Spear of Destiny/Holy Grail was only brought up several decades later. At the time, they just had a lame explanation about Clark Kent failing the eye exam to join the army because he got excited and used his X-ray vision to read the eye chart in the next room. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless">They just kinda hoped nobody would notice that Superman never took the time to head over to Germany, grab Hitler, and end the war in 1942</a>. Another twist was that the Spear turns off any superpowers when they cross enemy lines.
</li><li> There was a Superman story published during World War II in which Superman told thousands of cheering GIs: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealHeroes">You fellows don't need my help</a>!" This was of course to explain why Superman didn't end the war in five seconds. And of course, during the Golden Age, Superman's powers were much weaker than they were later on: it's possible that he wasn't even able to fly across the Atlantic.
</li><li> In the early days of the comic, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster actually did do a three-page story called <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">"What If</a> Superman Ended the War?" He flies to Germany, grabs Hitler, then flies to Russia, grabs Stalin, ("Joe, meet Adolph!"), and then, with one tyrant in each hand, flies them both to a war crimes tribunal. The end!
</li></ul></li><li> Yet another Superman example: There was a much-hyped JLA story arc by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Superman gets sidelined in the very first issue, and stays that way pretty much throughout the arc. Since it was Claremont, Superman was (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">of course</a>) sidelined through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Control</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GLBlueLanternCorps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/GLBlueLanternCorps">Blue Lanterns</a></em> triple the power of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a></em> whenever they are nearby, so thanks to the writers, they are never available.

At one point, the characters actually need his help, but it turns out that the forefathers has unfortunately decided to give him a few nights of respite from his haunting right then.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em> has this in spades as Doc Ock knows that one smart person or a powerful telepath is enough to blow his cover. Sure enough, thanks to events like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em>, a number of brainier people and a number of telepaths are out of the picture.
<ul><li> Speaking of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em>, this was one of the major in-story reasons for the X-Men (or rather, "the mutants defending Hope", since about 1/4 of the then-active X-Men sided with the Avengers) to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">MAJORLY call the Avengers to task</a>: while the team was able to show up to stop every Tom, Dick and Harry in a super-suit from robbing a bank or instigating a small war, they were "somehow" never around while hundreds, thousands or <em>millions</em> of mutants went through everything from slavery to genetic experiments to genocide or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">even worse</a> without intervention. There needed to be some SERIOUS <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> moments after a talk like that to make the Avengers sympathetic again.

As the only Phoenix Force host still alive with actual experience, her presence could have easily prevented the event from getting as bad as it did.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnderworldUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnderworldUnleashed">Underworld Unleashed</a></em> runs with this: Neron seeks to obtain the purest of souls and immediately everyone assumes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a>. However, he's not there and many people think Superman was captured by Neron already. This wasn't the case: he was captured by off-world aliens and dragged through "The Trial of Superman" storyline, taking him, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Superboy">Superboy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Steel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Steel">Steel</a> with him.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Odin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">King of Asgard</a>, and stated at times to be as powerful as all of the thousands or more of other gods in Asgard—including Thor—combined. At his lowest he is casually manhandling Thor and at his peak he is remaking galaxies. So of course whenever Asgard is threatened Odin is conveniently in the Odinsleep replenishing his powers, weakened, or missing. The few times he does fight are when it is against a threat that can match him in power...making the rest of Asgard virtually useless. A good example of this is in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet">The Infinity Gauntlet</a></em>, where Odin gathers gods from other faiths and they all agree that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thanos">Thanos</a> <em>must</em> be stopped. But, just as they march out to save the day, a massive galaxy-wide quake shatters the Rainbow Bridge, trapping Odin and the other gods on Asgard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena">Avengers Arena</a></em> had <em>a lot</em> of this. In particular Mettle, Juston, and Darkhawk are incapacitated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or killed</span> within the first three issues. This is pretty much the only way the plot could function; all of them (especially Darkhawk) are powerful or skilled enough that if they actually took part in Arcade's "game" they could just effortlessly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingTheKnot">charge up to Arcade and smash him to paste</a> and derail his whole plan.

They don't make out alive of Year One, rendering the Insurgency struggle even more difficult since they are reduced to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">badass normals</a> and street-level superheroes.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a>, being the actual embodiment of God's wrath, is generally an unstoppable force that could solve nearly any crisis with a thought - probably by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrifyingHero">transforming the villain into a melting candle</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan3">Iron Man 3</a></em>, Tony spends a good deal of time in hiding with many people believing he was dead.

Additionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WarMachine">War Machine</a> spends much of the time on missions in the Middle East <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> or has his armor stolen</span>, so he couldn't help much, either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em>, as the name implies, has Thor traveling to the world of the dark elves, so he is not even on Earth.
</li><li> From all indications, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheWinterSoldier">Captain America: The Winter Soldier</a></em> has both Captain America and Black Widow on a secret mission against SHIELD double agents, so secrecy is also a top priority, much like in the Iron Man example.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em> obviously would not be helping out since he spends his time either as a normal scientist or a mindless monster who may cause more harm than good, so it's best for all involved if he lays low.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AntMan1">Ant-Man</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this by having Scott, having just been told by Hank the gravity of the situation they're in, responding by saying the first thing they should do is call in the Avengers.

Out-of-story, it is of course intentional given that either would seriously upset the balance of power if present. Besides, it is unlikely that Thor would want to be involved in Earthly politics and the Hulk is already on bad terms with the US government.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em>: Iron Man ALONE could have probably taken out the Vulture's entire operation.

During the climax, when the Vulture tries to rob Stark's plane, Peter gets Ned to call Happy in order to warn him. But because Peter had been texting and calling Happy ad nauseum for two months, Happy immediately gets annoyed and hangs up before Ned can get a word in.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersInfinityWar">Avengers: Infinity War</a></em>, during the Battle of Wakanda, Scarlet Witch is holed up with Vision in Shuri's lab.

<div class="indent"><strong>Okoye:</strong> Why was she up there all this time?!

Erek does briefly do away with the violence prohibition and he absolutely <em>slaughters</em> a force of Controllers.

<ul><li> <em>Philosopher's</em>/<em>Sorcerer's Stone</em>: Dumbledore is off at the Ministry of Magic when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quirrell decides to steal the Stone</span>. In this case, the summons he receives from the Ministry is fake, made so he'll be away when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Quirrell</span> carries out his plans.
</li><li> <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>: By the time Harry and Ron <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> discover the entrance to the Chamber</span>, Dumbledore has been suspended by the school governors.
</li><li> <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>: Played with, since its Dumbledore himself who tells Harry and Hermione <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">what to do</a>, because they were the only ones who could.
</li><li> <em>Goblet of Fire</em>: The bad guys pluck Harry off Hogwarts' grounds and deposit him miles away.
</li><li> <em>Order of the Phoenix</em>: Dumbledore is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TyrantTakesTheHelm">replaced by</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/HarryPotterMinistryOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/HarryPotterMinistryOfMagic">Dolores Umbridge</a> thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GovernmentConspiracy">Government Conspiracy</a>. Averted in the end, though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> since Dumbledore does show up, pwns the Death Eaters, and fights Voldemort one-on-one for the final battle</span>.
</li><li> <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>: Exception, Dumbledore takes part in the climax <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is killed</span>. Which also works as this trope for the series as a whole, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it was Voldemort's plan to get rid of Dumbledore first, and then try and take over the world</span>.
</li><li> It is eventually explained in book seven that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry needed to defeat Voldemort himself in the end, so Dumbledore had to let Harry build up enough skill over the years to do it. Unless he absolutely had to intervene, or if something happened he hadn't planned for, he let Harry do it, giving him just enough skills and information beforehand to let him succeed</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, Gandalf combines this with standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> heroics when he leaves Helm's Deep to fend for itself against the Uruk-Hai siege so he can gather troops for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment. Not really unexpected, given that he also left Thorin's party to check Dol Guldur in the middle of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>. Part of this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">implicit idea</a> Gandalf is conflicted on how much to affect events, which would make him too much like Saruman.
<ul><li> This happened in the first book too, when a Balrog dragged him into a chasm in Moria.
</li><li> On a larger scale, Higher Powers have forbidden him and the other wizards from engaging Sauron directly, out of the fear that doing so will destroy still more of the world.
</li><li> In fact, even the powers the wizards could use are extremely limited due to their physical "human" forms. It's unlikely Gandalf could have turned the tide at Helm's Deep alone, making his flight to gather reinforcements critical.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnfinishedTalesofNumenorAndMiddleearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/UnfinishedTalesofNumenorAndMiddleearth">Unfinished Tales</a></em> contains <em>The Quest for Erebor</em>, which is essentially Gandalf explaining all the things he was doing while he was absent for parts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, and how important they were.
</li><li> The Eagles are used as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Deus ex Machina</a> on several occasions in Lord of the Rings books to solve a particular problem, but for the purposes of this trope then vanish until next time despite the fact that they could easily bypass most of the trip using them, with even less justification for it given in the movies. This point is repeatedly parodied in several Lord of the Rings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HowItShouldHaveEnded">HISHEs.</a>
<ul><li> Tolkien himself was concerned about having used the Eagles in this manner and has hinted in some of his writings that the Eagles have a special connection to Eru and only appear at times of dire need, so they really <em>are</em> this trope.
</li><li> It has been pointed out the eagles probably would have been seen by Sauron and intercepted. Also the ring would probably have corrupted them.
</li></ul></li><li> In the First Age the Valar don't help Middle-Earth for over 500 years when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfEvil">Morgoth</a> flees there from Valinor. This is partially due to the Noldor being cursed due to the actions of their King <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Feanor</a>, who led the first killing of Elf by Elf. However this was also because attacking Morgoth in full force would damage Middle-Earth. Sure enough, when Morgoth is finally defeated in the War of Wrath, Beleriand, the North-West of Middle-Earth, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">ruined and sunk</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>The Call Of Cthulhu</em> sees the briefly awakened eponymous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> go back to "sleep" instead of destroying the world, in one of the rare villainous versions. There's a good reason for this, made clear in the story itself.
</li><li> Conan of REH's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a></em> series has this happen to him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWitchShallBeBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWitchShallBeBorn">A Witch Shall Be Born</a></em>. He gets captured by Salome's henchmen, and crucified outside the city gates; an Arabianesque fellow who happens to wander by takes Conan down. Conan joins his little bandit gang and spends a good deal of the story pillaging and doing things outside of the city-state of Khauran where most of the story transpires; leaving the young guard to be the hero of his own story.
<ul><li> Also in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeyondTheBlackRiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeyondTheBlackRiver">Beyond the Black River</a></em>, where Conan heads off to make sure one group of civilians are safe, leaving Balthus to do the real heroism as he arranges for people to be evacuated and covers their escape with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, saving many.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 7th <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Haruhi Suzumiya</a></em> novel, Mikuru gets <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kidnapped by some hostile organizations</span>. What follows is a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">carchase with Mori and Arakawa from the organization</span>. Of course, Kyon <em>could</em> have just <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">called Yuki for help, since she's just about omnipotent</span>. This is justified by a) there was not much time and Kyon was in serious panic and b) He doesn't like to rely on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuki</span>, because he already owes her enough. The best thing is when Kyon actually <em>thinks</em> what would have happened if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuki was involved</span>. To quote the man himself:
<div class="indent">"There's no way <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">four mere kidnappers could beat the formidable Nagato</span>, but I'd certainly look forward to such a scene."
</div></li><li> Michael Carpenter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> gets this a <em>lot</em>. In every appearance he makes Michael gets sidelined for some reason or another. He gets his sword stolen by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry's faerie godmother</span> in his first <em>appearance</em>, gets arrested for several days in Missouri in his second, and gets stuck in Oregon in his third appearance. It doesn't help that the last two occurrences were <em>off-screen</em>. He did get some badass fight scenes in <em>Death Masks</em> and <em>Small Favor</em> to make up for it though. It is also strongly implied that Michael is dramatically more powerful when God himself is giving him the task he's setting his blade to, turning him from a fairly strong hero with a big sword to a righteous force of pure, evil-smiting destruction.
<ul><li> In-universe, the use of this trope is justified in that the knights of the cross are expected to be good or virtuous in <em>all</em> things, so when they're not divinely mandated to be somewhere they're easily distracted by helping a little old lady cross the street, if they stop a mugging they'll also make their court date to stand as an honest witness, and so on. Their militant aspect is implied to be god's measure of last resort, so the call to action (and associated "right place at the right time" power) only activate if evil is otherwise inevitable. So long as Harry and his other allies have things in hand, God isn't going to hot-drop his personal SEAL team into the situation. Narratively, the trope is probably used just because Harry would be much less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAloner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAloner">The Aloner</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HurtingHero">Hurting Hero</a> if his powerful, competent friend were actually reliable.
<ul><li> Also justified by Harry himself, as Harry believes that Michael is a lot less powerful and therefore a lot more vulnerable when he isn't on the clock. Harry is therefore often reluctant to call him because he doesn't want Michael getting hurt.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted for once in <em>Small Favor</em> when Michael singlehandedly clears a train station of hundreds of Hobs. Only after Harry has cleared the myrk though, and meanwhile, Harry himself is occupied by fighting one big monster rather than hundreds of small ones.
</li><li> Happens to Harry himself at least twice.
<ul><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Mab takes his blasting rod and relevant memories,</span> in-universe, it's because that kind of magic would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsAMonsterMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicIsAMonsterMagnet">attract the kind of monsters he was dealing with</a>. Narratively, it's because he could have taken them apart easily with his usual resources, and she only did it at the point in the story where they didn't matter anymore.
</li><li> When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he is dead, Chicago becomes much less safe for ordinary people and his friends</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame">Skin Game</a></em>, Nicodemus sends a few of his minions to cause a potential nuclear crisis in the middle-east just to get Sanya out of the picture before the book even starts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not to be outdone by the forces of evil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelUriel">Archangel Uriel</a> temporarily re-powers Michael, so Nicodemus has to deal with a Knight of the Cross anyway.</span>

</li><li> Buffy runs away from her friends and mother after having to kill her lover. They manage to hold down the fort, though not nearly as well without Buffy. Some spend an entire summer wishing she was back or actively trying to find her.
</li><li> In Season Eight, during the first arc, evil witch Amy traps Buffy in a nightmare while she attacks the Scooby Gang's new castle HQ with an army of zombies. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They are saved by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">Willow</a>.

However, Amy's plan backfires when Buffy is able to use what in the dream Amy trapped her in to defeat Amy.</span>
</li><li> Several times in season 3, Faith disappeared for an episode so that the presence of a second Slayer didn't make the Threat of the Week too easy to beat. Most notable is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E12Helpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS3E12Helpless">Helpless</a>", where Buffy is robbed of her powers by the Council; there's a brief line at the start saying that Faith is "on one of her unannounced walkabouts", and no more mention is made of her.

<ul><li> Occasionally happened in the original series when an actor went on vacation.
</li><li> Let's not forget all the times K-9 was temporarily out of commission during the Tom Baker years. In fact, Baker lampshaded this in a blooper.
</li><li> During the Fifth Doctor era, this was done to the sonic screwdriver. It was destroyed and he never built another one for the duration of the original series.
</li><li> This trope was one of the reasons that the new series rendered the Doctor the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">Last of His Kind</a>, so that when things really hit the fan no-one would wonder why the Time Lords didn't decide to use their great smiting powers as they had done on a few occasions in the original series.
<ul><li> The Time Lords return eventually, but they are in another universe and <em>The Time of the Doctor</em> shows them returning would trigger a new Time War. Downplayed when they are able to give the Doctor a new regeneration cycle, which enables him to regenerate and destroy the Daleks.

It is later revealed that he did this on purpose, to give the family of aliens chasing him an opportunity to simply walk away safely. When he is forced to turn Time Lord again, he easily dishes out horrible punishments to all of the family.
<ul><li> So easily, in fact, that it happens off-screen.

<ul><li> Tyrion Lannister, on two separate occasions, is forced to have a trial by combat to save himself. Fortunately for him, his brother Jaime is one of the best swordsmen in recent memory and is more than willing to fight for his brother's life.

</li><li> Much of the conflict in Meereen in Season 6 involving the slave owners and Sons of the Harpy trying to retake the city is only possible because Daenerys had to escape a Harpy attack on Drogon, and was left stranded in the wilderness - where she was captured by the Dothraki. Once she escapes and frees her dragons, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>.
</li><li> When Daenerys finally reaches Westeros, the only reason Cersei isn't dethroned immediately is because Daenerys chooses to deal with the White Walkers in the North first.
</li></ul></li><li> Here we go: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>...
<ul><li> The Haitian (whose power is to nullify everyone else's superpowers) is conveniently absent whenever things get really crazy. Heck, the first season finale could have been completely avoided if The Haitian had simply walked up to Sylar and shot him in the head (then again, that probably wouldn't have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitRoulette">according to The Plan</a>).
<ul><li> He finally makes himself useful in the second-to-last episode of Season 3, where he's the key to defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> Volume 4 revolves around a secret government unit out to capture and imprison every last special. That's a job <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">the Haitian</a> could do overnight if their commander weren't so hell-bent on making it all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">us vs. them</a> and probably explains his complete absence during that entire arc.
</li></ul></li><li> Peter could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboPlatterPowers">the most overpowering character</a> on the show, but he's held in check by a fatal combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForgotAboutHisPowers">Forgot About His Powers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoconutSuperpowers">Coconut Superpowers</a> (in that if he doesn't already know he has powers, they're the type of powers that not noticing is fairly logical), this trope, and his pet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>.
</li><li> Likewise Sylar on the villain side. He spent much of the first season locked up and/or catatonic and much of the second season suffering a bad case of being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Brought Down to Normal</a>.
</li><li> The most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> of these was probably in the third volume when Hiro was given the mind of a 10 year old to prevent him interfering, before the volume's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> completely stripped him of his power</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that they're trying to write out time-traveling powers from the storyline so they won't have to keep doing this to characters.
</li><li> Matt Parkman is also a popular victim of this trope after his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> start expanding in Volume Three. In fact, in each <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> from Volume Three on, the writers made sure that Parkman was either on the complete other side of the country from the battle or <em>en route</em> and only arriving shortly after the dust had started to settle.
</li></ul></li><li> Sort of done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">Knight Rider</a></em> in various ways. When you have a nearly-indestructible sentient supercar, sometimes you have to come up with ways of incapacitating it in order to allow for <em>some</em> drama. This usually involved Michael getting himself somewhere KITT couldn't make it (not that that didn't stop him from turbo boosting into a high-story apartment once...), KITT being incapacitated or stolen/hacked by some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, or outright damaged/destroyed by something. This was never permanent, despite the anxiety it caused, and the Big Bads usually seemed to give them plenty of time to repair/recapture KITT unhindered.
<ul><li> The reverse was done a time or two as well, with Michael being unavailable. This was mostly played for laughs by showing KITT trying to cope with a new driver and failing.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>, whenever the CO (Henry Blake in early seasons, Sherman Potter in later seasons) was away, Frank would go about creating his own rules, which created drama that couldn't have happened with the CO present.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>:
<ul><li> The writers didn't even bother trying to justify why Merlin didn't just call the Great Dragon to his aid every time Morgana took over Camelot. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWank">Fan Wank</a> tried to fill in some of the gaps (that Arthur believed he'd killed it, that Merlin didn't want to expose his secret) but it still caused some credibility issues.
</li><li> In the latter half of the series, Merlin became this. It's hard to write a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> that the hero can kill without even moving, so the plots were either things that he couldn't solve by just killing the problem or got him out of the way.
</li></ul></li><li> Rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Rangers</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PowerRangers">Power Rangers</a></em> who don't suffer depowering courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsDumb">Good Is Dumb</a> get saddled with this instead, with the exception of the even-rarer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualLoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualLoner">Ineffectual Loner</a> Ranger. This is usually the case with team additions who start out evil; once they turn good, excuses are made for them not to be on the field of battle rather than run the risk of suffering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassDecay">Badass Decay</a>. These excuses can go as far as half-season absences while they're off researching enemy motives, to as little as being so constantly late they couldn't hold a proper job if they ever tried to get one.
<ul><li> Udonna from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersMysticForce">Power Rangers Mystic Force</a></em> loses her staff that lets her become the White Mystic Ranger for most of the season, but she's still a powerful sorceress. Yet whenever the Rangers have a problem that she should be able to solve in a matter of seconds, she is nowhere to be seen, let alone mentioned. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note382cq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note382cq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note382cq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Probably helps that her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MahouSentaiMagiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MahouSentaiMagiranger">Mahou Sentai Magiranger</a></em> counterpart, Magi Mother, is <em>dead</em> through most of that series</span>
</li><li> Commander Cruger of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersSPD">Power Rangers S.P.D.</a></em> at least justifies his absences when he explains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpingWouldBeKillstealing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpingWouldBeKillstealing">Helping Would Be Killstealing</a>.
</li><li> And of course, the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> had Tommy and his "swiss cheese brain" that would cause him to forget important things (like his morpher on at least one occasion) and be unavailable to fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>. Other times there'd be a different reason, such as him caught up in the middle of a fight elsewhere, or injured in a previous attack which forced him to wait on the sidelines for a bit. This had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> explanation as well, since Tommy's Japanese counterpart pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> and wasn't around nearly as much, a problem rectified by Toei producing brand-new suit footage for the second season.
<ul><li> In Tommy's introduction, the "Green With Evil" miniseries, the first thing Rita Repulsa does with her new evil Ranger is get him into the Command Center and cut Zordon off from Earth so he can't intervene. The Rangers are subsequently stuck on the defensive until they can reestablish contact.
</li></ul></li><li> Notably subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersDinoCharge">Power Rangers Dino Charge</a></em>, wherein The Gold Ranger is both a part of the main cast, appearing in every episode after his introduction and is considerably stronger than the original five.
<ul><li> Played with in the case of The Graphite Ranger, who does disappear, but this is justified in that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he's the crown prince of an entire country</span> and thus, obviously, has other responsibilities that demand his attention.
</li></ul></li><li> This is usually carried over from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>, whose fans refer to the trope as "Sixth Ranger Syndrome." Prominent examples are Genta/ShinkenGold in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SamuraiSentaiShinkenger">Samurai Sentai Shinkenger</a></em>, who would either be running his sushi stand during important battles or sent off on completely separate missions from the rest of the team; Gai/GokaiSilver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KaizokuSentaiGokaiger">Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger</a></em>, who breaks his arm as an excuse to have him stop fighting for several episodes. He also is mostly absent, without much excuse, from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>; and Yuusaku/MegaSilver in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenjiSentaiMegaranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DenjiSentaiMegaranger">Denji Sentai Megaranger</a></em>, deliberately written so that at the start of the show the character could not transform for more than a few minutes at a time due to a fault with his suit (and when he fixes it, the suit loses a lot of its power.); Jin Masato and Beet J. Stag of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters">Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters</a></em> often will show up later without explanation, after the main three are already in the heat of battle.
</li><li> An inversion of this occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MahouSentaiMagiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MahouSentaiMagiranger">Mahou Sentai Magiranger</a></em>, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Magi</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MentorArchetype">Shine</a> sends the rest of the team off on a training exercise while he deals with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a> by himself. After that point though, its played straight, with a couple of episodes consists of the main team catching up to him, while he have his own business to deal with elsewhere before he returned in top shape and kicking ass.
</li></ul></li><li> Scott Sherwood is missing from the Halloween episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RememberWENN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RememberWENN">Remember WENN</a></em> with no explanation. One fansite speculated that it was because a character as sneaky as him would have seen through the central deception immediately.
</li><li> This is done to various alien races and civilizations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em> to keep the protagonists from getting too powerful, too fast. Most of them hide behind some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Alien Non-Interference Clause</a>, but in some cases it's just because they are exceptionally difficult to contact, or when they are contacted they are "too busy".
<ul><li> The Nox decided to cut themselves off because they think that everyone else is too "young" and that they won't know how to keep from killing themselves and everyone else if given advanced technology. That's fine and all, but they seem to take it to an extreme.
</li><li> The Tollans are afraid to give away tech after they watched the people of their neighboring planet kill themselves with the stuff they gave them. They <em>do</em> at least make alliance with Earth and help out from time to time, but they still don't offer any knowledge or technology.
</li><li> The Tok'ra seem to expect more of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansByAnyOtherName">Tau'ri</a> than we're permitted to expect of them, despite being among Earth's closest allies. They're more than happy to give the SGC something to do or use SG-1 as their personal test subjects, but try to call them and either the line doesn't get through or you get a busy signal. Then they have the gall to criticize the Tau'ri for acting without them, or doing it the wrong way. Where the hell were you then?
<ul><li> O'Neill often lampshades this, and resents the Tok'ra for never being there when they need help, but repeatedly getting SG-1 to go on stupendously dangerous missions for them.
</li></ul></li><li> The Asgard at least <em>do</em> help out and give technology and whatnot, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">unfortunately</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloningBlues">they have their own problems to deal with</a>. If they could have sent in a full Asgard battle fleet, they could have easily walked all over the Goa'uld.
</li><li> What Ancient allies we do run into never stick around more than an episode or two, most often thanks to the rest of their kind enforcing their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeglectfulPrecursors">Neglectful Precursor</a> ways and stopping them before they can do anything more than point the good guys in the right direction.
</li></ul></li><li> A number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episodes had Deanna Troi absent for at least part of the story, because otherwise her telepathic abilities would have brought the episode to a resolution in a matter of a few minutes.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>, having Castiel around and fully angeled-up is basically the Easy Button. So he gets hit with this a lot.
<ul><li> The first time, he time travels back to when the Winchesters' parents were still alive, and the effort alone nearly kills him.
</li><li> The second time, he branded an anti-angel sigil on his chest to send a bunch of angelic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> to God-knows-where. This had the nasty side effect of sending <em>him</em> to God-knows-where, as well as stripping him of his remaining powers.
</li><li> The third time, Castiel is busy fighting an offscreen civil war in Heaven <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and being one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble">Big Bad Ensemble</a> of the season</span>.
</li><li> The fourth time, after he absorbs every soul in Purgatory, he is soon "killed" by the Leviathans growing inside of him. He later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexplainedRecovery">reappears</a>, believing he's human and without any memory of being an angel, and gets his memory back just in time for...
</li><li> The fifth time, where he absorbs Sam's memory of being in Hell, which drives him crazy and has him committed in a hospital.
</li><li> The sixth time, he gets stuck in Purgatory with Dean but stays behind when Dean manages to escape. He is saved by Naomi, who makes him her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a> and prevents him from helping the Winchesters any more than necessary.

So he left and never came back during the show's run; the showrunners later said they didn't have the time to add a scene addressing him right after the final, where he's floating in space several parsecs away wondering if it's safe to return.
</li><li> And, of course, there was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">The Greatest Story Never Told</a>", an episode focusing on perpetual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a>, who had to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceIsBad">an alternative power source gone berserk</a> while the entire rest of the League battled a godlike foe.

</li><li> Subverted in "In Blackest Night, Part I", which very conspicuously pointed out that Supes was busy with an earthquake in India...only to have him show up halfway through the episode anyway.

</li><li> And in the episode "Patriot Act," the entire rest of the League is busy, so the five non-powered heroes who were available are sent to walk in a parade in Metropolis, later to be joined by two (also non-powered) reservists to deal with the newly superhuman General Eiling.

<ul><li> In the series finale, Iroh refuses to fight Fire Lord Ozai because — even assuming he won — it would not bring true peace, being ultimately nothing more than "a brother killing a brother for power." This leaves it up to our plucky hero Aang to face the Fire Lord himself.
</li><li> In "The Desert" episode, Katara has to lead the group because Aang's too upset over Appa, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntoxicationEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntoxicationEnsues">Sokka is high</a>, and Toph can't see (she's blind and senses vibrations) because of the loose sand they're walking on.
</li><li> Appa himself: he lives and breathes this trope for the entire series. For the record, Appa is a ten-ton (that's twenty-thousand pound) six-legged flying bison with horns. Yet he's only in three battles throughout the whole series and only attacks people in one of them. Case in point: in "Jet" he is literally five yards behind the group as they're walking through a forest, but as soon as they stumble into a Fire Nation camp and get attacked, he's nowhere to be seen. The writers don't even give him an excuse, he's just gone.
</li><li> Not including Aang in the Avatar State, Toph is the strongest bender on the team, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> and usually doesn't have Katara's weakness of lack of element. She's occasionally separated from the main team to create tension and give the enemies a fighting chance. In "The Library", she doesn't go inside meaning that Wan Shi Tong sinking the library is a real threat and in "Crossroads of Destiny" she's on a mission to rescue Bosco instead of being in the catacombs where she could have ended the fight in a second.
</li><li> In the second season finale, Aang unlocks his chakras, allowing him to enter and exit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">the Avatar State</a> at will. During his next transformation, Azula sucker-punches him with lightning, closing his last chakra and preventing him from entering the Avatar State. While fighting Ozai in the series finale, a strike in just the right place unblocks that chakra, and Aang finishes the fight quickly.

This is lampshaded when she returns, where the first thing she says is that she should have been there since she could have handled it. In the comics, she didn't exist as a character yet, and so she wasn't around to absorb the rescued astronaut's piloting skills and calmly bring down the shuttle as the solar radiation harmlessly bounced off her invulnerable body, with the astronauts and other X-Men safely in the shielded area. No fuss, no muss, no unstable cosmic entity.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> was subject to this in two occasions in the series ("Reunion (Part 2)", and "The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 1): Dazzled"). In both cases, the X-Men were defeated in battle and imprisoned and had their powers nullified in some way (the nature of the savage lands in the former and through special handcuffs in the latter). For Wolverine, this would make the inevitable breakout easy due to his adamantium claws since even in today's comics his claws are unaffected by power nullifiers and could cut through anything including the prison bars for the former and the handcuffs in the latter. Hence why at the beginning of each fight Wolverine would be taken out quite early (thrown off a waterfall in "Reunion (Part 2)" and smashed 5 floors into a sewer by Harry Leland in "The Dark Phoenix Saga (Part 1): Dazzled".) Arguably, this helped his character as it gave him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> moment.
</li><li> Another Wolverine example comes from Scott and Jean's wedding (the first one). Wolverine is busy slicing up holographic enemies (some that bear striking resemblance to "Slim" Summers) in his tux during the nuptials. The poor hairy, Canadian shmuck can't stand seeing the object of his affection married off to Cyke. Had he chosen to attend, he would've revealed the big shocker that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not only was Morph alive, he was impersonating the Priest as part of a plan to destroy his former comrades</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Often happens to Jake in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>, usually without any explanation beyond his laziness (when they even explain it that much; often he's simply absent). For example, in "It Came From the Nightosphere," Jake is nowhere to be seen. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> That is, until the end, when it is revealed that he was shrunken down and residing inside a pocket of Finn's shirt the whole time for some reason.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em> Alien X is basically a god. They write him out by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">making him unable to use his powers without a quorum from Ben and two very opposed personalities. And Ben can't just agree with whichever of the personalities (the pacifist or the violent one) is more in line with whatever needs doing at the moment, because they have <em>thousands of years</em> worth of decisions that they demand be addressed first before they'll move on to the current crisis. It's only in exceptionally rare situations that Ben can convince them to deal with the current situation first, and he has difficulty even convincing them to let him leave! As a result, Ben and Kevin hacked the Omnitrix to lock it from ever transforming into Alien X again, a lock that's only to be removed when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> is crossed</span>. As a result, fans started calling that season "Ben 9 Alien Force".
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, Optimus Primal's transformation into Optimal Optimus made him larger and more powerful but for the most part, it just made him a bigger target for any Predacon knockout dart that would take him out before he could curb-stomp the Predacons. Rarely did he make an appearance after his initial debut that didn't have him getting blasted or brainwashed, forcing the Maximals to deal with the threat on their own.
<ul><li> Tigerhawk, who is introduced with Earth-shattering (literally) power in the 3rd season, then a few episodes later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Megatron, in control of the Nemesis ship, promptly annihilates him before the series finale</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>: periodically the Justice League are left indisposed so there's a reason the titular team have to be taking on the biggest issues. In the first season finale <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Justice League <em>were</em> the threat because they were being mind-controlled.</span> Partway into the second season <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most of the league's strongest members are forced off-world to take responsibility for action they were made to do during said period</span>, and in the third season, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">most are offworld again, this time to rescue metahuman children trafficked into space, while the League also undergoes a schism due to Lex Luthor's manipulations causing several members, most prominently Batman and Green Arrow, to leave the League</span>.
<ul><li> Within the main cast, you'll rarely see the entire team together, especially in the second season. A lot of it has to do with budgetary issues, so you'll often have at least several members of the team absent in each episode.
</li><li> It quickly becomes clear that The Light are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">constantly invoking this</a> as a regular strategy. Many of the threats the Team deals with are the more profitable operations for the Light, while the Justice League is off fighting a much larger and much flashier distraction.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>
<ul><li> Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are the rulers of Equestria and close personal friends of the protagonists, and are capable of truly incredible displays of power, such as raising the sun and moon every day with little effort. The full extent of their power isn't clear, but they're obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">the most powerful good guys in the setting</a>. Yet whenever a serious threat rears its head, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">they're never as helpful as their powers suggest they'd be</a>. Celestia is usually given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> as to why she doesn't help - either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">she set things up herself</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">she's intentionally holding back so as not to hurt someone</a> - but Luna rarely gets such a Hand Wave.
</li><li> With her ascension to princesshood and impressive combo platter of powers (including but not limited to flight, teleportation, levitation, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">Frickin' Laser Beams</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomenessByAnalysis">Awesomeness by Analysis</a>), Twilight is now finding herself in this situation as well. <em>Especially</em> after Season 5, which introduced a gigantic map that pretty much tells the ponies where to go, leaving Twilight to be stuck and unable to help because, quite literally, the map says only certain ponies can help.
</li><li> Spike is off watching a hoofball game with Big Macintosh during the events of "The Cutie Map", probably because the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> of that story's main threat revolves around taking away Cutie Marks, which obviously wouldn't affect him, and also that he could just call Princess Celestia to send backup.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> of Season 8 invokes this in "School Raze." They give a key that can unlock any door to the main characters to open the gates of Tartarus, intentionally not telling the heroes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">It Only Works Once</a>. By the time the Mane Six figure this out, they're stuck, leaving the villain to execute their plans without the heroes interfering.
</li></ul></li><li> The main plots in the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WolverineAndTheXMen">Wolverine and the X-Men</a></em> relied almost entirely on covert operations and intelligence gathering, and having the wool pulled over the X-Men's eyes more than once. So Jean Grey and Professor X were put into comas (to remove their reducing these plot elements to mere annoyances for the team) and replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> (who is weaker than Jean and Charles in powerset and skill, not as trustworthy so the others would be hesitant to come to her about their problems <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and who was responsible for putting Jean and the professor in their comas to aid her plot with the Inner Circle</span>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RubyGloom">Ruby Gloom</a></em> episode "Shaken, Not Scared" follows Boo-Boo as he attempts to scare Ruby and her friends so he can become a full ghost. The easily frightened Scaredy Bat is mysteriously absent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventuresOfTheGalaxyRangers">Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers</a></em> had an unusual set up with four main cast members, and often used <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty">Plot Tailored to the Party</a>, but just as often pulled this by having an episode where it was one or two Rangers and their skillsets weren't going to help much in the situation. The most prominent example was "Mistwalker," where Zachary and Zozo were stuck on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> where their technology failed. The episode's guest star points out that Niko's psionics and science background would have been much more useful to the situation than Zachary's military training and Zozo's diplomacy.
