<ul><li> Goku frequently underestimates just how evil some people can be, and is all too willing to assume they aren't lying to him when he has them at his mercy. He is shocked that Raditz was lying after he pleas for his life, claiming that he will leave Earth peacefully if his life is spared. The moment Goku let go of his tail, Raditz kicks him, crushes his ribs, and calls him an idiot for believing him. He also spares Frieza's life on two separate occasions (in <em>Z</em> and <em>Resurrection 'F</em>') out of a misguided act of mercy, and both times Frieza took advantage of it. Finally, in <em>Super</em>, he completely misreads Zamasu, seeing him as a good Kai and not believing he has anything to do with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Goku Black</a>, despite Zamasu showing open hostilities towards him during their visit and even trying to attack Goku after losing a sparring match.

Even after Zamasu cuts down an inhabitant of Planet Babari rather than just walking away, this being <em>right after</em> Zamasu openly suggested that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">just wipe out all of the Babarians and be done with it</a>, Gowasu is still willing to believe the best in him and believes that after their visit and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">subsequent lecture over the Babarian's death</a>, Zamasu has finally learned his lesson.

For this reason, Gowasu refuses to personally choose any fighters for the Tournament of Power, fearing he may end up choosing someone as insane as Zamasu.

</li><li> Jamitov himself is one of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Zeta Gundam</a></em>. He chooses Bosque as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a>, Jerid Messa as his disciple, and recruits Paptimus Scirocco from the Jupiter Energy Fleet, giving him the best ship in the fleet and allowing him to accumulate a great deal of power under him. The thing is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneAdmiral">Bosque</a> doesn't care about Jamitov's agenda and just wants to kill every Spacenoid he can catch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceptiveDisciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceptiveDisciple">Jerid</a> plans to eventually supplant Jamitov, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Scirocco</a> plans to supplant Jamitov <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">without the 'eventually'</a>.

The deal they cut with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Char</a> basically amounts to: "In return for not dropping your space rocks on us, we'd like to give you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a giant space rock! And as an extra bonus, it's loaded with nukes!</span>"
</li><li> Really, after a certain point it stops being humorous and becomes worrying. One has to wonder if the Earth Federation has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProtectionRacket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterProtectionRacket">terrorism insurance policy</a> on the planet Earth and is desperately trying to cash in on it.
</li><li> To the above question, ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn</a>" says <strong>YES</strong>. According to various Zeon scholars, more Terrorists = more defense funding for various Federation bureaucrats, which gives them an incentive to secretly fund various terrorist cells into making a bloody fuss and restarting the war on small scales, all so the Military Complex can justify its ridiculous budget. And in nearly every situation, the Federation conspirators underestimate just how bitter and ruthless the Zeon 'strawmen' can become with 'scraps' when they have suffered numerous nation-wide defeats and institutionalized racism.
</li><li> This eventually comes to a resolution in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MobileSuitCrossboneGundam">Crossbone Gundam</a></em>, where it's revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Jupiter Energy Fleet has been manipulating both the Federation and the various incarnations of Zeon, with their stated goal under Fonse Kagatie being to weaken the Feds enough to where they can eventually overthrow them and establish total hegemony over the Earth Sphere</span>.

She met Hell in college when she was a student, and she thought despite his quirkiness he was a good person. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Dr</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">HELL</a>.</em> His sanity was already slipping, he was beginning to look <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> and he was troubled and paranoiac and prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a>.

</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doubt">Doubt</a></em>, we have Yuu. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">nice guy</a> who is stuck with his friends in an abandoned place and one of them is killing the others. And despite one of their members being a delinquent with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> who was willing to <em>beat him up</em> after Yuu accidentally bumped into him and another is an aloof, mysterious guy who seems to know more than he lets on, he still thinks it's all an outside job. Though he eventually does wonder in later chapters whether one of them <em>did</em> kill everyone in their group.
</li><li> Lithuania from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>. His boss Russia is a male <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a>, his crush Belarus is Russia's sister <em>and</em> a Yandere as well, his best friend is the often selfish Poland (though in Poland's defense, he <em>does</em> attempt to help him with Russia more than once, and clearly stands up to Russia in <em>Meeting of the World</em>). However, this trope only applies to his one-sided crush on Belarus, as he expresses frustration in dealing with Russia and Poland, and deals with them because he has to, and he makes the best of a bad situation.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero">Fate/Zero</a></em> Kirei Kotomine seems to simply inspire trust. Risei trusts him unconditionally (though this is kind of justified as Kirei is Risei's son) and Tokiomi Tohsaka notes that he seems more nihilistic than faithful or religious yet he also trusts him immensely and it never occurs to him that Kirei might not be the most loyal person on earth. Even Assassin believes that Archer (aka Gilgamesh) is no problem at all when Assassins are implied to <em>never</em> get into direct fights. Bazett also trusts Kotomine a bit too much.
<ul><li> Tokiomi eventually takes this to ridiculous extremes by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">writing what is essentially his will, which says Kirei gets everything (including his daughter)</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">giving him a</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">knife</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">as a parting gift, then walking away from him with his back turned</a>. You can guess how well <em>that</em> ended. He also gave his youngest daughter to Zouken Matou, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">predictable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory">results</a>.

He <em>does</em> realize that the villains aren't the nicest people on earth, but is very naive about wishing to believe the best in people (namely, Rokudo Mukuro). It's lampshaded by several characters in the series (yes, even by the villains themselves).
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em>, Whispy Woods took the word of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardCarryingVillain">King Dedede</a> that someone is out to destroy his forest, and assumed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Kirby</a> and the gang were the ones out to destroy it because they happened to put a fire next to Whispy while they were camping out. If Kirby hadn't eaten one of the apples Whispy was dropping on the gang, then his judge of character would've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">caused his woods to be destroyed forever, replaced by Dedede's golf course</a>.

Even after being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">abandoned on a remote, barren farm</span>, she makes up an excuse for it herself and remains eager to do his bidding. Sure, the girl <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeSpecial">desperate to be the heroine</a>, but <em>still</em>!
</li><li> Prince Diamond of season 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> refuses to hear anyone question the motives of his adviser Wiseman. A skeleton with glowing hands and eyes. Who wears a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackCloak">Black Cloak</a>. Who had previously appeared before them very suddenly offering them his wisdom and the power of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Evil Black Poison Crystal</a>. In his defense, he's also the ruler of a planet of people exiled by the kingdom of Crystal Tokyo, so he's not stable. This all only applies to the anime, because in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a>, the Black Moon Clan were evil and Demand was pure evil, so nobody really cared much about Wiseman since they were all after the same goal.
<ul><li> In the same storyline and also in the anime, Cooan is revealed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">to be in love with Rubius</a>, who is completely evil and clearly using her. Learning the obvious is what leads her and the other three Ayakashi Sisters to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A cynic could very well consider Akane Tendo of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em> to be one of these. She is convinced that Ryoga Hibiki is a sweet, gentle, kind-hearted person and her best friend. While he <em>does</em> make some good character growth, Ryoga is very flawed as well: petty, melancholic, obsessive, childish, and obsessed with wooing her, and her blindness to his romantic intentions is one of the things that upsets him the most. She blatantly ignores things like the fact he was once part of a plot to kidnap her because he does things like choke down her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">repulsive food</a> and lie that it tastes delicious, immediately leaps to assault Ranma when Akane gets angry or upset, and otherwise goes out of his way to stroke her ego. In fact, it's possible that <em>this</em> is the keystone behind her apparent inability to realise he is really her pet pig P-chan: she thinks so highly of him that she can't conceive he would abuse her trust and stain her honor the way that pretending to be an animal so he can, among other things, sleep in her bed.
<ul><li> Given her trust levels for Ranma, the same could be applied there. While Ranma is hardly a model citizen, Akane is generally willing to accuse Ranma of all sorts of immoral actions that he would never take, or has shown any sign of taking. Most notably is her insistence that Ranma is a pervert, despite the fact that Ranma never shows any kind of lust and never abuses his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Bender</a> curse to go peeping. Ranma is guilty of many things, but he is all but immune to lust.

<ul><li> Though in Graham's case, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">isn't that different from Ladd</a> personality-wise. It's just as likely that Graham is well aware of what kind of man Ladd is, but is so violently insane himself that he likes it!

</li><li> Of course, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Faker himself was an even bigger example.

One murder and an attempt on Ken's own life later, he wises up to Kase's conniving ways, but it takes <em>another</em> attempt on Ken's life before he actually does anything about it—which, for those of you playing along at home, would be the <em>third</em> time Kase's tried, and failed, to kill him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>, there are a few cases of this:
<ul><li> The main character himself is a rare justified example. He's rather clueless regarding normal human interactions due to his isolation by the villagers and peers until he became a ninja, so he tended to trust people who showed an outward facade of friendliness (he was very starved for positive attention). His former teacher Mizuki, appeared to be the nice teacher to Umino Iruka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SternTeacher">Stern Teacher</a>, tricked Naruto into stealing the Forbidden Scroll and then planned to kill him, and Kabuto, who was an agent for Orochimaru for years and only pretended to be a friendly upperclassman. Ironically, Sasuke was the only one from Team 7 who realized there was something off about Kabuto before his second encounter with his brother.
</li><li> The biggest example, however, would be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Third Hokage, who actually allowed Shimura Danzo to reform ROOT after the Fourth Hokage had disbanded the shadow group because he felt he needed someone to take care of the dirty deeds that couldn't be linked to the village. The Fourth ended up being right in not trusting ROOT; Danzo schemed for years to oust Sarutobi to become Hokage himself, going as far as seeking assistance from foreign powers to do so, enabling Orochimaru's experiments and even forced the Uchiha coup to be unable to resolve peacefully by removing the eye of Uchiha Shisui, who planned to use it to pacify his clan, only to transplant it to himself so he could use its superior hypnotic capabilities to get his way.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Ayase of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OkaneGaNai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OkaneGaNai">Okane ga Nai</a></em>: his cousin <em>sold him to the Yakuza</em> and he thinks it was just a "misunderstanding." This is also the guy who surrounds himself with "friends" who - without exception - are trying to get in his pants. And he keeps thinking that it's also just a "misunderstanding" when one of his "best friends" tries to rape him. Twice. And then chain him to a bedpost in his room.

Yeah, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">just a great guy</a>.
</li><li> Asuna's father Shouzou in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> thinks Sugou is a friendly, bright little protege, and arranges a marriage between the two without noticing that his daughter hates the evil bastard.

Of course, Sugou made sure to act like an honest, kind man to his boss, and only let the facade drop in front of Kirito, whom he believed wouldn't be able to do anything about the marriage.
<ul><li> Asuna's mother Kyouko is just as bad about it as her husband, since according to Asuna herself, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> between Asuna and Sugou was <em>her</em> idea in the first place; of course, when Asuna points this out to her, Kyouko <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">quickly tries to deflect the blame onto her husband</a>.

This is most notable with the Fox and the Cat, who are really interested in stealing the money Mangiafuoco gave to Pinocchio. Before they do the theft, there are too many clues that they are not the good guys they pretend to be: they clearly keep feigning handicaps, call Pinocchio in a pretty suspicious way, tell Pinocchio that school is the reason for their handicaps, kill a blackbird that tries to warn Pinocchio, leave Pinocchio to pay for all the food they ate, arrange a meeting in midnight and almost kill him (they were disguised, but Pinocchio managed to bite off the Cat's paw and could have discovered all). But Pinocchio still believes their lies until the theft. Later, Pinocchio trusts the worst students in his class, even if his teacher and the Fairy advised him not to. For that, those students trick him to skip school and when one of them gets hit and faints, the rest scapegoat Pinocchio.

That being said, it's all but stated he's projecting James onto Harry, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and only because he can't stand the fact that the woman he loved chose another man over him (with Harry being the living reminder of that)</span>.
</li><li> Cornelius Fudge in regards to Lucius Malfoy. Bribery might be involved.

</li><li> The Sorting Hat is a good judge of character but lets itself be swayed by students who have a strong preference for a house other than the one the Hat would have chosen. We see this expressly with Harry, but it's hinted with Snape (on the train to Hogwarts he expressed a strong preference for Slytherin, even though he had a lot of Gryffindor traits, to the point that Dumbledore wonders whether the Hat might have placed him differently if it were given the chance to reconsider). And it doesn't take too much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> to imagine the Hat also considered James Potter (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">arrogant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius">rulebreaking prodigy</a> that he was as a youth) in Ravenclaw, but granted him his strong wish (also expressed on the train) to be in Gryffindor. And putting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">Peter Pettigrew</a></em> in Gryffindor as well? (It's worth mentioning that while the Hat stood by its earlier opinion that Harry would have done admirably in Slytherin, Dumbledore disagreed completely in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheChamberOfSecrets">The Chamber of Secrets</a></em>, claiming that only a student who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Godric Gryffindor</a> himself had favored could have drawn his sword out of the Hat.)
</li><li> Albus Dumbledore is nominally a subversion, with one exception in his youth: Gellert Grindelwald, who was the love of his life before becoming Wizard Hitler and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>. He also exploited Dumbledore's love for him in hopes of Dumbledore joining him to achieve those goals, until Ariana's death snapped Dumbledore out of it. It's implied that this bad experience with Grindelwald is why Dumbledore was able to peg the true nature of Tom Riddle (the future Lord Voldemort) years later.

</li><li> Sansa is this at first with regards to Joffrey and Cersei, but she eventually becomes disillusioned. Other than that, though, she's generally a pretty good judge of character — she's one of the few people who immediately recognized <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Littlefinger</a> as being a dangerous creep — and this has only been improving as she acquires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadeColoredGlasses">Jade-Colored Glasses</a>.

Roland Sullivan is <em>Lethal Justice</em> is very much this. He felt such lust for Arden Gillespie that he cheated on his wife, and essentially became Arden's puppet. Even when the consequences finally start hitting him, he refuses to leave Arden. He even figured out at a very late date that Arden had no conscience, and she confirmed it when he asked her. He still did not leave her. This just shows that Roland is a real piece of work!

<ul><li> In general, whenever Poe expresses an opinion on someone or something, it's pretty much the opposite of what the Baudelaires (and by extension, the audience) are thinking. Though at times it can be unclear if it's this trope, or he's just trying to put on a brave face.

He should have figured out from the start that The White Witch is evil from what The Pevenisies heard about her from The Beavers or that they found out she imprisoned Tumnus just for helping Lucy. He played the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> even further by sneaking out to the White Witch's castle and getting himself captured. It wasn't until she berated him for coming alone and he was forced to witness her cruelty that he finally snapped out of this trope.

She spends some days at a women's college and at the start reflects that she's never seen such fine specimens of English women. Well, not only do all sorts of not-so-fine things turn up, but the first woman she'd taken an instant liking to turns out to be a murderer. The book ends with Miss Pym reflecting bitterly that "as a psychologist, she was a pretty good teacher of French" and vowing to stop lecturing on psychology.

Quite simply, she has a nasty habit of always assuming the worst of everyone she meets when these people ironically often end up saving her life and or genuinely caring about her. Her trust issues mostly stem from her childhood trauma of never having anyone to be there for her and in turn having to be there for her younger sister.

This leads her to join the villains, as she thinks that Kyousuke would be better off reunited with the Queen. Notably, she even maintains this attitude after the Queen <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>rips off Kyousuke's arm</em> (it was a fake arm, but she didn't know that at the time)</span>.

<ul><li> First, he faints with despair after an adulterous couple explains why they had no choice but to fall into sin. Their excuse? They heard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">a love poem about Lancelot's affair</a> and thought it sounded pretty cool.
</li><li> Second, Dante can't help but feel pity when he meets his former master, Brunetto Latini, punished for some type of violence. Dante thanks him for teaching him everything about writing and poetry and remembers how Latini taught him that the secret to immortality was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker">write brilliantly</a>. Lattini reaffirms everything Dante says of him, even when Dante says he wouldn't have put Lattini in Hell, apparently not realizing that in life and now in death he lead Dante away from the true secret to immortality: giving one's self entirely in the Love that is God. So in perpetuating Dante's error and leading him away from the Paradise, Lattini continues in death to do Violence against God.
</li></ul></li><li> Thomas Aquinas concludes a dialogue about human wisdom by observing that men are foolish when they casually judge whether another is damned or blessed because to do so would be to "count ears before the corn is ripe." Since that's foolish, Aquinas reminds the ordinary man that he should not assume to be the Mind of the Lord, for even one who appears to be a robber can be saved while the charitable giver may suffer in Inferno.

<ul><li> All of Team Free Will struggles with this mightily in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>. In season 4, Sam trusts Ruby, a demon, and she gets him hooked on demon blood and uses him to free Lucifer. In season 6, Castiel and Crowley team up behind the Winchesters' backs, and after a series of double-crosses, they end up unleashing the Leviathan, hyper-intelligent, primordial beings that feed primarily on humans, but will eat <em>any</em> species in a pinch. In season 10, Dean trusts Crowley, the King of Hell, and Cain, the father of murder, and ends up with the Mark of Cain, a supernatural mark that slowly corrupts his soul through violent murder and eventually turns him into a demon. There are many more examples, but this really could be its own page.

After Angel comes in and saves her, Cordelia even acknowledges that she blew it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> In spite of all his other mistakes, Eddard Stark could have succeeded if he had not trusted one particular person despite that person hating him for marrying their childhood crush (and that's not even going into their whole duel with his eldest brother which humiliated them). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldPossiblyGoWrong">What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</a> This comes partially from his wife's equally horrible misjudgment of the same character precisely because he was her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>. But of course, unlike the audience, neither of them were privy to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexposition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexposition">Sexposition</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump">Info Dump</a> on his motivations.
</li><li> Sansa is this at first. This may be a family trait; "I trust her, even though she tells me not to" could almost be the words of House Stark. She completely fails to see the parts of people she doesn't want to see, especially with regard to Joffrey. While the life in the court makes her a bit warier and she becomes disillusioned about Joffrey, it remains to be seen if her trust in Shae, and Tyrion by extension, is a good call. This trait has pretty much vanished by Season 5  such as the way she interacts with Myranda, not fooled for a second by the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">Bitch in Sheep's Clothing</a> act and she is also one of the few people who always seems uncomfortable around Littlefinger and sees the inner good in the Hound. Although she, and Littlefinger apparently, <em>seriously</em> misjudge how crazy Ramsay is and Sansa only sees his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskOfSanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaskOfSanity">Mask of Sanity</a> crack just before the wedding.
</li><li> Catelyn is actually quite astute, warning Robb about crossing the Greyjoys (she turns out to be absolutely right about Theon) and the Freys. But she makes several terrible errors of judgment with dangerous consequences (usually, in her defense, not without some good reasons).
<ul><li> She fails to see Tyrion as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenGoodTeammate">Token Good Teammate</a> of House Lannister at least partially because she completely trusts Littlefinger, which is an even greater mistake.
</li><li> Speaking of Littlefinger (the aforementioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>) she has absolute trust in him, but he is behind pretty much everything bad that happens in the series. She vouches for him before her skeptical husband, leading directly to Ned's capture and execution.
</li><li> Even though she doesn't fully trust Walder Frey, she has absolute faith that Walder Frey would never let any harm come to her. However, breaking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a> is practically unheard of in Westeros so it's not unreasonable that she would never dream that he would stoop that low, though her book counterpart is fully aware of his sneakiness.
</li><li> Also of her sister. Catelyn seemed to trust in her absolutely when she blamed the Lannisters for Jon Arryn's death and believed that Tyrion would receive a fair trial if brought to her. In her defense, she hadn't seen her in quite some time. It's not until they meet again does she realize how crazy her sister has become.
</li></ul></li><li> Notably averted with Arya, despite it being her family's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> early in the series. In contrast to her father, mother and older brother and sister who all trust the wrong people (Ned and Catelyn - Littlefinger, Sansa - Joffrey and Cersei, Robb - Theon and to a lesser extent the Freys) Arya is savvy from the get-go and immediately dislikes the Lannisters, particularly Joffrey. She's also suitably guarded while surviving on her own, the only person she does trust with her identity  Gendry  is one of the rare good people in Westeros and her suspicions of people like Melisandre are quickly justified.
</li><li> Grand Maester Pycelle invokes this trope for any eavesdroppers in "Fire and Blood" when he describes Joffrey as the most promising king he's served. He also did this in the backstory when he advised Aerys II to open the gates for his true master's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryBetrayal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalryBetrayal">Cavalry Betrayal</a>.
</li><li> Cersei, to a fair extent. Like her father, she'll never see anything positive about Tyrion, even if it's dancing in front of her, which often makes her vastly underestimate him, even as she fears him by distorting what he's capable of, as well. She started to wise-up about Joffrey, but had been in denial for years about how unstable he actually was (answer: VERY)  this very denial caused <em>soooooo</em> many problems, it's unreal. And, then there's her tendency to belittle anybody who has faith in anything other than power or gold, which caused her to massively misread the High Sparrow, for one. Listen to her tone when she says she has nothing to fear from him because "he's a religious man". It screams "an idiot I can use because he's religious" in subtext. Rather badly judged, there, Queenie. Almost as bad as deciding that you've managed to cow a tail-tucked Lady Olenna Tyrell...
</li><li> Joffrey appoints his grandfather Tywin to the position of Hand of the King, apparently without realizing that Tywin Lannister is <em>not</em> the sort of man who will put up with Joffrey's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> antics. Joffrey also seems to enjoy Littlefinger, seemingly unaware that Littlefinger is not a man to be enjoyed or remotely trusted (this is a global mistake, in all fairness). He is also, unlike his mother, completely unaware that Margaery is playing him like a fiddle.
</li><li> In the very end, pretty much all the major characters who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">have been working for Daenerys realise that theyve been assuming too much good about her because shes cute, frees slaves (who then become her fanatical followers), and talks a good idealistic speech. Indeed, the trope is heavily played with here, because a lot of <em>the audience</em> made the same mistake, despite her unconcealed messiah complex, vicious vengefulness, and tendency to kill lots of people to make a point  features which, in a non-fantasy story, would have marked her down as potentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> much earlier</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings">Happy Endings</a></em>, this is slightly inverted and played with  Jane states she has pretty solid "bitch-dar" and then quietly remarks to herself "You are not fooling me one-armed surfer girl."
</li><li> Liz Lemon of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> has this in spades. There's her long list of horrible dates and instances of trusting the wrong men. There's the fact she counts Jenna as a friend despite the fact the woman is a hopeless narcissist. There's continuing to fail to realize the depths of Tracy's stupidity and insanity until it causes trouble. And there's her failure to realize that yes, Jack really is that amazingly selfish and shallow sometimes. Most notably, Liz is a horrible judge of her <em>own</em> character. She talked in high school of being the picked-on nerd only to discover she was the horrible bully putting everyone down. For example, she constantly talked to a "friend" about his being gay but he saw this as horrible insults. When she says at the reunion she just wanted to give him the courage to come out, he asks "come out of what?" and introduces his wife. To be fair to Liz he is implied nonetheless to be gay as he introduces that wife "...with whom I've raised three beautiful dogs. ... I'm so mad all I can do is Dance!" So whether the judgment is poor is in question in this case.

<ul><li> Matt Murdock has a shade of this when it comes to Elektra Natchios. Matt nearly ruined his future because of how much of a bad influence Elektra was on him, with her trying to make Matt a killer by presenting him with Roscoe Sweeney, the man who ordered his father's death. Matt broke it off then, and when she returns seeking for Matt to help her and Stick fight the Hand, she proves to be as negative of an influence as before, causing Matt to self-destruct his firm and strain his friendships with Foggy and Karen. Foggy is aware of how Elektra was a negative influence on Matt. As a result, when Matt and Foggy are offered Karen's case in the season 1 premiere, and Matt insists Karen is innocent (because he can read her heartbeat) despite the orgy of evidence against her, Foggy worries that Karen is going to turn out just like Elektra.

</li><li> A misjudgment of character is what gets James Wesley killed. After the whole fiasco with Union Allied, Wesley makes the mistake of thinking that Karen can be silenced by bribery. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribeBackfire">It instead further motivates her into going after Fisk.</a> When Wesley finds out about Karen's visit to Fisk's mother, he drugs her, takes her to a warehouse, and threatens her with a loaded gun that he leaves on a table between them. While he keeps the gun closer to him than to her, he focuses on her friends and family rather than the immediate risk of her killing him. He also makes the mistake of thinking that like everyone else he's ever strong-armed into doing something, she's afraid of Fisk, which she isn't. He's also completely oblivious to the fact she's been drinking so heavily recently, as alcoholics are more resistant to sedatives, and Wesley is relying on Karen's diminished state to protect himself. When Wesley is distracted by the sound of his phone ringing, Karen grabs his gun from the table and points it at him. Despite knowing the gun is loaded, Wesley maintains his poker face because he thinks Karen is a scared little girl who's too afraid to pull the trigger, his research apparently having overlooked that she was taught by her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend how to use a gun, and more importantly, she shot him with it in defense of her brother.

</div><ul><li> The whole reason Karen takes an interest in Frank Castle during the second half of season 2 is that she's trying to convince herself that she was justified in killing Wesley. She believes that deep down, Frank was a good man, albeit heavily troubled and traumatized, despite everyone  Matt, Foggy, even Frank himself  telling her that he legitimately ENJOYS killing people. Her reaction to witnessing Frank using her as bait to lure two of the Blacksmith's men to a diner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinerBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DinerBrawl">so he can brutally kill them</a> is the realization that she's horribly wrong about her assumption that Frank is a person capable of redemption.
</li><li> Leland Owlsley believes that Wilson Fisk's attachment to Vanessa Marianna is clouding his judgment and distracting him, causing him to act illogically. Later, after trying to have Vanessa killed by poisoning, he approaches Fisk trying to blackmail him. Leland's ploy relies on the same questionable judgment; Fisk reacts logically to being blackmailed... Right after Fisk notices his tells and pokes holes in his excuse using logic, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestinationDefenestration">it all ends with Fisk throwing him down an elevator shaft</a>.
</li><li> Nelson &amp; Murdock gets a case of this as a whole in the start of season 2 when they run into Grotto, a low-level Kitchen Irish grunt who just escaped a Punisher attack. Grotto greatly downplays his role and convinces them all that he's little more than a low-level thug who simply does some delivery work. He does it so well in fact, that Matt's lie detector abilities fail him. Matt is appropriately horrified when Frank Castle makes Grotto admit he has murdered under orders from his superiors and killed an old woman when she wouldn't keep quiet.
</li><li> In season 3, Ray Nadeem is a down on his luck FBI agent who is deeply in debt and desperate for a promotion to pay for his sister-in-law's cancer treatments. By luck, he is assigned to make a milk run to Rikers to collect information from Wilson Fisk. Fisk offers Nadeem information on an Albanian syndicate in exchange for Vanessa getting leniency, appealing to Nadeem being a family man who does anything for his loved ones. The information turns out to be reliable, which is all part of Fisk's plan to gain Nadeem's trust. Nadeem has no idea that Fisk is manipulating his trust, and in fact has been doing so for several years, having cut off his family's health insurance years ago to drive him into debt, and make him desperate enough to make the informant deal work that he won't notice obvious red flags that Fisk has malicious intentions. With his credibility established to Nadeem, Fisk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">pays Jasper Evans to shank him</a>, crafting a fiction that he's been branded as a snitch within the prison walls, and convincing Nadeem to vouch for him to be moved to a penthouse suite in the Presidential Hotel. (A coincidental attack on his motorcade by the Albanians, which is foiled by Dex, conveniently furthers the narrative.) By episode 5, Nadeem has enough trust in Fisk that Fisk is able to convince him that Matt was an accomplice of his and that Nelson &amp; Murdock did dirty work for Fisk, and Nadeem doesn't consider how unlikely it would be that Matt, who was part of the firm that took down Fisk in the first place, was secretly working for Fisk this whole time; nor does he consider the possibility that Matt is someone Fisk might have a personal vendetta against. It's only when Matt and Karen track down Jasper Evans, and Evans is subsequently killed by Dex in an attack on the <em>Bulletin</em> on Fisk's orders, that Nadeem starts to realize that Fisk is playing him.
</li><li> Nadeem's efforts to break out from under Fisk's grasp only cause him to make another misjudgment of character. After finding out that the <em>Bulletin</em> attacker is Dex, he breaks into Dex's apartment with Matt to look for evidence. The infiltration goes awry when Dex comes early and shoots at them, and Nadeem is wounded. Nadeem decides to go with OPR Agent Winn to his boss, SAC Tammy Hattley, with his suspicions about Dex. However, he fails to consider the fact that where there's one dirty cop, there's probably more that come with him. Sure enough, Hattley turns out to have been in Fisk's pocket this whole time. She kills Winn with Nadeem's gun, and then Felix Manning turns up to threaten Nadeem into doing dirty work for Fisk under the threat of being framed for Winn's murder. Nadeem thus finds himself having to spend a day doing grunt work with Dex, rounding up other criminals Fisk is extorting protection money from, and then serving as Dex's getaway driver when Dex is dispatched by Fisk to kill Karen to avenge the death of James Wesley.

Seriously, her husband Hephaestus may not have been a prize catch, but falling for Ares, the homicidal god of war? The fact that she was likely the <em>only</em> one who even <em>liked</em> him should have tipped her off that he was bad news. She <em>really</em> could have done better.

</li><li> Another example would be most of the city of Troy; it was pretty obvious that the Trojan Horse was a trap. In fact, some residents of the city were <em>not</em> fooled. Possibly the dissenter who could have had the best chance of making them reconsider was the Trojan priest Laocoön (the phrase, "I fear Greeks, even those bringing gifts" can be attributed to him), but after he and his sons were attacked and strangled by serpents, the Trojans paid his warning no heed. (Depending on the version, the serpents were sent either by Poseidon or Apollo, who both held grudges against Laocoön.) Helen also guessed the plot and tried to expose it by mimicking the voices of the wives of some Greeks she suspected were inside the device to convince them to come out. (And Anticlus almost fell for it; the plan would have failed if Odysseus had not covered his mouth with his hand.) King Priam's daughter Cassandra, the soothsayer of Troy (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">Cassandra Truth</a>) predicted the Horse would be the doom of the city and its royal family.

<ul><li> Arguably, The Emperor of Mankind has this problem.
<ul><li> Despite numerous warnings from various sources, he still failed to see Horus' betrayal coming. I guess you don't expect that sort of thing from your favourite genetically engineered son...
</li><li> Theres also his trust in some of his other sons who turned to chaos and all the Chaos Space Marines who were, putting it lightly, horrible, horrible people.
</li><li> The one son he did decide not to trust, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCassandra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCassandra">Magnus the Red</a>, was the one who tried to warn him about Horus, and who was pushed to Chaos as a result.
</li></ul></li><li> The Horus Heresy was mostly caused by the Primarchs being miserable judges of character. The loyal Primarchs refused to believe their brothers would betray the Emperor, allowing them to be blindsided. The Traitor Primarchs that started the Heresy believed the Emperor was a power-hungry jerk who was betraying them. In reality, while the Emperor was undoubtedly a jerk, his goal was ultimately pure — a golden age for Mankind, not the God-Emperor of Mankind.

</li><li> A downplayed example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em>, Othello is mindlessly trusting of his ancient, "honest Iago," a character thoroughly devoted to ruining his life. This is more due to Iago being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Manipulative Bastard</a> than Othello being a Horrible Judge Of Character. It still doesn't excuse some of Othello's idiocy, such as saying he refuses to believe Iago's words about Desdemona's infidelity and then, two seconds later, believing what Iago says. Othello also refuses to believe people who <em>are</em> honest with him, such as Desdemona and Emelia.
</li><li> This was also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/KingLear">King Lear</a></em>'s problem when he was unable to distinguish between the genuine love his daughter Cordelia had for him and the shallow flattery offered by her wicked sisters.

And if the Dragonborn offers to follow the Greybeards' pacifistic, non-violent philosophy, Arngeir will gently rebuke them, pointing out that they have their power for a different reason than the Greybeards do.

And THIS is despite that they were on friendly terms. He also thinks that Motonari and Mitsunari are on good terms with each other, which leads to his surprise reaction to Mitsunari's death by Motonari's hand.

He also only learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the mayor</span> is a villain by walking in on a conversation while going to ask him for help. Meanwhile, he is instantly suspicious of two figures who turn out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chaud and Protoman, his longtime allies throughout the entire series</span>, nor does he connect the two even after the first reveals himself.

In the <em>Revelation</em> route, he's the very last of the Avatar's siblings to come around, as he's thoroughly convinced that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Garon</a> isn't evil. Also justified, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Garon was in all respects a model parent for Xander before the in-fighting and assassination occurred as a consequence of Garon's womanizing ways, and is fighting the war because he believes that Garon will return to who he was if they manage to conquer Hoshido, and is, like most Nohrians, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">Locked Out of the Loop</a> in terms of Garon's passing and return as a corpse-familiar of Anankos. He will only go directly against "Garon" if he gets undeniable proof that the real Garon's gone: In the <em>Conquest</em> route, it happens in the second to last level, when he sees "Garon" as a slime monster, and on the <em>Revelation</em> route, he, alongside Leo, defects to the Avatar's side when they visit Corpse-Garon, who says to them that he wants to destroy not only Hoshido but also Nohr, something that would be unthinkable for Garon in his pre-corpse-familar life</span>.
<ul><li> It's also partly reflected in regards to his retainers. Despite his faith and confidence in Laslow, he seemed initially unaware of the latter's womanizing ways (or at least if the way he reacted in their C Support is any indicator). And with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho">Peri</a>, he picked her purely because of her immense potential to excel in fighting and seems to ignore her bloodthirsty nature and casual murdering of her own servants (though as the Prince and her boss, he might have learned about her past and feel sympathy for her). Even with Charlotte, it was less that he could see through her act and more that he seemed to honestly believe her a complete flirt.
</li><li> However, he easily can tell that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> Hans is someone not to trust, is unsurprised by Iago's acts of cruelty, could tell Kaze in their supports had gained a stronger conviction by looking at him and, like the other siblings, was rightfully put off by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zola disguised as Izana in <em>Conquest</em> - although it turned out the real Izana was just as flamboyant.</span> Therefore, it could be argued that in the case of Garon, Xander is more blinded by family obligation and loyalty rather than being unable to tell his father is a monster.

He's such a bad judge of character that, even though he's been fully aware for <em>years</em> that Dr. Eggman doesn't say anything that won't get him closer to the Chaos Emeralds and world domination, he still takes everything the corpulent madman says at face value and follows up on things Eggman says better than things that people he <em>trusts with his own life</em> tell him. The other characters have been riding him about it for years; if he does something even subjectively stupid, the knee-jerk assumption is that he's been talking to Eggman again. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic The Hedgehog 3</a></em> was the only time Knuckles completely believed him since it was their first meeting. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure">Sonic Adventure</a></em> Eggman only makes Knuckles confused and suspicious about Sonic's actions (and considering the Master Emerald was destroyed, Knuckles probably wasn't in the best frame of mind at the time). In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvanceTrilogy">Sonic Advance 2</a></em>, Knuckles ends up being tricked somehow by Eggman into fighting Sonic with the Egg Saucer, which, after Sonic destroys it, Knuckles chased him covered in soot. The cutscene afterwards reveals that he was tricked by Eggman once again, with Knuckles being upset at this revelation, and Sonic deciding to leave him to sulk until Knuckles decides to get his act together.

Like Knuckles, she's basically a good character working for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> because she assumes that the villain has good intentions. Unlike Knuckles, she still believes her employer is trustworthy in spite of how The Sorceress <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">bullies and browbeats her at every turn</a>, and repeatedly sacrifices her hapless, unwilling minions to create mutant abominations to send after the heroes. Bianca only figures out she's on the wrong side once The Sorceress reveals her plan to kill the baby dragons they've been kidnapping, and she pulls a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> immediately afterward.
</li><li> <em>The Urbz: Sims in the City</em> has a minor character, Lily Gates, who apparently means well but is a terrible judge of character.

In her eyes, Reyes fights for the people and loves her just as she loves him. In the eyes of John Marston and the player, however, Reyes is an egomaniac with a talent for getting peasants to listen to him whose only concern is personal glory and can barely remember Luisa's name. Similarly, Luisa has problems seeing that John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotInThisForYourRevolution">cares nothing for the fate of Mexico</a> and helps her and the rebels only because he's got a soft spot for her and that they're a means to an end.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SquirrelBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SquirrelBoy">Squirrel Boy</a></em> episode "Islands in the Street", when Andy teams up with the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> Kyle to find Rodney and Salty Mike, Bob sees Kyle criticize his car's cup holder before throwing it out in disgust and declares "He seems nice."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsResistance">Star Wars Resistance</a></em>: Tam Ryvora believes that, because her grandfather once worked in an Imperial factory, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviouslyEvil">Obviously Evil</a> First Order isn't really a problem and can be reasoned with. She learns the hard way that blowing off Kaz and Yeager's warnings about them was a <em>bad</em> idea.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> Padmé's Separatist friend Senator Bonteri of Onderon served Count Dooku due to believing that the Republic was too corrupt to be effective and that Dooku was a good man, despite Padmé's warnings otherwise. Her naivety ends up getting her killed, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">Dooku ends up having her assassinated</a> due to her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">attempts at ending the war</a> obstructing the Sith plan to use it to wipe out the Jedi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StaticShock">Static Shock</a></em>: In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VerySpecialEpisode">Jimmy</a>," the entire school is this to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">Nick Connor</a>, having voted him "Best Personality". Virgil himself notes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">there should have been a recount</a>, and he's proven right when Nick relentlessly bullies and torments the titular character Jimmy Osgood to the point he snaps and steals his father's gun with full intent of killing him, which he's barely talked down from doing. By the end of the episode, everyone has been made aware of Nick's true colors, with Virgil remarking that the only good thing about the whole mess is that at least he won't be winning any more popularity contests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> had its fair share of examples. Arguably the worst case happens in "Megatron's Master Plan", which revolves around the Decepticons' plan to make the people of Earth (or at least Central City) believe that they were, in fact, the good guys all along... after how many very obvious instances they are not? And everybody actually believed it! Then when they were proven complete morons, the enslaved humans all blamed Shawn Berger, who while not having a great reason to help the Decepticons at least had the most reason to trust them, as the second main cause of their misery.
<ul><li> "Enter the Nightbird" might be another case, depending on how much sentience/sapience one reads in the titular character. Giant robot ninja armed with more weapons and powers than you can shake a stick at? Truly she is going to "benefit mankind, and not harm it".
</li><li> Orion Pax was one of these in his backstory. He was a <em>Megatron fanboy</em> who thought old Megs had Cybertron's best interests at heart. That ended when Megatron nearly killed him and his girlfriend after duping them into helping him. Orion's a somewhat better judge of character as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a> Optimus Prime.
</li><li> Megatron insists on keeping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">the original Starscream</a> around, despite the endless plotting to overthrow him - most of it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">clearly audible from a long way off</a>, and some of it <em>to his face</em>. Lampshaded in the Generation 2 comics:
<div class="indent"><strong>Megatron:</strong> <em>Why?</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereYouThinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereYouThinking">That's what they all asked me.</a> Why <em>him</em>...why <em>Starscream</em>? Why, of all the Decepticons, did I choose to revitalise the one whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">record of deceit and betrayal</a> is <em>legend</em>? Because I'm an <em>idiot</em>, that's why!
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>:
<ul><li> When talking about the Elite Guard the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWikiDotNet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TFWikiDotNet">Transformers Wiki</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Autoboot_Camp">noted that:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "Sentinel Prime, the biggest jerk in Transformer history, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Longarm Prime, a double-agent</span>, are both high-ranking members of the Elite Guard, while Optimus Prime, a true hero, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmightyJanitor">is a washout and space bridge repairbot</a>. Either Optimus Prime did one major screw-up, or Ultra Magnus is the single worst judge of character ever." Since Optimus Prime's screwup was taking the blame for Elita's death on a planet they shouldn't have been on in the first place, Magnus does have a tiny bit of leeway. No excuse for making Sentinel Prime practically his right-hand-mech, though. Apparently, once washed out, you can't be brought back in, at least according to Magnus himself when talking to Optimus. And he probably keeps Sentinel Prime at his right hand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">so he can babysit him</a>. We've all seen what happens when he's not around to keep the glitch-head out of trouble.
</li><li> Megatron doesn't get off scot-free. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">Starscream</a> was a high-ranking member of the Decepticon forces for eons, and has been trying to off Megatron for a good deal of them. But Megatron seemed genuinely surprised when he found out it was Starscream who planted the bomb on him. He learned his lesson after that, showing that, unlike most other Megatrons, he's not at all forgiving. Starscream shows up, and once he has his gun back, the first thing ol' Megs does is blast Starscream square in the face. He proceeds to wash, rinse, and repeat as necessary whenever the guy shows his face.
