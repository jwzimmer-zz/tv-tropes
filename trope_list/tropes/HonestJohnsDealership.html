They're called "gray market salesmen" in business/econ terms. Ironically enough, they have less of a reason to lie and cheat than new car salesmen, as used car sales are a) more profitable in general and b) usually grant more consistent commissions because you're largely just selling the car and have fewer middle-men to appease, while new car salesmen derive a far larger portion of their commissions from tacked-on extras, leading to overwhelmingly high-pressure tactics and occasionally outright lying or <em>grossly</em> stretching the truth.

<ul><li> Sarcastically praised in Bud Light's "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGY8wUEmws0">Real men of genius: Mr. Used Car Lot Auto Salesman<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" in which the titular used car salesman's dodgy sales techniques are discussed and the announcer deadpans "...because when life gives <em>you</em> lemons, you <em>sell</em> them."
</li><li> Parodied and inverted in a couple of Whittaker's Peanut Slab adverts, including <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeSGEYyFqGU&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLD9EBBDD84BB18077">this one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Then there was Joe Isuzu, fictional spokesman for Isuzu cars and trucks in the late 80s and early 90s (and again briefly in the early 2000s), as played by David Leisure from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmptyNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmptyNest">Empty Nest</a></em>. He would frequently make outrageous claims about the car he was pitching (which would then be immediately contradicted by captions at the bottom of the screen). However, iconic as they were, it also caused a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereTheySellingAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatWereTheySellingAgain">What Were They Selling Again?</a>. When Joe made his brief 2000s return, he was more about selling and/or pointing out the Isuzu, rather than making weird claims.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em>: The <strong>N</strong>ight<strong>M</strong>are <strong>E</strong>nterprises/Holy Nightmare salesman. Dedede gave him nearly 100 episodes worth of payback when they finally meet personally. In the 4kids dub, he's like an American car salesman, while the original version is based on a polite and humble Japanese salesman — but the roles are just about the same.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>: Nabiki Tendō. In one episode she becomes Ranma's "financée", rents him out to her classmates, tries to get Ranma to break up with her and pay a "consolation fee", then tries to sell him back to Akane for anywhere from (what's equivalent to) $19 to $50. As she said in another episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Akane:</strong> Whose side are you on? <br/><strong>Nabiki:</strong> I'm on the side with money.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em>, Rabat (or as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said, a contraction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Rat Bastard</a>) is a Honest John. Only later we learn his true purposes, but until then, he sells everything from weaponry to cosmetics to ship drive boosters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Area88">Area 88</a></em>: The base quartermaster McCoy is a prime example of this, stocking everything from toilet paper to nuclear weapons. He is not above tricks like placing a photographer's bag in the sun to force him to buy new film or selling faulty Sidewinder missiles at $20 each.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>: Lina Inverse.
<ul><li> In the very first episode, she actually haggles over how much she can get paid to save the town she's in from an attacking dragon, stating to her companion that "Necessity drives a hard bargain". A couple of episodes later, she sets prices for several items in her possession at 100 times the street price and accuses the would-be buyer of having no balls for balking when he explicitly stated that he'd pay <em>any</em> price she named. Even her normally easy-going traveling companion is floored by that one.
</li><li> The same exchange occurs in the original light novel; Lina justifies herself to Gourry, saying that the extreme paranoia with which the buyer conducted himself (refusing to even specify which item he wanted to purchase until he was actually handing her the money) piqued her curiosity, so she deliberately named outrageous prices so that the buyer would buzz off long enough that she could have a closer look to find out what was so damn important about three valuable, but otherwise unremarkable, tchotchkes. Not that she would have complained if the buyer had actually ponied up...
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>: The Magikarp Salesman from the show's early seasons routinely tricks Team Rocket into buying useless things. A notable example is in James' first meeting with him, where he tricks James into buying a Magikarp by making him think that it's essentially a Hand of Midas. James seems to wise up and is suspicious in later encounters with him, although Jessie's a different story.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Vamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Vamp">Vamp</a></em>, there is a team of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireHunter">vampire hunters</a> known as Otherworld Welfare Inc., Branch 666, that has a website that sells garlic spray, stake kits, and talismans, in addition to exterminating vampires themselves. They admit that this is done purely for money and that their wares aren't necessarily effective in fighting vampires.

<ul><li> Tom Nook has almost complete control over your town's economy, forcing you to buy a house, and then upgrade it several times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">without really giving you a choice</a>. His two nephews work for him when his store is fully upgraded, so he's also into child labor. He even manages to get control over the hair industry, having a salon in his store. And it's kinda creepy how he stalks you when you run around his store because he wants to be sure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KleptomaniacHero">you don't steal anything</a>. It should be noted that all this gets slowly downplayed throughout the series, though — the salon splits off by <em>City Folk</em>, and in <em>New Leaf</em> he's moved exclusively into the housing industry, and this time he actually gives you a choice as to whether or not you want to expand your house. Plus, even the old shop, now run by Timmy and Tommy, isn't nearly as economy-dominating since the selling function was moved to a separate shop, Re-Tail. This is dropped in <em>New Horizons</em>, but the itinerant vendors who drop by once a week still give good alternatives for selling your stuff.
</li><li> Crazy Redd is a competitor of Nook's who specializes in selling furniture that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FellOffTheBackOfATruck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FellOffTheBackOfATruck">Fell Off the Back of a Truck</a> and counterfeit paintings — a built-in mechanic in his transactions requires you to work out whether the painting he's selling you is the genuine article or a worthless fake.

In Season Two, he's too preoccupied with his conspiracy theories to sell Sam and Max any goodies. He lampshades his role as an Honest John at the end of the first season: when Sam and Max complain that Bosco's newest invention has a price tag of one hundred billion dollars, he points out that he keeps coming up with ridiculous prices, and yet Sam and Max <em>always</em> get the money he's asking for: he has a captive market of an anthropomorphic dog and a rabbit-cat-thing, so why not get all the money he can?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII">Star Control II</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Melnorme Traveller-Traders act a lot like this, selling the player a variety of useful goodies as the end of (nearly) all sentient life steadily approaches. That said, without the information and technology they provide, the game is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfImposedChallenge">substantially harder</a>. They also aren't exactly in it for the profit, their culture just considers it unethical to give without receiving (and that goes both ways. If you have something for them, even if you are willing to give it for free, they <em>will</em> find something to give to you in return).
</li><li> The Druuge as well: they consider profit to be of utmost importance, therefore they will do <em>anything</em> they think they can get away with if it will net them a profit. Trading with them can yield some useful items, but one must be very careful in how one does it. (They don't have a problem with slavery, or using said slaves as <em>reactor fuel</em>.) Also, unlike the Melnorme, who are generally quite honest about their merchandise, the Druuge are quite comfortable selling the player useless baubles and hyping them as powerful artifacts. Happily, the game does give you a chance to solidly screw over one of the Druuge captains on a deal, and it's quite satisfying if you manage it.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Startopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Startopia">Startopia</a></em>: Arona Daal is the absolute epitome of this trope. He'll be selling you <em>anything</em> you're looking for, all top quality; swear on all six of his grandmothers' graves. And at those prices, too; he's slitting both his throats.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, Wakka calls out Rin on the fact that, if they fail to defeat the upcoming Boss, everyone would be in trouble. However, Rin calmly affirms his confidence in their abilities and charges them for his goods anyway. Which is actually kind of funny, noting that said boss is usually considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a>.
</li><li> Several in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Ribald Barterman in <em>Shadows of Amn</em>, proprietor of the "Adventurer's Mart", has the lingo, but most of the stuff he sells is actually good.
</li><li> There is however a merchant in the first game who sells potions who is this trope to a tee. (each potion will increase one of your stats to 25... And lower all the others to 3)
</li><li> Another flamboyant merchant whom you can encounter in the wilderness between Beregost and Nashkel will offer you one of three items for a much lower price than they are actually worth. All three of them are cursed.
</li><li> A halfling near the Ulcaster Ruins tries to sell a "Gem of Seeing" for 1,000 gold that turns out to be a nearly worthless non-magical zircon.
</li><li> Baldur's Gate proper has <em>Lucky Aelo's Discount Store</em>. Every single item for sale there is cursed, including the cool-looking leather armor.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>: Murgo is a classic example. He sells you several cursed quest items, and while he offers a variety of clothing, makeup &amp; hairstyle cards, and other items, most of them are merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourRewardIsClothes">aesthetic in purpose</a>. The real invoking of this trope comes from his spiel about items he's selling in the "childhood" portion of the game as well as the things he'll hawk when you're standing near his kiosk as an adult. He actually does have some real magical items, but only sells them to serious customers (read, those who can defend themselves against the monsters in the places that said items teleport them to.)

His goods are guaranteed the best in town or you no getta your money back. However, he does sell two useful items: the map and compass. In the AGD Remake, he also sells a souvenir snow-globe. Of a desert city.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>: Gheed, one of the two merchants in Act I, is one of these. He offers you a lifetime guarantee and a two-day warranty on all items (presumably on the basis that he doesn't expect you to last any longer as a hero in a world swarming with monsters). He doesn't, of course, in gameplay terms, charge any more than any other merchants. He probably also qualifies as A Friend in the Black Market, as Warriv intimates that Gheed's goods are of high quality.

Or at least you CAN, since the price you can get for an item isn't just the item itself but the customer you are selling it to (the well-dressed man will pay more than the little girl) as well as your relationship with them (if you've given them "good deals" in the past, you can trade on that friendship to charge them more later). Not to mention taking advantage of the daily price fluctuations certain items are in/out of demand) when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneRememberPogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneRememberPogs">a horde of shoppers enter the store, desperate for certain items</a>. Not quite — everything you sell is in working order, but you charge through the nose for it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan">Euria</a> is a better example, selling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">rare, wondrous</a> items and accepting a wider spread of prices for them... with that spread centered at <em>500%</em> market value.

</li><li> Another DLC case, "A Slip of the Tongue" has one questioned in his relations to distributing stolen cars as legitimate ones.

All of the costumes you buy are explained as an advertising contract where you have to buy the uniform yourself, leading to a humiliating cutscene trying to advertise the shop. The outfits themselves seem to be subpar, such as the Knight Armour being made of flimsy materials or the kung-fu suit smelling pretty strongly of BO. However, the rest of his goods, such as extra lives and the Skull Detector are all perfectly fine, and to be fair, some of the jobs Conseil sends you on for the Extra modes are legitimate.

So he's stealing your money <em>twice</em>. He was at one point very honest about his bad deals.

They're charming, fast-talking, and will sell anything for a quick bit, including "health tonic" that may or may not simply be apple juice and beet leaves. Subverted with the Cider Squeezy 6000, which actually was a legitimate, working machine.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Little Dipper", it turns out that selling used cars is what Gideon's dad Bud Gleeful does for a living. "Engine possum at no extra charge!"
</li><li> Grunkle Stan can be considered an example of this trope as well. Generally, his merchandise isn't much worse than your standard gift shop fair, but his attractions are fraudulent. You could also sum up his entire adult life as shown in "Not What He Seems" as: "settle, scam, flee angry mob, repeat".

<ul><li> Played with in "The Accidental Terrorist", Tom Hammond's car dealership actually seems very genuine; selling perfectly good cars, employing certified mechanics and salesmen, and Tom himself looking like a regular clean-cut businessman in a proper suit. However, he has fooled Hank into buying five cars from him at sticker price.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tom:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoAboveItAll">What can I say, Hank?

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder21" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> There's a reason that the trope is named for car dealerships instead of some generic store: the automotive sales industry is so rife with dishonesty, corruption, and trickery that it's hard to visit a car lot without getting the distinct impression that the sales reps are mentally picturing bending you over the nearest table. It's the very reason that lemon laws exist, and there are very few other sales sectors that recommend bringing someone knowledgeable along to make sure you aren't actually <em>being</em> bent over the nearest table.
<ul><li> One other such sector being computer hardware, thanks to GeekSquad, among others.
</li><li> There also (back in the day) was the repair of TVs and VCRs among other such electronics and (still to today) repair of kitchen or laundry appliances.
</li></ul></li><li> In the city of Geneva, Illinois, there are two stores that actually have "Honest John's" in the title. Honest John's Emporium, and Honest John's trading post. They're not really rip-offs, just filled with a lot of cheap useless crap you'll never need but will have a compulsion to buy.
</li><li> Honest Jon's records in London, England - a legitimate and well-regarded record store.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.honestjohn.co.uk/">honestjohn.co.uk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - a website run by a <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DailyTelegraph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DailyTelegraph">Daily Telegraph</a></em> motoring writer who's answered around <em>half a million</em> letters and emails about all kinds of motoring issues with thousands of car reviews and a thriving community offering legal, technical and general advice.
</li><li> Notably averted in the case of Honest Ed's, a long-lasting department store in Toronto known for its very reasonable prices. They even gave out free turkeys every year at (Canadian) Thanksgiving. Unfortunately, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">lack of sales</a> has driven them to close down in 2016.
</li><li> In Britain during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharpDressedMan">sharply-dressed men</a> knowns as "spivs" sold black market goods to people who were unable to get them otherwise due to rationing. They fit this trope almost to a "T".
</li><li> The wedding industry. Many times, couples are charged 2 or 3 times for a 3-tier wedding cake as they would be for a 3-tier birthday cake, or for wedding and engagement rings vs. other types of rings. Wedding planners, venue owners, caterers, bands and DJs, bridal magazines, photographers, jewelers, bridal salons, etc. all push the idea that it's justified because "you only do this once," and "don't you want to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessForADay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessForADay">Princess for a Day</a>?" They also play on the idea that if you spend more, it shows your partner that you love them more, or will go to any length to make them happy...and also on the idea that you should try to one-up all your friends' and siblings' weddings. Even if it means starting a marriage tens of thousands of dollars in debt for a party.
<ul><li> The funeral industry does the same thing. They have been known to prey on the emotions of grieving family members, encouraging/guilt-tripping them to buy expensive caskets (when a simpler one, or cremation, or "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_burial">natural burial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" would do just fine), or having the body embalmed (when refrigerating it would be sufficient to keep it in decent shape for an open-casket funeral.)
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oocyte_cryopreservation">egg-freezing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> industry. Egg-freezing originally started as a way for women who would be undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy during their fertile years, and who still wanted to have kids (or have more kids) later to preserve their eggs before treatment (that would destroy their eggs otherwise), or for women who were undergoing IVF but weren't so keen on the idea of creating "extra" embryos or freezing embryos indefinitely, or women who have a family history of early menopause. That's all well and good, it was soon marketed towards women in their 20s and 30s (perhaps those who wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyVersusCareer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyVersusCareer">focus on their careers</a>), who <em>weren't</em> gearing up for IVF or chemo. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToConsequences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToConsequences">marketing</a> was based on the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBiologicalClockIsTicking">fertility declines sharply after age 35</a>, so it's best to extract and freeze the eggs now and thaw them out later when the woman is ready to "settle down" and start a family. What they <em>don't</em> tell their prospective clients, however, is that an embryo made from these frozen eggs has a <em>less than 50%</em> chance of resulting in a successful pregnancy...and that healthy pregnancies in older women are <em>a lot</em> more common than many people think, meaning that a) there's a good chance a client might get pregnant the old-fashioned way later than she ever thought possible (or simply change her mind), and b) in many cases, freezing your eggs in your 20's or 30's is <em>completely unnecessary in the first place</em>. Oh, yeah, and the process of obtaining the eggs involves taking hormones and other drugs that can have side-effects, and the actual procedure is invasive...and that it's an expensive procedure that is <em>almost never</em> covered by even top-notch medical insurance in the US (and may not be covered by the government elsewhere). (And that's <em>not</em> including the cost of the IVF procedure if and when their owner <em>does</em> decide to use them...which is also almost never covered.)
</li><li> These people show up online as well, which is why you should be very careful on online auction sites and with third-party sellers on Amazon.
</li><li> The SSL industry (the people who make HTTPS work) has used the brand name <em>Honest Achmed's Used Cars and Certificates</em> as a stand-in for an actor who'd do anything for some cash <a class="urllink" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=647959">since 2011<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. (Although his uncles are good for credit.)
