</p><p>The heroic converse of this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster">To Be a Master</a>, where the hero is motivated by ambition.

</li><li> Subverted for Katsuki Bakugo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>. His ambition to be the number one hero is actually treated as one of his few positive points, despite him being a huge jerk about it. He also refuses to go down the path of a villain, despite the fact that his Quirk would be very suited for it. That said, in Chapter 120, All Might says that his drive to be the best is holding him back from being a hero and that he needs to work on also having an equal drive for rescuing people.

Most of the villains have pretty lofty goals, but the main characters have arguably the highest ambitions in the series. Inverted with Captain Kuro, who annoys Luffy because his goal to retire from being a pirate is completely lame.
<ul><li> Played straight with Blackbeard, whose ambition to become Pirate King led him to kill one of his own crewmates in the back story, capture Ace to secure a position in the Seven Warlords of the Sea, try and kill Luffy, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> caused a war that led to the death of Ace, Oars Jr., and who knows how many others, killing Whitebeard directly and unleashed who knows how many of the world's worst criminals on an unsuspecting world</span>.
</li><li> Basically <em>One Piece</em> is more like "Ambition is Neutral," as many of the villains they have fought had aims similar to the heroes, and it was merely their methods that were evil, not necessarily their aims. Blackbeard above is the best example as he also wants to be King of the Pirates, but his methods involve all sorts of cruelty. Or Eneru, whose ambition was to go to the Moon, perfectly innocuous except that he wanted to do it by plundering an island of all its gold then planning to blow the island up into the sea.
<ul><li> It should be noted that said blowing up wasn't even <em>necessary</em> to the plan. It was just for the sake of it.
</li></ul></li><li> Hell, "Haki" (Japanese for "ambition") is basically <em>One Piece</em>'s resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a>.

He promises to tell Slade where the group, known as Demon Card, has its headquarters so long as Slade only arrests King. Slade agrees, then brings the whole army and shoots everyone down in as flashy a way as possible so his superiors will notice and he'll get a promotion. In doing so, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">pushed King all the way into</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">status</a>, and set his <em>six year old son</em> down the road to that as well.

</li><li> Kuki Urie's ambitions might be fueled by an understandable desire to avenge his father, but the methods he uses establish him firmly as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Token Evil Teammate</a> of the Quinx Squad.

His worst excesses (such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a> and the Armor Wars) are usually not driven by lust for power, but by an overzealous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">sense of guilt and responsibility</a>.
</li><li> Half the point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a></em> was that, where other superheroes simply react to supervillains' schemes and preserve the status quo, The Authority would use their powers to genuinely change the world.

It's revealed in flashbacks that he has a strong desire for love and adoration. Since his ambitions were very altruistic, and he used his superpowers to make them come true by helping people, nobody seemed to mind (or just assumed he was doing it out of the goodness of his heart and not a need for affection). But then he eventually realized you can't please everyone and gave up on being a hero, and instead ruined a world that he could never get to love him.

They even announced that if people trusted them they would give up control over Earth in exactly one year. However this was seen as a bad thing by half the heroes, who organized a resistance against them. The reasons given weren't very convincing- they just seemed to be there just to maintain the Status Quo of their Earth resembling the real one.

<ul><li> The title character in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl">Artemis Fowl</a></em> series is motivated almost entirely by monetary gain in the first book, but as he makes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">transition</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> to a more conventional protagonist over the course of the series.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSteinbeck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnSteinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>'s <em>Winter of Our Discontent</em> has a main character from a formerly wealthy family who goes to extreme lengths to reclaim his former wealth and status.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> this is used to foreshadow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRangerTraitor">Sixth Ranger Traitor</a> David's turn to the dark side.
</li><li> The "darkest" of the four houses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, Slytherin, has ambition and cunning as its main valued qualities. Although being in Slytherin does not guarantee you'll become evil, (Merlin studied there, for instance, and Slughorn was an okay guy,) the house gets a terrible rap because most, if not all, wizards who did turn to evil have studied there - so while a predominantly cunning and ambitious mind is not a guarantee of villainy, it is a prerequisite for it.
<ul><li> In Chapter 17 of Sorcerer's Stone, we get a character's ambition mentioned <em>in the same breath</em> as his hatred and greed.
</li><li> Also, Percy's ambition and devotion to the Ministry (despite being a Gryffindor) set him at odds with the rest of his family.
</li><li> As revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>,</em> this could be how Dumbledore viewed himself. In his youth, he worked with another wizard to find artifacts of great power, ostensibly to help his family but as much for himself. It took a tragedy to bring him back to earth, and ever since he kept himself away from positions of power such as Minister for Magic.
</li><li> By the end of the series it becomes clear, through secondary characters, that good and evil exist in all houses. It's just that ambition is a trait that can lead to villainy if not properly handled and limited, which explains why many shady individuals hail from Slytherin. Also visionary criminals are more likely to become famous rather than petty and insignificant ones.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted several times in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a></em> novels. The titular character herself spends much of the first book being ambitious about future rank. <em>Storm from the Shadows</em> plays it straight in regards to most Solarian League Naval personnel, with Battle Fleet having centuries of naval service in each family with characters with ambition to be like their last 10 forefathers and be important Battle fleet Admirals. Because of their ambition and pride, they also get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> and see nothing wrong with having had no major battles in 300 years nor a tiny R&amp;D budget with no major upgrades in the last century.
<ul><li> Several other major characters also resent this trope. Honor fights several times what she feels is favorable treatment to suit her ambition. Her rank is usually thrust upon her after arguing she not only deserves it, but is obligated to take it to better serve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>.
</li><li> Luis Roszak is sort of a borderline case; he's generally presented as a positive character, but it's clear that he can be absolutely ruthless in the service of his ambition.
</li><li> Turns out the Solarian League assumes everyone else has their same ambitions, but just isn't capable because they aren't the Solarian League. This leads to rather poor military intelligence estimates, and once reality hits that people are capable of hurting them, their assumption of ambition means they are going to have to do horrible things to put people in their place...
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in Robert Asprin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MythAdventures">Myth Adventures</a></em>. The characters frequently use their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a> to make money and usually each book ends with them even richer than when they started.
<ul><li> In <em>Class Dis-mythed</em>, a secondary character directly argues (in an impromptu lecture) that the most effective way to help others is to focus first on one's own personal security and financial success. While overlooking the obvious rebuttals, this isn't presented as a strawman argument, and quite possibly represents the author's current views. The important thing to remember is that it says "focus <em>first</em> on your own personal security and financial success", not "focus <em>only</em> on". A lot of villains forget that part.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> takes great care to mention "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Tigerstar's</a> ambition" everywhere it can. Every villain so far has been ambitious (except <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ashfur</span>).

</li><li> Oh so very many villains, and characters who may not be overtly villainous but certainly do a lot for Horus' cause, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a></em> novels are guided by ambition in one form or another; these range from the vox officer on the <em>Eisenstein</em> (who wants to command his own ship one day and betrays them to Typhon), to Horus himself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, Elaida isn't outright evil in the first place (though definitely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">not nice</a>), but her ambition (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and a bit of help from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWitch">Black Ajah</a></span>) cause her to screw up everything and go well inside evil territory to keep her power. Also, ambition is the reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sheriam, and possibly many others, joined the Black Ajah</span>.
</li><li> This is a recurring theme in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a>'s mystery novels. One of her favorite types of villain (and/or victim) was a character from humble origins who had clawed his or her way to the top.

He became, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrooge">The Scrooge</a> after allowing himself to be consumed with ambition and greed. At one point his younger self even lampshades the trope, and what he sees as its unfairness:
<div class="indent">"This is the even-handed dealing of the world. There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth!"
</div></li><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P. G.

Later, it's his aunt Agatha who is always pressuring Bertie to get a job. Lord Emsworth has similar problems with his sister Constance.
<ul><li> Also a partial subversion. Bertram Wooster (and his lack of ambition) isn't set up as a real role model. Really, mostly ambition is evil only when someone is trying to make Wooster evil. However, many of his friends have ambition.
</li></ul></li><li> The major recurring theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePillarsOfTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePillarsOfTheEarth">The Pillars of the Earth</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWithoutEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWithoutEnd">World Without End</a></em> is that people will put their own ambitions over what is morally right and what is best for everyone. All of the villains are consumed by the desire to rise above their current station and will do horrible things in the attempt. Further, the morally ambililent characters will repeatedly make decisions based solely on what is best for their advancement. Even the heroes are sometimes accused of being too arrogant or ambitious, though unlike others they do so in the pursuit of more noble goals.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Played with</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. Ambition itself is not evil, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">One Ring</a> will inevitably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">twist any ambition or aspiration into an evil parody of its original form</a>.
<ul><li> Well, it <em>tries</em> to. When The Ring tries to corrupt Samwise by exploiting his desire to be a gardener it shows him that he could turn all of Middle Earth into a garden for him to tend. Sam shrugs it off by noting he'd need an army of gardeners to handle that much work, and what would be the point of gardening if you didn't do it yourself?
</li><li> Indeed, this is why the One Ring is kept in the hands of hobbits. A ruler like Aragorn or Galadriel might have the ambition of restoring their kingdom into an immortal empire, and a wizard like Gandalf or Saruman might have the ambition of vanquishing evil across the world, desires that are so amazing in scale, so tempting, and so altruistic at first glance that they're hard to turn down and easy to corrupt. On the other hand, hobbits are so bucolic and easygoing that their big ambition is probably no more impressive than than "I could use a bigger pantry", leaving the Ring nothing to work with.
</li><li> There's also Tom Bombadil who is so devoid of ambition that the ring has no effect whatsoever on him, not even it's standard invisibility. He settled down into his ideal lifestyle thousands of years previous and he ain't changing now. This also made him useless as a ring-bearer or guardian, despite him being possibly the most powerful individual in the world; it's so meaningless to him that Gandalf thinks he'd just lose the damn thing and never think about it again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> features one borderline and one straight example. The minor character Bronn follows a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">Rags to Riches</a> arc, starting as a lowborn mercenary who, though the strength of his sword arm and some calculated risks, rises to a noble's retainer, then a knight, and then a lord. He's ruthless, unscrupulous, and quick to sell out his employers when given a better offer, but so far doesn't seem to be actively malevolent. Petyr Baelish was born a minor lordling with only a stretch of rocky coast and a handful of peasants, but his knack with finance and his overpowering ambition transformed him into a wealthy power-player with a political vice-grip on the continent (do note though, that simple ambition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">isn't his</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">only motivation</a>). Not only does he have a habit of murdering and betraying people left and right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">his entirely self-serving scheming</a> was one of the key factors that lead to the new civil war. Which, as far as we know, was intentional on his part, thus making him directly and indirectly responsible for most of the bad things that happened in the series, including about half of Westeros being devastated by said civil war and most likely facing famine in the near future.
<ul><li> Tyrion comes to the conclusion that it's Littlefinger's limitless ambition that makes him one of the most dangerous men in the Royal Court, whilst everyone else thinks of him as pretty harmless. Varys makes a similar statement in the TV series.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePatriarch">Tywin Lannister</a> is a form of this. Tywin helped rule as Hand of the King for twenty years to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">King Aerys</a>, and his time as Hand of the King is widely regarded as peaceful and prosperous. But when Aerys named Tywin's eldest son and heir to the Kingsguard, making him ineligible to inherit Casterly Rock, Tywin resigned, and eventually turned on Aerys. His forces sacked King's Landing, while Cersei ended up married to Robert Baratheon. Tywin's driving ambition, as stated in both the books and TV series, is "legacy"— he speaks of establishing a dynasty that lasts a thousand years, and does some very ruthless things to accomplish his goals.
</li><li> Averted when it comes to Daenerys: her driving motivation is to seize the throne she believes is rightfully hers, and side-effects of some of her actions in service to this ambition include death and suffering, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">no more so than many other characters' actions,</a> and she's one of the better people in the setting.

Using his <em>personal</em> definition of "better", of course: a purely Communist state run along traditional lines... including thought police and the elimination of dissidents. As he puts it, "You can't make an omellette without breaking some eggs", and if the "eggs" in question just happen to be a village full of innocent men, women, and children, all of whom must be killed by their own government so that they can blame another country and start a war, then so be it.
</li><li> Morgan Sloat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalisman">The Talisman</a></em> is differentiated from his friends and partners by his ambition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em>: This trope has occurred a number of times. <em>Immortality in Death</em> has Jake T. Casto, a cop who specializes in illegal drugs, make the fact that he wants to be promoted to captain very plain. Which would be fine, except that he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> who has dealt in drugs, money, and murder. <em>Witness in Death</em> has this one traffic cop try to snatch an operation to arrest a suspect out of Eve's hands and winds up getting Trueheart and maybe the suspect shot.

Robert is even more generous, summing Tywin's goal up as "wanting to own the world". His outsize ambition is the main reason why he doesn't get along very well with his children  in his eyes, they've done nothing with their lives without his help or name, or at least so he believes. He approves of Jaime's great skill as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Master Swordsman</a> but is disappointed that he doesn't apply himself. As for Cersei, he feels that she didn't do enough in her position as Queen and did a poor job raising Joffrey. As for Tyrion, from his perspective Tyrion was content to spend all his time drinking and whoring until Tywin appointed him Hand and later Master of Coin. From Tyrion's perspective, he hardly ever got opportunities because his father kept insulting him with tasks like manage the cisterns of Casterly Rock and even when Tyrion did great at that, hardly considers it indicative of any talent.

Despite having alleged noble ends, Stannis is bound and determined that absolutely no one but <em>him</em> should sit on the Iron Throne, and every time he has to choose between ambition and his family (or his honor, or his principles) he chooses ambition. Ultimately this results in his downfall, as even hired sellswords can't stomach the lengths to which he is willing to go and abandon him en masse, leading to his defeat by the Boltons and execution at the hands of Brienne. This exception is, of course, in the backstory, where Stannis supported his family and nearly starved to death in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSiege">The Siege</a> for a brother he never even liked because blood is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">Thicker Than Water</a> rather than support his lawful ruler who would undoubtedly have rewarded him handsomely, most likely by fulfilling Stannis' ambition to be Lord of Storm's End.

First, with most of the non-evil characters high school students, the monsters and villains become distinguished as those who know exactly "what they want to do when they grow up" - they're doing it. More broadly, the show (based on commentaries, deliberately) emphasizes evil and good as proactive and reactive.

Organized efforts to protect people <em>before</em> they're in danger turn out to have been corrupted from the very beginning. Even when the goal is simply to help people who need it (the homeless shelter in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em>, headed by a genuinely good person), there are hints of evil as entropy: proactively doing good on a local scale inevitably means contributing (at a net loss) to greater if vaguer evils. This seems to end in Buffy's season seven. Maybe. Lindsey, a villain, had a driving motive of his cynicism and ambitions, as pointed out by his actor:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Christian Kane:</strong> I still think this cat looks at the glass as being half empty. And so, damn it, Im going to drink the rest of that water.
</div></li><li> Never, <em>ever</em> go on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">reality show</a> and express a desire to <em>actually win</em>. After all, that'd be silly- who'd enter a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameShow">Game Show</a> with the intention of succeeding?
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouCantDoThatOnTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouCantDoThatOnTelevision">You Can't Do That on Television</a></em> specifically dealt with ambition. One of the cast members remarked that the problem with ambition was "If you don't have enough, you're lazy. And if you have too much, you're ruthless. You can't win." His solution? Be lazy and get a ruthless manager.
</li><li> HBO's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> argues that every system, from law enforcement to schools to government, is hamstrung by personal ambition. Everyone is too obsessed with advancing their own careers to actually do what is best for the community; since selflessly trying to do what's right, even if you succeed, causes you to fall behind in the race for status, the people who end up on top are always the people who sacrifice the most morality to achieve their goals.
</li><li> There are some indications on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> that Sam's desire to go to school was bad.
<ul><li> His desire for the power to stop Lilith is treated as bad only partly because of the way he goes about getting it.
</li><li> Similarly, in the episode "It's a Terrible Life," the moral of the story can be seen as "being a businessman is evil."
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat subverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>: Main character Rachel is <em>extremely</em> ambitious, but it's portrayed in both good and bad ways: her insistence on always getting the spotlight alienates people, but her go-getter attitude combined with her talent is ultimately what will save her from the fate of many of her classmates (being stuck in Lima, OH). Certainly, she's never seen as evil. On the other hand, we have Sue, who single-mindedly pursues her goal of destroying Glee Club - and there's Terri, Will's wife who cruelly pushes him to give up teaching and become an accountant so they make more money.
<ul><li> Rachel often seems to lack perspective, and goes to extreme lengths such as sending Sunshine to a crack house to scare her out of the glee club, this eliminating her (perceived) competition. By the end of Season 2, though, Rachel seems to have learned her lesson. She'll still be ambitious, but she's going to be nicer about it. Hopefully...
</li><li> Will <em>is</em> ambitious, though. It's just that these ambitions are directed toward elevating the McKinley High Glee Club as high as possible, rather than making money.
</li></ul></li><li> Anyone in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em> who has ambitions is evil. The only people with ambitions are portrayed as being self-centered, selfish, and just plain bad. Some examples:
<ul><li> Frank is always an antagonist, but any time he's in charge, it goes to his head and everyone turns against him.
</li><li> Generals and colonels are often portrayed as people who care more about their careers than anything else.
<ul><li> In one episode, Potter gives a brief speech outlining exactly how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> each officer rank is likely to be based on how far away they are from real prestige. (He concludes it with a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">Hypocritical Humor</a>, noting that colonels are the worst, since "they can practically taste those stars.")
</li></ul></li><li> When Winchester joins the cast, he wants to be head of thoracic surgery at a Boston hospital.
<ul><li> Then again, Winchester is also portrayed as more than competent enough to handle this. Unlike Frank, his antagonism comes from a clashing personality as opposed to incompetence. By the end of the show, this troper wanted him to run that hospital!
</li></ul></li><li> When the soldier of the month board is coming up, everyone in the competition stoops to some low activities (brown-nosing, cheating) to get ahead.
</li><li> One episode sees the company clerk, Radar, promoted from Corporal to Lieutenant. He's then put in charge of his "friends," who decide that since he's now an officer, he's automatically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> and no longer their buddy - even though he's shown to be quite laid back, and is only doing the job he was assigned. Radar is so troubled by this that at the end of the episode he asks to be demoted back to Corporal.
<ul><li> There was also a nurse who had a crush on him. She was always making passes at him, but he didn't act on them because he was only a lowly corporal. When he's promoted to lieutenant, the nurse loses interest in him and explains that the only reason she was attracted to him in the first place was because it was wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted with Father Mulcahy, who pushes for promotion but remains a nice guy. And it was because he was jealous of a colleague getting a similar promotion!
<ul><li> Not quite subverted - he's shown regretting his actions and talks about the sin of pride.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Similarly, in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays">Happy Days</a></em> Richie becomes leader of his squad in ROTC. Ralph and Potsie think it's an invitation to goof off and somehow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAesop">he's the bad guy for punishing them for it.</a>
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em>, this is explicitly given as the reason why genetic engineering is illegal in the Federation, with Khan as the defining example (naturally, this overlaps heavily with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>). It's specifically mentioned that "superior ability breeds superior ambition", and that dabbling in genetic engineering risks the creation of another superhuman like Khan, "whose ambition and thirst for power have been enhanced along with his intellect."
<ul><li> Gowron is an example. He was presented as a Klingon who genuinely gave a crap about honor. Indeed, he was a political outsider who often opposed the High Council. But as time went by, he cared more and more about keeping his position as leader of the Empire secure, to the point of deliberately sending a brilliant general he viewed as a rival on impossible missions.
</li><li> Kai Winn was genuinely dedicated to her faith and her people during the occupation. Her desire to become Kai led her to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacist">Fantastic Racist</a>, a murderer, a terrorist, and eventually a traitor.
</li><li> Sisko and Martok are examples of the opposite. When Akorem Laan, a poet, was transported to the future and thought he was the emissary, rather than try to adapt to his new time, he used his newfound power to force everyone else to adapt to him, by returning to the abandoned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Fantastic Caste System</a>, and he didn't care how much suffering he was causing. It's clear that what made Sisko such a good emissary was the fact that he didn't want to be emissary, and thus he couldn't abuse his power because he was too reluctant to even acknowledge he had it. Similarly, Worf thought Martok would make a good chancellor because he refused to seek the position, even though he could have taken it.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Worf</strong>: Great men do not seek power. They have power thrust upon them.
</div></li></ul></li><li> Arguably, the US version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS">The Office</a></em>. In the first few seasons, Dwight and Angela are the meanest employees who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnpopularPopularCharacter">the most unpopular with their coworkers.</a> They are also the most driven, hard-working and likely to take charge. Then Andy was added to the cast and he was originally characterized as someone who, like Dwight, would stop at nothing to become Number Three in the office. By the time he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a> this goal had mysteriously disappeared. Ryan was corrupted with power when he got promoted to corporate and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">Took a Level in Jerkass</a>, to extreme levels. Jim is at his best when he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> and whenever he takes on management duties he finds himself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyAtTheTop">Lonely at the Top</a> and is unsure of how to handle the job. Pam has always had an ambitious streak (even if it was repressed at first) which appears to run much deeper than that of Jim. However, while she originally had the sympathetic goals of wanting to prove herself talented and capable and escape her disliked receptionist job ever since she came back from Pratt she has gradually become more concerned with making money than being competent and has undertaken more questionable means of getting herself promoted. In fact, the only notably ambitious character who neither does mean things just to get ahead of others nor gets an intelligence downgrade after being promoted is Karen (she was sometimes mean to Pam because she was a rival love interest, not out of ambition). And that's because she was always going to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DieForOurShip">unrelated reasons.</a>

Phrases like "The world doesn't need Lex Luthor to save it" were bandied about <em>constantly,</em> with the implication that because of his <strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">DENSITY</a></strike> destiny to be Superman's greatest enemy (which no one knew at the time because PREQUEL) meant that any and all efforts he made to be something other than a regular nobody would end in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And with his murder by Oliver Queen and having been effectively replaced by his clone, it seems all of that worrying was for absolutely nothing.</span>

Admittedly, Ralph has a tendency to go with get rich quick schemes, but if the level headed Alice actually helped steer his ambition instead of belittling him, they might actually prosper.

<ul><li> The central theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderOOO">Kamen Rider OOO</a></em> is desire, and most of the story arcs are about dealing with some ambition that's run out of control.

However, Hubrises aren't explicitly considered evil traits, just dangerous ones, and characters that have one are just as heroic as anyone else. (The game also includes such Hubrises as "Loyal", "Misfortunate" and "Star-crossed".)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>, ambition is one of the things represented by the color black. Granted, black is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">not always evil</a>, but it is the usual home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> creatures. Personified by Bontu, the <em>God</em> of Ambition on the plane of Amonkhet, which drove her personality so much that she allied with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Nicol Bolas</a> in order to gain more power.

They are named Passion, Revenge, Judgement, and Ambition, and greatly increase the given emotion/feeling in their wielder to an extremely unhealthy level. Throughout the story, two separate individuals have wielded Ambition. Both tried to murder the Emperor and take over his throne. Both ended poorly for the individual in question.

The other nations have their own ideals that can cause conflict, but the Barathi are the easiest to hand for any GM who wants a sinister plot driven by someone's desire for power. Ambition is even listed as one of the fatal flaws that distinguishes a swashbuckling villain from a hero, becoming consumed by the need to win.
<ul><li> Characters can also easily take "Ambition" as a Foible (similar to the Hubrises of <em>7th Sea</em>), which is an open invitation for any GM to have it bite them in the ass. Then again, they can also take it as a Motivation or other Forte so that an ambitious nature works for them rather than against.

<ul><li> Brett Andrews is one of the worse cases, as the ilKhan(Khan of all the Clans) he puts his personal ambitions and ideas over the betterment of all the Clans. He instigated the Wars of Reavings which resulted in the Clans tearing each other apart, while his Clan the Steel Vipers benefited from it, at the expense of the rest of the Clans.
</li><li> Hanse Davion avoids falling into this trope mainly by not actually being especially <em>ambitious</em>, at least not by Successor Lord standards. Cunning, yes, ruthless where he needs to be, too...but he does have a conscience and at heart genuinely believes that the people he conquers will in fact be better off than they were under their old oppressive regimes (and considering who his primary enemies in his time are it's not too difficult to see <em>why</em> he would think so). So from his perspective it's actually <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">All About Him</a>. (Compare and contrast his daughter Katherine, who in her own grab for power after his death plays the trope dead straight and promptly ends up thoroughly wrecking the very Federated Commonwealth he's only just helped establish again.)

Hamilton keeps pushing Burr to be more active and ambitious, but the first big crack in their relationship comes when Burr switches parties to run against Hamilton's father-in-law for a Senate seat, which Burr wins. Burr tells Hamilton that Hamilton inspired him to aspire higher, as far as the Presidency, but as Burr aims higher and higher the two men grow farther and farther apart, culminating in Hamilton endorsing his old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> Jefferson over Burr in the Election of 1800.

<ul><li> This is both played straight and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.</em> The show's main bad guys are the firebenders. Fire is described as being the element of power and those who practice it have desire and will and the energy and drive to achieve what they want. They are, by their nature, ambitious. However, we are also shown many characters, including firebenders, whose ambition drives them to improve themselves and the world around them. Of special notice is Fire Lord Sozin; his seemingly earnest ambition started the show's conflict generations later.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DCAnimatedUniverse">DC Animated Universe</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> was driven by a noble but unrealistic cause to rid all crime from Gotham city, which ultimately caused him to alienate the people closest to him. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em>, all his vision got him was living utterly alone, in a city that is even worse off than when he was still Batman.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond">Batman Beyond</a></em> also has Derek Powers, who wants to build his company, Wayne-Powers,into the most powerful force in future Gotham, and he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">not afraid to throw away all scruples to do it.</a> It'd probably be easier if it weren't for his condition acting up at inconvenient times, and that annoying kid in a batsuit messing up his plans.
</li><li> For Eddy (along with his friends, who are far less deserving) of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a> by the end of an episode, usually because he is a scam artist who attempts to weasel the other kids out of money. However, even if they manage to pull off a relatively legitimate business with rather impressive efforts they will still end up getting screwed over badly.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuntikSecretsAndSeekers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HuntikSecretsAndSeekers">Huntik: Secrets &amp; Seekers</a></em>'s <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">villain Wilder</span> is definitely this, to the point his ambitions about ruling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSyndicate">The Syndicate</a> blind him. Clear and looming threats, combined with his Demonic Summons titans and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> personality make for a villain who doesn't listen to facts or care about the consequences as long as he gets what he's after.
</li><li> Catra in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> is this, due to a childhood of abuse and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSecondBest">being unable to escape from her best friend's shadow</a>. She's fully aware that she's working for the villains, but sees climbing up the chain of command as the best path for proving that she's her own person deserving of praise and respect. The reason why she refuses to take Adora's offer to follow her and join the rebellion isn't just because of a sense of betrayal<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note36g7v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note36g7v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note36g7v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Catra had hoped they'd stick together and eventually take over the Horde. Outside of that, she's hurt that the catalyst for Adora's desire to leave was hanging out with some random teens for a few hours, rather than her best friend's suffering.</span>, but also because doing so would leave her back at square one: stuck as Adora's sidekick and seen as a background nuisance by everyone else.
</li><li> Deconstructed in the season 22 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">Simpsons</a></em> episode "Lisa Simpson, This Isn't Your Life." Lisa spends an episode dreading ending up like Marge and transfers to an elite private school. Sitcom law dictates that the children there must be insufferable snobs, sending her running back to good ol' Springfield Elementary. Instead, the school suits her perfectly and looks like it absolutely would improve her chances in life. But late in the episode, she discovers the long hours Marge works to cover the tuition. The discovery leads to her lying about how the children <em>are</em> snobs and how she'd rather turn out like Marge, feeling guilty about the strain her attending private school puts on her mother. The lesson here being that ambition itself may not be evil, but <em>fulfilling</em> it can be, because it requires not caring who you have to step on to get ahead.

Other teams want it, but to Jacques and Josee, it's an obsession.
</li><li> Megatron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> started this way. What he initially wanted was to bring social reform to a caste-bound Cybertron, and believed himself to be worthy of the title of Prime.

As he says in Transformers Prime, he is <em>no</em> stranger to ambition.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ZorroTheChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ZorroTheChronicles">Zorro: The Chronicles</a></em>: Corporal Gonzales desperately desires to become sergeant in Garcias' place, and is willing to follow any order Monasterio gives while showing up Garcia at any opportunity, in order to achieve this goal.
