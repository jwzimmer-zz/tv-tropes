<ul><li> Arata from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArataTheLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ArataTheLegend">Arata: The Legend</a></em> is a wanted criminal due to having been framed for the attempted murder of Kikuri-hime. By extension, Hinohara is this as well due to swapping places with Arata and having his image in the eyes of other people.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, the Survey Corps were already largely considered a joke and a waste of valuable resources due to how unsuccessful the majority of their missions are. However, it's not until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their reckless plan to capture Annie, aka the Female Titan, results in the death of hundreds and the near complete destruction of Stohess District</span> that their public opinion <em>really</em> starts to plummet.

</li></ul></li><li> Guts from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> has been treated as a dangerous villain by townspeople and the authorities since he started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth">Walking the Earth</a> as the Black Swordsman when he is actually just a sometimes ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> who is assumed to be — and actively pretends to be — worse than he is. In the first place, he's on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> against the demonic Apostles who killed everyone he cared about, and he claims not to care about collateral damage. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea">Walking Disaster Area</a> because confronting an Apostle on their home turf invariably escalates into an all out war that causes the streets to run with the blood of (more or less) innocent bystanders, and by the end of it everybody who knows the truth of what happened is either dead or on the run, leaving him as the scapegoat. It doesn't help that he looks a lot like a villain because he's dressed all in black, and tries to act like a total bastard toward anyone who starts to get friendly with him in order to drive them away for their own good. There's also the fact that demons and Apostles that he kills turn back to their human form after they're killed so that if the monsters' original form had been children, he ends up looking like a mass child murderer to anyone who arrives on the scene afterwards. That causes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> Farnese of the Holy Iron Chain Knights to pursue and arrest him because she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">convinced that he's a servant of evil</a>. After all these misunderstandings he's gotten sick of trying to explain himself because everybody always assumes that he's evil anyway, and he figures that at least if he scares them, they might keep the hell out of his way. Fortunately, his reputation as a hero has improved somewhat since the Millenium Falcon Arc gave him the chance for some high-profile heroics, and some of his best sidekicks now are former enemies who realized that he was right all along.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackJack">Black Jack</a></em> is a brilliant surgeon who truly cares for his patients, but his outrageous fees and bad attitude give him a bad reputation.
</li><li> Victor Freeman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlasterKnuckle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlasterKnuckle">Blaster Knuckle</a></em> hunts demons that revert to a human form when killed, and have often taken the forms of women and children. The first issue kicks off with him stomping into a saloon and gunning down a pretty brunette pleading for help (she was actually a demon, but...).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em>, Zearth is so destructive it's considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a>. They even assassinate a kid who claims to be a pilot. In the manga, it's somewhat alleviated when Anko appears on television to tell the world the pilots' mission, inform them about the stakes and apologize for the damage.

In a twist, there's a seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentConspiracy">benign</a> government task force that recognizes the Digidestined's role in the crises, and are willing to give a helping hand.

The recent anime just barely scratches the surface of this plot and is the only non-manga iteration to get up to even that point.

She's a thoughtful, reserved and apparently cold and aloof loner, feared as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapaneseDelinquents">delinquent</a> at school. That's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisunderstoodLonerWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisunderstoodLonerWithAHeartOfGold">she is in truth a selfless and brave girl</a>, able to save other people and defend herself from male thugs - yes, she's 15 but really defeats entire gangs of delinquents.
</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a></em> has this problem early on. In the first chapter, aliens actually <em>cancel</em> their invasion plans rather than fight Kinnikuman, the only hero available at the time. A bit later, the Japanese government allows American superhuman Terry Man to become their resident hero, in spite of the fact he charges for his rescues because it's <em>still</em> better than being saved by Kinnikuman.
</li><li> Mist from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Knights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Knights">Knights</a></em> is generally feared and hated because he's black and he's in a Medieval European-esque setting with an overwhelmingly white population. Just about everybody in this society believes that witches are real and that the Church is infallible, so Mist's attempts to rescue wrongly convicted witches from burning at the stake are seen as heretical and treasonous.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LetterBee">Letter Bee</a></em>, the Letter Bees are the only ones capable of carrying mail across the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">Gaichuu</a>-infested wastelands of Amberground, as well as the only ones capable of fighting the Gaichuu. Unfortunately, since the Letter Bees are government employees and the government is rather corrupt, people are naturally suspicious of them. This is part of the reason why Lag's aunt, Sabrina Mary, acts hostile toward Gauche despite being grateful to him for delivering her nephew. Her town relies on a illegal port to survive, so the town is wary of government employees.

<ul><li> The straw hats tend to be treated like this, they do a lot more good than harm, but still get chased out of places due to technically being pirates and series of bad coincidences.
<ul><li> This is mostly because the World Government would rather eat their shorts than admit that a band of pirates are more effective than their own forces (Especially since said forces are the villains Luffy's crew typically fight). During the Fishman Island Arc, Luffy outright states he doesn't <em>want</em> to be seen as a hero... for rather off reasons. The Straw Hats don't mind helping people and admire those that do, but they're not that interested in getting good press.

He was a truly strong and courageous explorer who saved the Shandians from being wiped out by disease, as well as who knows how many other deeds.

The truth is that Saitama <strong>is</strong> that powerful, and has saved humanity from extinction several times over even before the series began; at first he got no credit because he wasn't registered with the Hero Association<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2s8iu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2s8iu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2s8iu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and people latched onto a random bystander who happened to be at the scene every time, turning him into an unintentional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">Fake Ultimate Hero</a></span>, but afterwards he willingly cultivated the image of a lazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> because he realized the idea of a nigh-invincible fighter diminished all the other heroes in the public's eyes.

</li><li> At first glance, Shogun Ienari in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ooku">Ooku</a></em> looks like a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">Adaptational Heroism</a>, due to how different he is (well meaning, secretly working against his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Evil Matriarch</a> mother, actively promoted treatment and vaccination against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gendercide">Gendercide</a> plague) from how Ienari was in real life (a spendthrift who cared more about his harem than government). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">On his deathbed, he tells his wife he ordered the scribes to portray him as the spendthrift pervert, in order to suppress any knowledge of the Redface Pox from foreign powers who may take advantage of the disproportionate gender ratio and invade Japan.</span>
</li><li> This trope seems to disproportionately affect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark-type</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">Ghost-type</a> Pokémon.

When the war ended, she was left to watch over the world, as their "caretaker".
</li><li> To the Church of Mauser, George Browning is considered a satanic figure and a heretic, along with those who follow his teachings. In truth, he was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a human, like Celia. But unlike her, he was committed to fighting the aliens in order to free humanity from their control.

This persists even when he continues to rise up in the ranks of his school. Later on, it's revealed that the students continue to disparage Soma despite his achievements due to envy and their own inferiority complexes because if they acknowledge Soma's skill it would mean to acknowledge that they themselves do not work as hard as he does. His reputation does improve eventually when the student body can no longer ignore his skill as he continues to rise to the top.

<ul><li> Seriously, what hero in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> (besides <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>) DOESN'T have bad publicity?
</li><li> The instigation for the events in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CivilWar">Civil War</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">crossover</a> is a large amount of collateral damage (including a few hundred dead children) due to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">Taking You with Me</a> villain. For a brief time, <em>all</em> the heroes have bad publicity — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVictimsBadVictims" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVictimsBadVictims">especially the few surviving New Warriors</a>. The government's idea of damage control is, of course, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRegistrationAct">Super Registration Act</a> that promptly pits hero against hero. Public opinion then gives all the non-compliers bad publicity. When the new 'government-sponsored heroes' turn out to have overlooked a massive planet-wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion">infiltration by aliens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderWoman">Spider-Woman</a> wind up with bad publicity. At this point the government decides to put noted psychotic and multiple-murderer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> in charge, due to his brief moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsDoTheDirtyWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsDoTheDirtyWork">Villains Do The Dirty Work</a>. This works out about as well as you'd expect, thus leaving the reader to wonder if the <em>US government</em> isn't being depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>.
</li><li> The anti-mutant prejudice in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em> labels probably qualifies, although this can also be seen as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>. Anti-mutant sentiment is so strong that the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XFactor">X-Factor</a></em> masqueraded as anti-mutant crusaders to endear themselves to the public.
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronMan">Iron Man</a> falls prey for this. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArmorWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArmorWars">Armor Wars</a> storyline, Iron Mans fighting against S.H.I.E.L.D, hes kicked out of the West Coast Avengers, nearly causes an international incident in the U.S.S.R and gets into a fight with Captain America.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>:
<ul><li> Spider-Man gets a lot of undeserved flak, mostly due to the negative PR campaign by his employer, J. Jonah Jameson. Probably the first superhero to have this as his status quo.
</li><li> Within the first twenty issues it was revealed JJ felt jealous of Spidey's successes. Later revelations included <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">being beaten by his stepfather</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllOfTheOtherReindeer">a mistrust of superheroes</a>, and JJ's own failure to live up to the high standards he sets for himself. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em>, JJ hates Spider-Man because he wears a mask, and his wife was killed by a masked man.
</li><li> Though he is always the first to accuse Spider-Man of crimes, JJ is also usually the first to retract his statement when he is proven wrong, at one point remarking that he believes that <em>claiming</em> Spidey to be a menace prevents him from actually <em>becoming</em> one. Furthermore, regardless of the Daily Bugle's libel, there is enough evidence to suggest that the New Yorkers are not so easily manipulated anymore and <em>will</em> rally behind Spider-Man.
</li><li> Jameson eventually became the Mayor of New York City — and as you might expect he constantly leveraged his expanded sphere of influence against Spider-Man.
</li><li> There is the fact that Peter began his superhero career as a teenager with no guidance and tended to be a wisecracking jerk who often screwed up and lost, and also tried more than once to draw a paycheck for it (nobody knows he needs the money to take care of his aunt). A bad first impression is hard to shake. Plus, being immature, he tended to egg on JJ or get angry at him (which could be interpreted as threatening).
</li><li> Interestingly, while the public and the police are quick to believe the worst about Spider-Man, and his "friends" in the superhero community <em>rarely if ever stick up for him at all</em>, it has been shown on several occasions that most of the villains in his Rogue's Gallery know he is a decent man and innocent of just about everything he's accused of. This was highlighted in an early issue of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a>, when Spider-Man was accused of a crime and the team of villains-pretending-to-be-heroes was trying to develop a plan to capture him in order to get good publicity. Mach-One, who was really the Beetle in disguise and had fought Spider-Man many times, told the team that the best thing to do was to go to the scene of the crime and wait for Spider-Man to show up and start investigating himself. When asked why he was so sure Spider-Man would do that, Mach-One responded with: "Because he's innocent. He'd never do anything like this. He'll be looking for the person who did." During this same issue, Mach-One fought alongside Spider-Man and was so impressed that this event was the beginning of him trying to turn his life around and become a real hero, which also spread to several other members of the team.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanVsTheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SupermanVsTheAmazingSpiderMan">Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man</a></em>, Superman initially thinks Spidey may be connected with a phony Superman because of Jameson's smear. Supes realizes his mistake right away, though.
</li><li> Perhaps one of the biggest reason why Spider-Man gets a lot of publicity (particularly the police force) is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">total unwillingness to kill the supervillains that he fights against</a>. In fact, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Otto Octavius inside Peter Parker's body, manages to <em>win</em> public support by killing Massacre. Something that Peter Parker himself is unwilling to do because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfYouKillHimYouWillBeJustLikeHim">he's aware of the moral hazards</a>. Apparently, the public isn't really happy about Spidey fighting a supervillain, sending the villain to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">jail</a>, only to escape again and commit crimes that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadtoWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadtoWorse">worse</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">something that Otto himself pointed out</a> to Ghost Peter). Because apparently, the governments inability to execute/permanently incarcerate villains is totally Spidey's fault.</span>.
<p></p></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate</a> line of Spider-Man comics, JJ initially only wanted to make headlines. This quickly changed, however. It came to a head after The Bugle publicly started to support Sam Bullit, who was running on an anti-vigilante (in other words, anti-superheroes) campaign. But later, after an attempt on his life by some of the Kingpin's goons, JJ went to Peter's house (after having fired Peter from his job at the Daily Bugle earlier) and revealed his deeper reasons. He'd launched a smear campaign against Spider-Man because he didn't like the fact that his own son, who had died in a space shuttle accident (a real hero in Jameson's eyes), wasn't thought of as one and didn't get the attention he deserved, while everyday people looked up to a guy swingin' in his underwear.
<ul><li> Finally inverted later on, though. After Jameson sees Spider-Man risking his life to save a woman during a flood, he does a total 180 and devotes the Bugle's energies to supporting him.
</li><li> In fact, after the Ultimatum wave, Jameson becomes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">one of Spider-Man's greatest advocates</span>. For instance, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> when he discovers Peter's identity, he uses the information to clear Spider-Man's name without revealing his secret identity. He then gives Peter his job back and offers to pay for his college tuition. Eventually, when Spider-Man dies, he attends the funeral and comforts Aunt May in her time of need</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Humorously, the alternate future of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelComics2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MarvelComics2">Marvel Comics 2</a></em> sees JJJ as a big fan and major supporter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a>, the daughter of the hero he had slandered.
</li><li> This is exaggerated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em> where Jameson's smear campaign is not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverAcceptedInHisHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverAcceptedInHisHometown">more effective</a>, but less deserved as he's become an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and has never egged-on JJ, thus giving less credence to it. The beginning of Season 3 finally averts this. Spidey joining and becoming a successful Avenger results in the general populace of New York loving him.
</li><li> Apparently, it comes with the webs, because across the Multiverse it's revealed that numerous Spider-Men/Women/Girls have this going for them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a> is wanted for the murder of her Peter Parker and has drawn gunfire from police officers. The steampunk Lady Spider has been labelled a menace by J. Jonah Jameson in her world. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManNoir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderManNoir">Spider-Man: Noir</a> isn't much loved where he comes from. And they're all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderVerse">bouncing around</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WebWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WebWarriors">the multiverse</a> filling in where other Spider-Men were killed or lost and finding themselves not necessarily welcome.
</li><li> Subverted for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Silk">Silk</a></em>, who is probably the only Spider-Hero other than the aforementioned alternate universe Spider-Girl to be liked by J. Jonah Jameson from the start. JJJ is a fan of Cindy Moon's alter ego and also acts as a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> for her. Which makes things interesting once Cindy starts working as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> and <em>tries</em> to actively ruin her reputation and be labeled a menace to strengthen the facade. Instead, Jonah begins coming up with a number of excuses for her villainous behavior, refusing to believe Silk has actually gone bad. Later on, Cindy ends up devastated when an <em>actually</em> evil version of her from Spider-Gwen's dimension shows up to commit a major crime spree, causing Jameson to finally lose faith in her.
</li><li> Lampshaded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRaimi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamRaimi">Sam Raimi</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderMan1">the first movie</a>, where, after Spider-Man rescues numerous people from a burning building, several cops arrive and try to arrest him, in spite of him pointing out he had been rescuing people. Then a person inside the building starts screaming, and one of the officers demands Spider-Man rescue the woman and then come back down to be arrested.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a>. In fact, due to the damage he's caused in his career, it would be very hard to find someone in the Marvel Universe with <em>worse</em> publicity who could still be considered a hero.
</li><li> Played literally in the 2006 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MsMarvel">Ms. Marvel</a> series, where Carol Danvers hires a publicist after a D-list villain (Stilt-Man) doesn't recognize her.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel">All-New, All-Different Marvel</a></em> era, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFalcon">Sam Wilson</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> has this problem: after a whistleblower revealed what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> was doing using Cosmic Cubes, Sam decided to take a stand and no longer be bipartisan. This has lead to his popularity tanking and people calling him names like "Captain Socialism". This has also damaged his friendship with Steve Rogers, as Sam no longer trusts the US Government to do the right thing and only <em>hopes</em> that they can, compared to Steve, who unabashedly believes they <em>will</em>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MsMarvel2014">Kamala Khan</a> is following in those footsteps when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a plot by HYDRA</span> ends up making Ms. Marvel look like a total sellout when her face is used to promote new and expensive apartments without her knowledge.

The American military and S.H.I.E.L.D. are just waiting for the team to step out of line and arrest them all. That they're supposedly run by A.I.M. has a lot to do with this.
<ul><li> For an added bonus, the team includes Hawkeye and Songbird, who have both been heroes with bad publicity themselves.
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> Over at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, no matter how hard he tries, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> goes up against negative public opinion fairly often... usually due to his own screw-ups and glory-hound nature. He's getting better but the nature of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">time-travel mission</a> means that, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresentDay">Present Day</a>, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> and is keeping up a "jerk act" so he <em>still</em> has bad publicity.

</li><li> Richard Wentworth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpider">The Spider</a>, had a habit of killing crooks by the score. While this behavior was justified within the stories, it did make the police and public think of him as a dangerous criminal in his own right.
</li><li> Just about all of the masked vigilantes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Watchmen">Watchmen</a></em> after they fell out of favor and costumed adventuring was made illegal — except for those who work for the American government. Of course, the only other one still active is Rorschach, and let's be fair — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">he's an insane person who does terrible things.</a>
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanAndTheOutsiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanAndTheOutsiders">Outsiders</a>' raison d'être is to be the team of superheroes that can do the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyBusiness">Dirty Business</a> and <em>know</em> they're going to come out with stains upon their name. Considering that it was funded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>, it makes sense but raises some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">interesting questions</a>. When Batman retook control of the team, he fired several of the members, pointedly because they weren't suited to that sort of reputation:
<div class="indent"><strong>Batman:</strong> Only criminals operate without constraints anymore, so we're going to <em>cultivate</em> the Outsiders' reputation as a team of <em>outlaws</em>. I didn't think you'd <em>mind</em> sparing Nightwing and Thunder that kind of stigma.
</div></li><li> While this tends to come up at some point in most incarnations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a></em>, it was a particularly strong theme in the original Marvel Comics run, where the humans frequently weren't even aware that there were two factions of Transformers, let alone that one of those factions might be better-intentioned than the other.
<ul><li> In particular, Walter Barnett of the Intelligence and Information Institute, inspired by one of his son's comic books, hired its writer, Donny Finkleberg, to portray "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotMaster">Robot Master</a>", who claimed to be in control of <em>all</em> the robots. When Finkleberg ended up a prisoner of the Decepticons, Megatron decided to keep the charade going, if only because it would invoke this trope for the Autobots. It didn't <em>quite</em> work, though, seeing as how it was kind of hard to explain why a madman bent on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Taking Over The World</a> would have two groups of robots under his control fighting each other, but fortunately for Finkleberg, he was able to escape before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">he outlived his usefulness to Megatron</a>.
</li><li> In the IDW sequel series <em>Regeneration One</em>, the Autobots definitely fall under this on Earth, seeing as how they failed to clean up after themselves when they left for good in 1991, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> inadvertently let Megatron <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">nuke the population to near extinction</a></span>.

In the first, the Autobots are considerably hated by the populace, as they are a security force for the corrupt government, and their leader, Zeta, levels a city to stop the Decepticons, who are the oppressed masses forming behind a charismatic leader, Megatron, and numerous citizens sympathize with them. The Protagonists even team up with him to stop their corrupt leader, and the second Megatron blows Zeta's head apart, he turns on the Autobots and the rest of the populace. The Autobots managed to rally the citizens (as well as getting the press on their side), and oust the Decepticons. The sequel continues to play with it, as much of the populace doesn't trust the Autobots, partly because of the old government, but mostly because people don't want to get involved in a war. Dai Atlas uses this distrust to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVersusGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodVersusGood">rally</a> people against Prime, but even then a few civilians just consider Atlas's group a bunch of cultists. At the end, the Decepticons have been thoroughly discredited, and despite the good publicity, most Cybertronians just leave rather than join the Autobots.

Humanity is aware that there are two factions of Cybertronians. They're also aware that in the instances where those factions have clashed, it's resulted in hundreds of thousands of human casualties and nearly got New York nuked. They're aware that Megatron is the leader of the faction called the Decepticons and is considered an enemy of the Autobots. They're aware that Megatron and Devastator were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasilyForgiven">allowed to join them</a> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">being executed for their crimes</a>. So humanity sees no reason to trust anyone who would turn around and let such mass-murdering war criminals join them with no apparent repercussions.

</li><li> In a complete 180 of his long-held status, Superman in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/New52">New 52</a> starts out as one of these (which is covered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ActionComics">Action Comics</a></em>.)

His approval rating dropped to just <em>twenty-five percent.</em>
</li><li> He previously had a bit of bad publicity during his Electric Superman phase where losing control of his powers made him dangerous briefly.
</li><li> Before that, there was a storyline a few years after Superman returned from the dead where stories started circulating that Superman had not returned from the dead and that this was another impostor. Seemingly backed up when Superman's body was found in his tomb (turned out to be an illusion placed by Brainiac.)
</li><li> Way back in the very first Superman stories, by way of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness">Early Installment Weirdness</a>, this happened <em>entirely</em> as a result of his own tendency for morally questionable actions. He started getting good publicity pretty quickly, though, since one of the city's most prominent reporters was <em>in love with him.</em> Being a reporter <em>himself</em> can't have hurt, either.

After one year she gets her act together and begins acting as an S-wearing hero, but it took some time for her initial behavior being forgotten. Likewise, Daily Planet journalist Cat Grant starts a negative PR campaign to smear Kara. She finally stops one year later when Supergirl saves her life.

Superman admitted that Justice League teammate Hal Jordan had nothing good to say about the Red Lanterns (even when they try to be heroes, Red Lanterns are generally regarded as violent, dangerous, blood-thirsty sociopaths); but he added that he judges people based on what they do, not what people say about them, and he forms his own opinions.

As such, her run through a Paris neighbourhood while trying to avoid an akuma results in her causing over a million dollars in property damage and several injuries. Chat Noir accepts her explanation quickly enough, as does Ladybug when Chat tells her, but Rabbit is first mistaken for an akuma by the media and then for a supervillain in her own right, earning the nickname "Jack Hammer". She does earn a few more defenders when she helps out civilians during the Road Rage attack, including Nino, but the media continue to question whether she's a hero or a menace. Alya even makes a Ladyblog video painting "Jack Hammer" as an agent of Hawk Moth, which persuades most of her class, some of whom have family members that were affected by the first "rampage".

The irony is that Jesse was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>- while the public at large thought he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue">Lovable Rogue</a>, he was actually a violent, brooding, paranoid lunatic who had recently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePurge">murdered</a> several members of his gang because he thought they'd betrayed him, including one that he shot from behind, just like what happens to him later. In private Ford confesses that, ultimately, the real reason he killed Jesse was that he seriously believed Jesse was going to kill him, and based on the evidence he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Properly Paranoid</a>.

Sure, he gets sainthood but quickly loses it. He and many members of his family are outlawed and die untimely deaths, his estates are forfeited, even his family's tombs are destroyed.
</li><li> Alaric Morgan had bad publicity from birth. He chooses to make use of this, cultivating his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShroudedInMyth">dangerous reputation</a> as a means of protecting himself; he often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsEvil">wears black</a> and he is open about the fact that he is Deryni, even if he doesn't perform magic openly. Despite this, he serves two kings loyally and effectively, often risking his life in the process. While he reaps many rewards, his reputation precedes him.

A side effect is that thousands of years later, Ender is reviled as the monster who killed the Buggers.

Despite being the rightful King by law, he is perceived as a scary usurper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">uncle</a> by the masses, a belief aided by slander and lies spread about him by the Small Council of King's Landing. His intimidating image is further compacted by his willingness to ally himself with a sorceress preaching the unpopular religion of R'hllor. A bad public image that his rough, coarse, blunt personality does few favors to help. However, among those followers closest to him and to us the reader we see that Stannis, despite all his personal flaws, is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">GRRM's</a> own words a righteous man.

<ul><li> The main character is feared and/or disliked by much of the teaching staff at Sunnydale High School. Initially, it was because they'd heard rumors about how she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">burned down the gym</a> at her old high school, but later she's the focus of a smear campaign directed by her principal. However, in the prom episode, the entire student body reveals that they knew that she had been protecting them all along and gave her a "Class Protector Award" in gratitude.
<ul><li> Even Joyce assumes Buffy is a juvenile delinquent, when she's actually trying to do the right thing.
</li><li> Even more pronounced in the Season Eight comics, where the Slayers are, suffice it to say, <em>controversially</em> heroic, in large part due to there being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Vampires With Good Publicity</a>. They've even been labeled a terrorist group by the U.S. government, due in part to the fact that Sunnydale was wiped off the map prior to this. Yeah, the whole purpose of the place was to serve as a buffet for demons and vampires, but few non-residents know that. It's not even entirely unjustified; Buffy's brilliant idea for funding her worldwide Slayer operation was to rob a Swiss bank with the aid of magic and Slayer powers; her justification was that it was insured. Meanwhile, the vampires are all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>.

</div></li><li> As of the Season Nine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">comics</a>, Buffy is pretty much universally despised by the magical community, including the Slayers who used to respect her, for destroying the source of Earth's magic. As for Angel, it's been stated that his image and reputation among them is even <em>worse</em> than Buffy's, due in part to the various atrocities he committed as Twilight.

<ul><li> After Luke survives Cottonmouth blowing up his building with a bazooka, Cottonmouth needs to recuperate his losses, as he's lost 80% of his cash reserves due to Luke attacking his stash houses. He decides to double down, recuperating his money while also trying to drive Luke out of Harlem by having his gang shake down and extort local businesses in the name of a "Luke Cage stupidity tax". The move backfires as the business owners go to Luke, who willingly recovers their money and possessions. Shades is savvy enough to realize that this move will backfire even before Cottonmouth implements.
</li><li> Mariah, Shades, and Diamondback all work to smear Luke in the public eye, first by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">framing him for Cottonmouth's murder</span>, and then by exploiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> and basic otherism, as he's not a Harlem native. For several episodes, it seems like it's working, as the police are doing everything in their power to find him (including militarizing to a disturbing extent), and hundreds of people show up for an anti-Luke Cage rally. However, later episodes show that the majority of the people in Harlem, especially those who know Luke personally, don't believe a word of it. One cop lets Luke escape when he's cornered, and when Luke inadvertently rescues Method Man from an armed robbery while he's running from the police, the owner of the store starts selling hoodies that look like Luke's bullet-ridden one. Many people in Harlem start wearing them to show solidarity with Luke, which makes it impossible for the police to find him.

Thankfully, once Danny, Ward, and Colleen recover the laptop full of evidence used to frame him, they are able to turn it over to the police, who quickly realize it was doctored.

<ul><li> This is shown to be at least partially true with Jaime in Season 3, when he reveals that he assassinated Aerys Targaryen to prevent him burning King's Landing to the ground.
</li><li> Tyrion is dismayed when he discovers that the people blame him for Joffrey and Cersei's actions, which he actually tried to stop, mostly because he is a dwarf. Not only that, he is also framed for Joffrey's death, and submitted to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">Kangaroo Court</a> where all his achievements are discredited and his personal lifestyle mocked at which points he publicly expresses contempt for his unjust reputation, deciding that he no longer cares about his reputation or trying to be a "hero" to gain the acceptance of a pack of ingrates. When he's eventually released by his brother, he decides to murder his father out of vengeance, righteous anger and hatred, permanently tarnishing his reputation in the eyes of Westeros.
</li><li> As far as the War of the Five Kings goes, Stannis is the one in the right, since Joffrey being a bastard makes him Robert's rightful heir as his eldest brother. He's also the only one to come to the aid of the Night's Watch when they put a call out to all of Westeros. Despite this, his cold and stern personality, combined with the concern over his worship of the Lord of Light, means very few respect him and fewer love him.
</li></ul></li><li> The Starks' reputation has suffered over the years but this is mostly averted by Season 6. "The Door" reveals that Ned Stark is remembered (or at least lampooned) as a boorish yokel who was executed for greedily trying to steal the throne rather than a noble martyr. King Robb and Talisa's love affair is blamed for the loss of the war. Jon is seen as a Night's Watch deserter who betrayed his oath as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch by letting Wildlings into the realm, who Northerners believe will rampage their lands. This causes House Umber to pledge their allegiance to the Boltons, whom they despise very openly, to defend themselves. The Umbers are the ones who give Jon's little brother Rickon to Ramsay as hostage. Sansa is seen as a glorified Southerner owing to her time in King's Landing and marriage to Tyrion and few powerful northern families support Jon or Sansa because neither of them are legally Starks.

</li><li> In the eyes of Grand Maester Pycelle, Egg was another madman who got himself killed while trying to hatch dragon eggs, ignorant or indifferent to any deeper intentions he might have had.
</li><li> While in his own words he isn't even close to a hero, Varys is one of the least malevolent members of the Small Council, and yet not a soul seems to trust or appreciate his job because of the widespread eunuch prejudice and the fact he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpymaster">The Spymaster</a> (considered "dishonorable" in the honor-obsessed society of Westeros).

He didn't like the job, but he wasn't overly cruel about it (at least, not in comparison to some of the other gods).

This isn't really explored until the fourth and final game since all characters that Zero interacts with prior to that game are Reploids who see him as a champion to their cause. It was in the fourth game that a colony of human refugees are introduced, and this trope is in full force.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> series plays with this trope in a rather interesting way:
<ul><li> The protagonists of the first game, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands1">Borderlands 1</a></em>, start as treasure hunters and thrill-seekers and happen to rid part of Pandora of its most dangerous bandit leaders along the way to the Vault, being praised as heroes by the inhabitants. That doesn't prevent Captain Steele, the Crimson Lance leader, to publicly call them dangerous outlaws, but no one else seems to care.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em>, more treasure hunters and thrill-seekers join in, and are quickly hunted by Handsome Jack, a villain of otherworldly proportions who doesn't hesitate to publish bullshit news about them burning orphanages or strangling kittens, and this time he has an audience buying his shit. Luckily for the protagonists, they still have allies not believing him.
</li><li> And comes <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!</a></em>, that lets you see the events between the two previous games from Handsome Jack's perspective. There you learn important things: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Jack wasn't the worst boss Hyperion ever knew, far from that; his first motives were rather understandable, to open a Vault for riches and to save all the inhabitants on Elpis from certain death by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Kill Sat</a>. While he had already committed various highly questionable actions by that point (including turning his daughter into his personal supercomputer) it wasn't until Moxxi, Roland and Lilith attempted to assassinate him and his Vault Hunters that he truly became the lunatic from the second game and that they were pretty much responsible for the events of <em>2</em>.</span>

Nod's Greg Burdett, a respected journalist, would help them fabricate news stories about GDI slaughtering villages and burning down orphanages. Nod's mainline troops would also regularly partake in a little bit of the random slaughter, usually so they could make it look like GDI did it. This was also the entire point of the last couple of missions of Nod's campaign, in which you were <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> working to hijack the GDI Ion Cannon to destroy a landmark (you go to pick), framing GDI for the attack</span>.
<ul><li> In the GDI campaign, this is played with. It <em>looks</em> like Nod's media campaign has brought UNGDI to the brink of being disavowed by the Security Council, with funding being suspended while investigations are made... and then, when Nod launches a major offensive, it is revealed that it was a trick by the GDI leadership, taking advantage of Nod's media edge to bait the Brotherhood into striking before properly building up its strength. You still have bad publicity, but it wasn't <em>so</em> bad as it looked to you or Kane.

He has to slink around Kakariko Village in order to achieve his objectives; if his neighbors spot him, they send for the guards to kill him.

Yikes. Still, it is pretty hard to resist doing this in-game, since the bow in the game is sold at the ridiculous price of 990 rupees (the rupee cap is at 999), and it takes a looooong time to save up that amount of money.

<ul><li> Depends if you're talking about an individual level or group level. Individually, most are nothing more than people caught in a bad situation or simply got shanghaied into the unit. By comparison; two characters are actually Lanseal graduates (the game's equivalent of West Point), one of which graduated with honors. (And that's not including the volunteers.) As a group, the unit's bad reputation has more to do with the fact that its commanding officers keep them on hand and use them explicitly for wet works than anything they actually do.

</li><li> Rex in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeneratorRex">Generator Rex</a></em> suffers from this very hard in "The Hunter", where the titular character Hunter Cain turns the general public against him by claiming he is infecting people with his nanites. Of course, Cain is lured into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngineeredPublicConfession">Engineered Public Confession</a> and exposed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em> dealt with this quite a bit. 'Eclipsed' featured a downturn in popularity due to the efforts of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> TV personality, while a much more drastic one in "Panic in the Sky" led to six of the League's founders turning themselves in to federal custody in order to clear their names.
</li><li> The Burners in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Motorcity">Motorcity</a></em>, especially Mike Chilton, the leader.

It certainly doesn't help that anti-Luna sentiment has reached a point where a national holiday is celebrated that claims she <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">eats children</a></em> (really, Celestia, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">thanks for letting it get that far</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">averted</a>, however, as eventually (though not before some misunderstandings), most ponies come to trust her again.

Mystery Incorporated</a></em> are mostly reviled by their townspeople. This is because Crystal Cove enjoys having a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScoobyDooHoax">Scooby Doo Hoaxes</a> to attract tourists (mostly not caring about how the bad guys are mostly doing this to steal something), and they don't appreciate a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids">meddling kids</a> spoiling the extra revenue. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Once the mayor is unmasked as a villain, the town officials become much more accepting of the gang, especially once they manage to catch the truly destructive Cry Baby Clown.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> Just like in the comics, Spider-Man suffers from this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSpectacularSpiderMan">The Spectacular Spider Man</a></em>. Oddly enough, J. Jonah Jameson at first shows some signs that he hates Spidey (although it is shown on the <em>Daily Bugle</em> newspapers), and simply views him as easy publicity but still tries to discredit him. However, similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>, a story about Spider-Man in a rival newspaper outsells the Daily Bugle's own story on his son's heroic landing of a space shuttle. As a result, Jameson finally snaps and begins a smear campaign against the web slinger.
</li><li> In the earlier series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManTheAnimatedSeries">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</a></em> as part of "The Alien Costume" trilogy, Spider-Man saves John Jameson's life (who mind you, is <em>JJJ's son</em>) after his spacecraft crashlands in George Washington Bridge. Unfortunately, Spidey gets into a tangle with the Rhino while doing so, and the Rhino steals off with a space rock than Spidey didn't even know about. Poor Peter Parker went home thinking that for once Spider-Man will get his due, only to learn that an incensed J. Jonah Jameson went on his own network accusing Spider-Man of stealing the rock, and offering a $1 million bounty on his capture. Parker even considered quitting being Spider-Man for a while, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSymbiote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSymbiote">a mysterious ooze</a> bonds with him. This starts a new set of problems when Spider-Man <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">acts more aggressively</a> during this time, particularly with Jameson.
</li><li> This is part of the series premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpiderManUnlimited">Spider-Man Unlimited</a></em>, as Spidey is blamed for the disappearance of John Jameson by Jonah to the point that his saving a fire fighter from falling debris <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpMistakenForAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelpMistakenForAttack">was mistaken by the fire fighter to be an attempt to attack him and the debris stopped Spidey.</a>
</li><li> This exaggerated in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a></em>, where unlike past series Spidey has pulled pranks on Jameson and is technically a vigilante, here Spidey works for S.H.I.E.L.D. and has never met him. Despite this, Jameson's smear campaign goes on and Spidey is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverAcceptedInHisHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverAcceptedInHisHometown">generally hated</a> by the people of the city until the third season.
</li></ul></li><li> In seasons 1 and 2 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em>, the citizens of Mewni mainly remember Star Butterfly as the princess that <em>set fire to the kingdom</em>. Her reputation starts to get better in season 3 after she settles down and starts to finally take her royal responsibilities seriously, only for all that good will to go down the drain when she decides to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbdicateTheThrone">Abdicate the Throne</a> to the pro-monster Eclipsa.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS2E10RisingTidesCrashingSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS2E10RisingTidesCrashingSkies">Rising Tides, Crashing Skies</a>", Ronaldo comes to the realization that the various monsters that attack Beach City are only there because of the Crystal Gems and that it would be safer for the humans living there if they left, using his vlog-documentary and "expert reporting" to stage his own one-man protest against them and tells them to leave... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">until it is brought to his attention that if they did leave, he would have nothing to blog</a>, thus pleads with them to stay (not that they actually planned to leave anyway).
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetSharks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetSharks">Street Sharks</a></em> get this constantly, to the point in which one of their friends has to point out to the police that if they were really guilty of one of the crimes they're accused of, they'd have to have been in two places at once. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> also gets everyone to blame their dad for creating <em>them</em>, so yeah.
<ul><li> This ends when Dr. Paradign fails in a massive public plan to mutate the entire city thanks to the Sharks. Followed by him turning into Dr. Pirhanoid in front of everybody. Exposing his villainy for all to see.
</li></ul></li><li> Superman has become this in the series finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>. Thankfully, he salvaged his reputation, but the events of the finale became a precursor to the Cadmus Arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League Unlimited</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles1987">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987)</a></em>: The Turtles themselves get this a lot, courtesy of April's boss Burne Thompson. It gets even worse during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedSkyTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedSkyTakeWarning">Red Sky seasons</a>, where after Shredder blows up the Channel 6 building, Burne, blaming the Turtles for it, goes full J. Jonah Jameson on them and does everything possible to make them look bad, and when Dregg, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> replacing Shredder for the final two seasons, uses propaganda to turn the entire city against them and make himself into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a>.
</li><li> A bit of a problem for the Autobots in season two of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>, presumably after the property damage of the first season starts sinking in. In the first season, it's mainly just Bulkhead who has a problem with this, as he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotKnowHisOwnStrength">a klutz who's strong enough to throw cars</a>.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersSuperGodMasterforce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TransformersSuperGodMasterforce">Transformers: Super-God Masterforce</a></em>, Hydra and Buster attack Ginrai in a populated with the intention of causing considerable enough collateral damage to turn public opinion against the Autobots. They actually succeed for a short while.
</li><li> The G1 two-part episode "Megatron's Master Plan" was all about this, to the point that the Autobots were exiled from Earth <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and their ship's navigation systems tampered with to send them into the sun.</span>
</li><li> Also, the Stunticons were mistaken for Autobots for the first few weeks of their existence due to conventional wisdom being "cars=Autobots". Oddly, no one ever seemed to think the Aerialbots were Decepticons...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>, Justice League popularity starts to take a nose-dive in season 2. At first, it's mostly fueled by political pundits, but then a group of new, popular aliens (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">who are actually preparing to take over</a>) manage to make the JL look everything from inept, trigger happy to outright deceitful.
