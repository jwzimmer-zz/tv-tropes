<ul><li> Older <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em> series have this, without any real way of escaping from an exploding mobile suit, at least during the One Year War to the end of Operation Stardust. From that point onward, mobile suits have an ejection pod that allows the pilot to to escape from non critical torso hits.
<ul><li> Averted with any mobile suit using the Core Block system (yes, this includes the Impulse Gundam from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>), and thus has a Core Fighter. The original Gundam's Core Fighter was designed primarily as a method for preserving valuable combat data should any of the Project V mobile suits be put out of commission. That the pilot would also be saved by this system was considered merely a side benefit: the combat data was what mattered, the pilot's job after ejecting would be to fly back to base so that the data could be preserved.
</li><li> The Zeong from the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">original series</a> also averted this: being as big as it was, they were able to mount the cockpit inside the head rather than the chest, thus allowing for a system for it to detach from the rest of the suit and function as an escape pod.
</li><li> Also averted in the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> - some of the Innovade mobile suits have the cockpit attached to the back which can be ejected and flown away.
<ul><li> Played straight with the Tieren that earned the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseNickname">In-Universe Nickname</a> "the coffin for the living".
</li></ul></li><li> The RB-79 Ball was derisively known to Federation Pilots as the "Mobile Coffin" since it was <em>just a Pod with rudimentary armor and a cannon</em>.
</li><li> The Prototype Mobile Suit Forbidden Blue from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSeed">Gundam SEED</a></em>'s MSV design series was intended for amphibious combat, using the original Forbidden's energy deflection system to mitigate the water pressure; however, this was its <strong>only</strong> means of resisting the pressure, meaning that if it lost power the suit would be crushed, earning it the nickname "Forbidden Vortex". Its upgrades, the Deep Forbidden and Forbidden Vortex, rectified this by adding a reinforced titanium shell around the cockpit pod.
</li><li> Both play straight and subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>, while there are escape pods for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">Schwalbe Graze</a> and later the Reginglaze, it doesn't protect the pilots from being impaled by melee weapons. And for the mass produced Graze and Gundam Frame suits, escape pods are completely non-existent as for the Gundam Frames requires direct user to mobile suit interface and cutting off the cord can result in death from the feedback.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em>, where, being in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobot">Real Robot</a> setting, people build in ejection seats. In the second movie, however, one of them jams in a warzone, leaving the pilot to die.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Xabungle">Xabungle</a></em>. Walker Machines are basically trucks with legs, and are just as vulnerable. The kicker, of course, is that not only does this make them easier to escape, but a ridiculously high percentage of the pilots live to talk about it; despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YoshiyukiTomino">Yoshiyuki Tomino</a> show, pretty much only named pilots run a risk of dying.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechaByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechaByAnyOtherName">ATs</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmoredTrooperVotoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmoredTrooperVotoms">Armored Trooper VOTOMS</a></em> are nicknamed 'steel coffins' <em>in-universe</em> for enough reasons that any sane safety board really wouldn't let them anywhere near a battlefield.
</li><li> The Lancelot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> doesn't have an ejection system, because Lloyd was too busy installing everything else he could think of into it. Suzaku thus <em>has</em> to rely on its supreme technological advantage, because he's not walking away from a fight otherwise. Ironic considering that Knightmare Frames were developed from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapePod">Escape Pods</a> with legs and every other one has an ejection system.
<ul><li> It fits him well in the second season as all the other Knights of the Round also lack ejection systems in their Knightmares. Knights of the Round are expected to either return with their machine intact, or die in it. The Lancelot itself <em>is</em> finally equipped with an escape device when C.C. takes it over, as she certainly isn't willing to risk herself (although being an immortal she'd survive anyway, albeit painfully). The Lancelot Albion, as a Knights of the Round unit, also seemingly lacks one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except it does have one, so Suzaku can fake his death as per Zero Requiem, timing his ejection as the machine explodes just right so nobody sees it and assumes him killed.</span>
</li><li> Speaking of C.C., Lelouch's Gawain from the first season is another rare example of a Knightmare without an ejection system. In the final battle of the season, C.C. went solo against Jeremiah's Siegfried and dragged the latter down to the bottom of the ocean. When the second season rolled around, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said that C.C. escaped by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodThingYouCanHeal">opening the cockpit and floating to the surface as the water pressure killed her multiple times</a>, and they couldn't actually show this on TV because it was far too gruesome.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarshipGirlYamamotoYohko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarshipGirlYamamotoYohko">Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko</a></em> all the ships the character use have a built in teleporter which teleports the pilot out of the ship when it's about to be destroyed.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMechByAnyOtherName">Para-Mails</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrossAnge">Cross Ange</a></em> might as well be called <strong>Un</strong>armored Coffins, as not only do they lack ejection seats, but in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformingMecha">flight mode</a>, the cockpit is <em>completely open air</em>. More than one pilot has been killed in the series by a direct shot to their exposed body.

</li><li> Russian Jaegers are designed to be like this. While other countries' Jaegers have an escape mechanism, it's a general rule for Russian pilots that if their Jaeger goes down, so do they.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Tabletopgame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> is a notable aversion, as most pilots will survive the destruction of their 'Mech even if they have to ride it down when it goes over, and all 'Mechs are equipped with sophisticated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat">automatic ejection systems</a> in the event of ammunition explosion or reactor containment loss. Similarly, since their armor is ablative, most suits of power armor can be reduced to failing wrecks that daylight can be seen through, but you still have to take one more shot to kill the person wearing it. Aerospace fighters have reliable ejection systems as well, though recovery has to be on hand if the pilot bails out in space. Naturally, mechwarriors that are careful to avoid direct damage to their mech's cockpits can walk away from most engagements.
<ul><li> Some of the classical 3025 battlemechs, due to the lack of CASE protection and poor placement of torso-mounted ammo stores, acquired nasty reputations as walking "Ammo Bomb" mechs due to how susceptible they are to critical hits to their ammo storage - when torched, that entire ton of SRM ammo will not only obliterate the body section it happens in, it will spill over into adjacent components (Read: the rest of the torso compartments), gutting the engines. In rare cases, the blast will also travel up to the cockpit, ejecting the mechwarrior's soul straight to Heaven. The downgraded Marauder 3R, which lacks the CASE blast protection of the SLDF Royal Marauders, is infamous for the ton of Autocannon ammo in one side torso without any other systems sharing space, so crits to that section of the mech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">can only do one thing</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">ProtoMechs</a> are highly Armored Coffins. They are often too slow to retreat even if they wished to, and destruction of the machine is destruction of the pilot.
</li><li> However, the Spider light mech, is an infamous death trap because it has <em>no ejection system</em>. To get out in combat, the pilot must physically climb out of the control chair (no easy task while wearing a 10 pound <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolHelmet">Neurohelmet</a>) in the tiny cabin, and climb through the hatch mounted below the armored glass.
</li><li> Similarly, early in its service-life the <em>Lucifer</em> aerospace fighter went through a redesign to repair major structural flaws, and one of the fixes required <em>deleting the ejection system</em>. Given that the type ended up spending more than five <em>centuries</em> as the Lyran Commonwealths mainstay medium fighter, one can only imagine how many pilots ended their careers (and lives) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSpaceDrifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSpaceDrifting">helplessly careening off into deep space</a> as a result. It is noted that the Draconis Combine, which is usually not afraid to spend the lives of its soldiers, warriors, and samurai, tends to refit any captured Lucifers <em>to reinstall the ejection system</em> before pressing them into service.
</li><li> It's worth noting that a MechWarrior can always turn his or her machine into an example of this trope by simply disabling the automatic ejection mechanism (more common since the advent of explosion-mitigating CASE for the ammo bins made it more likely that the 'Mech itself would survive) and then overstaying his or her welcome (even a vented explosion is rough on the pilot and combines with damage from other sources to knock out and possibly even kill him or her).
</li><li> This is also one of the downsides of conventional combat vehicles in the game and setting. Simply put, by default 'Mechs and fighters have ejection seats...and tanks and helicopters <em>don't</em>. Extreme compartmentalization (and a somewhat armored cockpit) means a battlemech can lose limbs without severe risk to the mechwarrior; at the same tonnage, the same autocannon shell that would knock an arm off a battlemech would tear a hole in a tank's side, killing the crew.
</li><li> The Clan Hunchback IIC is deliberately designed to be this; it has meager armor and poor endurance, as they are usually piloted by older solahma warriors (above 30) so they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">can die in the next fight</a>. Its even shaped like a coffin with arms and legs.
</li><li> Mechs with head mounted weapons have a bad reputation of getting their pilots killed, since the additional armor and power supply systems can interfere with the ejection system blowing the lid off the proverbial can. To properly illustrate the resulting issue, imagine a rocket propelled tomato plowing into a slab of metal. For example, the traditionally Capellan Vindicator battlemech has a Small Laser installed in the left side of the head that can interfere with the proper alignment of the ejection systems, making it likely the unfortunate ejecting mechwarrior is blasted out off-course and potentially out of control.

Due to an entertaining failure in the 'mech's CASE systems, merely striking the 'mech in the ammo storage area would automatically engage the 'mech's automatic ejection system, leading to its pilots accidentally ejecting even when in no particular danger. When the Daboku was rushed into battle, this led to pilots often invoking the trope by disengaging the automatic ejection system, as this was seen as preferrable to a 'mech that would be rendered inoperable by a single lucky hit.

A common fan joke is friction ensuing about Sentinel pilots regarding their machines as walking coffins with an above-mentioned Dreadnought in their midst.
</li><li> Ork pilots, on the other hand, have no such problems: the only reason an ork would install an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat">Ejection Seat</a> is to have an extra rokkit close by, and from their perspective, being in a screaming hunk of metal blazing by at quasi-sonic speeds spitting death and smoke can only be improved by being on fire.

</li><li> Ork Deff Dreads are the orky equivalent of the aforementioned Dreadnoughts, with mostly the same idea behind them. The main difference between the two is that orkz will fight each other for the chance to be installed into one, since it'll let them be huge and powerful. They usually realize, after everything is said and done, that the main drawback of being permanently wired into an enclosed metal can is being permanently wired into a enclosed metal can. This usually makes them go on a rampage until they simmer down to a normal orky mood (read; psychotically homicidal by human standards).

Here, they're intended to be sealed in for life, requiring the services of a Mek (to hook the grot up to the interfaces) and a Dok (to hook up the life-support system). Obviously, the grots aren't made aware of their fate, but once they figure it out, the joys of finally being bigger than the orks (and indeed, most of their enemies) means they need to be corralled for everyone's safety.

Imperial pilots (unlike their Rebel counterparts) wear spacesuits, so very simple ejection seats would let them survive their fighters being destroyed; but does the Empire provide them? Either way of thinking, "expensive pilots, cheap fighters" or "disposable fighters for disposable pilots", would be in-character for the Empire.
<ul><li> Some of the older videogames make it clear that ejection seats are normally provided. Since most fights happen within Imperial space and with superior resources, pilots are supposed to eject if necessary, to be picked up after the fight is over.
</li><li> The various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> sources show that it varies whether TIE Fighters have ejection seats. Originally they all lacked them, as the designers went to extremes to reduce weight for increased speed and agility. Eventually it became common to add ejection seats, as this didn't actually add much weight, the relatively spacious spherical cockpit gave plenty of room to do so, and just a slight improvement to the engines would offset the added weight.

<ul><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> plane crews did not have parachutes (usually). Some officers considered that the crew should not be allowed to leave the plane, as that would be cowardice. It was also thought at the time that if a pilot had a parachute, he would jump from the plane when hit rather than trying to save the aircraft. That being said, planes didn't always come with harnesses either, although they did have seatbelts (for most part). During the course of the war the German air services did introduce parachutes, which saved the lives of some of their airmen, including Hermann Goering and Ernst Udet. However, as parachute technology was in its infancy (at the time all openings were static line deployments, i.e. the ripcord was permanently attached to the plane), using a parachute was still a risky operation.
<ul><li> Introducing the parachute actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotThinkThisThrough">had an inverse effect</a>: the pilots were eager to take more risks and fight more bravely as they now had a means of escape and rescue. In psychology, this is known as Risk Homeostasis (Peltzman's Law).
</li><li> Averted for the crews of World War I observation balloons, which soon were issued parachutes. Here the usual practice was for the observers to jump as soon as an enemy aircraft approached while the ground crew tried to pull the deflating hydrogen balloon to the ground as fast as it could.
</li></ul></li><li> Japanese pilots in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> were not issued parachutes as standard (though they were available to anyone who asked) until 1944, when the air war was waged over the Japanese home islands and any parachuting airmen would be quickly rescued. Unlike the Allies, Japan also never had a dedicated search-and-rescue service for downed airmen. Even if a pilot had successfully bailed out, he was on his own, wherever he ended up.
<ul><li> The Japanese military was (in)famous for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">absolutely callous treatment of its own troops</a> (Soviet commanders at least got similar reputation because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">sheer desperation</a>, but for the Japanese, it was a <em>standard operational practice</em>). Its command wasted the whole prewar cadre of highly trained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilots</a> in fruitless attacks in God-forgotten places such as Rabaul, and only by the very end of the war did Japanese commanders realize that training an experienced pilot is actually a much longer, more expensive, and more difficult process than building them a plane. By then, there was simply not enough resources or enough time to properly train pilots, even if they <em>had</em> considered them irreplaceable.
</li><li> Even the ships got in on this. In the Imperial Japanese Navy, the more important a ship was the worse its safety features were. At the extreme end of the spectrum was the <em>Yamato</em> class which had <em>no</em> life boats or rafts. She had a very limited supply of life vests and they were only intended to be used during storms in case of a "man overboard" scenario, not if the ship actually sank. The issue was further compounded by the way the IJN handled firefighting duties: ships had personnel who were assigned to firefighting teams and they were the ones expected to deal with fires aboard ship. Other crew members were not given firefighting training and expected to continue performing their normal duties in the event of a fire. By contrast, the American Navy's stance on the subject was to give basic firefighting training to all crew members and treated firefighting duty as the responsibility of everyone, whether they were assigned to a firefighting team or not.
</li></ul></li><li> The LaGG-3, a Red Air Force fighter which the Soviet airmen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor">said stood for</a> <em>LAkirovannyi Garantirovannyi Grob</em> (Lacquered Guaranteed Coffin). It was of plywood construction and had substandard flying properties, largely from its heavy airframe and anemic engine (a common problem for most Soviet fighters of WWII). Later, when a new, more powerful engine and other improvements were installed late in the war, it evolved into the seminal (and astonishingly deadly) La-5 and then La-7, an aircraft of choice for the best Allied ace, Ivan Kozhedub.
</li><li> A number of World War II vehicles acquired this reputation:
<ul><li> Italian tanks were literally referred to by their crews as "self-propelled coffins" due to their poor armor and poor hatch placement; they were easily knocked out and difficult to bail out of.
</li><li> Shermans earned a number of derogatory nicknames (most notably "The Tommycooker", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackHumor">after a WWI portable field stove</a>) for their propensity to catch fire, leaving the crew with only seconds to get out of the tank after a penetrating hit. This was due to both the fact that early versions of the M4 didn't have water jackets for the ammo storage and fuel tanks, and that British crews using lend-leased tanks tended to use them like their own "cruiser" tanks: they haphazardly stuffed tons of extra ammo AND fuel into their tanks wherever it would fit. They increased this way both the range and ammunition capacity, but also increased the odds of it getting set off when taking a hit.
</li><li> On the positive side if a Sherman was was hit, it was relatively easy to escape. The Soviet equivalent, T-34, was notoriously cramped and unergonomic, and difficult to escape. It is estimated some 85% of the Sherman tankers whose tank was hit were able to escape, whilst only 18% of T-34 tankers could. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidNotThinkThisThrough">Having the entry hatch on glacis</a> (in the middle of the inclined frontal armour) certainly did not increase the odds of survival.
</li><li> Some early versions of both German and Russian tanks did not have a hatch for the radioman, forcing him to try and escape via the driver's hatch. If the tank caught fire, this usually resulted in the radioman's death.
</li><li> Some versions of the Sherman did not have a hatch for the loader because it compromised the structural integrity of the turret. This was wildly unpopular and was rectified in the next version.
</li><li> German U-Boats were dubbed "iron coffins" by some. If a sub was sunk, there was no chance of survival for the crew, and they would be entombed in the hull at the bottom of the sea, hence the name. Even if the crewmen somehow managed to get out of the U-Boat before it was completely submerged, if any of the electric cell banks necessary for underwater operation were breached the battery acid inside would render the nearby water toxic enough that anyone would be as a corpse by the time they could be plucked out of the waves.
<ul><li> Late in the war, when Germany could no longer field an effective submarine fleet, the Navy created the <em>Neger</em>, a torpedo-carrying one-man submersible. It was a good idea on paper, the small size and low profile of the craft made them perfect for sneak attacks. Unfortunately, the Neger leaked like a sieve, was difficult to steer, aiming the torpedo was almost impossible, and the boat had a nasty tendency to get stuck to a fired torpedo such that both the craft and the torpedo ends up plowing into the target. The Neger was so unsuccessful as a weapon that the Allies never realized it existed.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uzhz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0uzhz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uzhz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">'Neger', by the way, means 'negro'. It was a pun on designer's name, 'Mohr', meaning "blackmoor".</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The modern Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks">BMP series of IFVs</a> have a darkly humorous backronym, "Bratskaya Mogila Pehoty" (Rus. "Common Grave of the Infantry"). The interior is cramped, forcing troopers to squat with their knees close to their chest; this of course, made it more difficult to quickly exit the vehicle, even under normal conditions. What made things worse was that passengers sat with their backs facing the centre of the vehicle, where the <em>main fuel storage tanks</em> were located. One direct hit by anything that wasn't an infantry firearm could easily penetrate the BMP's thin side armour and turn the entire compartment into a fireball. Additionally, the rear door also functioned as secondary fuel tanks; while these were supposed to be left empty in combat operations, a BMP caught in an ambush with fuel in its doors could easily find itself on fire due to a hit on the door allowing fuel to leak inside the crew compartment. While these problem were fixed with the newer BMP-3 model, Russian soldiers participating in the Chechen Wars decided to take their chances riding on top of the vehicle, rather than inside it.
<ul><li> To be fair, this is a common problem for most light APC types, especially those designed to be amphibious and air portable. While many modern Western IFVs are better protected, they are also too heavy to be amphibious or carried by light transport aircraft.
</li><li> Russian armor traditionally was always designed for the large, WWII-style conflict where the most pressing concern was NBC protection, so its mine resistance wasn't anything to write home about  APCs were envisioned to be advancing behind the tank columns, equipped with the mine trawls and interspersed with the combat engineering vehicles that would dig up or detonate the mines. So when most conflicts fought by the Soviet and then Russian Army since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietInvasionOfAfghanistan">Afghanistan</a> turned out to be relatively low-intensity counter-insurgency warfare, where the anti-tank mines and IEDs were used by everyone and their little dog too, but the mine trawls and forward engineering recon proved impractical for each and every column, only for the largest and most important ones, up to forcing the logistics to switch into convoy mode, sitting <em>inside</em> the vehicle was seen as more dangerous than on top of it (it also gave the soldiers better field of view to try to notice any possible ambush). Only by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTens">The New '10s</a> did the Russian military have the time and money to develop their own MRAP vehicles.
</li><li> For that matter, the older BTR-40 and BTR-152 armored personnel carriers also acquired a similar reputation and nickname in the Middle East. Up until recently, these vehicles were fairly common in Arab service; several of them ended up being captured by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IsraelisWithInfraredMissiles">Israel Defence Force</a>, which made use of them as well. Israeli troopers gave the vehicles a backronym in Hebrew: "Bo Tizrok Rimon" ("Come, throw a grenade"), due to their invitingly-open tops. It didn't help that the sides of the vehicle effectively boxed the occupants in.
</li><li> Finnish army conscripts refer to the BTR as <em>Sukellusvene</em> ("Submarine"), not only because its hull resembles one, but due to an accident at Taipalsaari in 1991, where a BTR-60 crossing a lake on light wind took water in and sank, killing seven conscripts.
</li><li> Technical note: the requirement to make the blasted thing amphibious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">came in fairly late in the design process</a>, so the best the designers could do without restarting everything from scratch was to stick in a powerful bilge pump and hope for the best. Yes, the BTR-60 <em>could</em> float  but barely, and only so long as its bilge pump was working, as it leaked like a sieve  and, note, it was in <em>normal</em> operation. If the pump failed, it would promptly take in water and sink.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Heemeyer#Bulldozer_modification">Killdozer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was used in a destructive rampage when a zoning dispute boiled over. After entering, the operator of the makeshift armoured bulldozer used a remote controlled crane to lower a concrete block around the cockpit, sealing himself in. It would've been theoretically possible to remove it by any crane (as it was eventually done, in fact), but Heemeyer just already decided to commit suicide at that point.
</li><li> The Handley Page Victor strategic bomber had the crew hatch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidntThinkThisThrough">immediately ahead</a> of the jet turbine. Attempting to bail out would result in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurbineBlender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurbineBlender">crew salsa</a>.
</li><li> While the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter had an ejection seat, the ejection seats were often too weak to lift the pilot clear of the <em>gigantic</em> tail fin. Early versions of the plane had an ejection seat that ejected <em>downwards</em>, but that would create obvious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingInHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingInHot">problems when landing</a>. Given that the Starfighter also had a well-earned reputation for being difficult to fly (in West Germany, for example, they had sarcastic names like <em>Erdnagel</em> ("tent peg"), <em>Sargfighter</em> ("coffin fighter"), <em>Witwenmacher</em> (widowmaker) or <em>Selbstmordrohr</em> ("suicide tube") and as it was said that the best way to acquire one was to buy a random plot of land and wait for one to fall from the sky), this was a major problem.
</li><li> Issues with getting <em>away</em> from the plane after bailing out (as opposed to getting hit by the tail or wing at high speed) were of course the reason for the development of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EjectionSeat">Ejection Seat</a>, particularly once jets arrived on the scene. Many airmen throughout history attempted to bail out of crippled planes only to suffer such a fate before that development.
</li><li> Flying Crematorium: Born out of desperation during the final years of World War 2, the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet was an emergency rocket-powered air defense fighter that barely had enough fuel and ammunition for a very brief sortie against an incoming formation of bombers. The one detail that makes it an Armored Coffin is the fact that it had to use a landing skid to "crash softly" on a runway since it <em>had no landing gear or brakes</em> (for takeoff it used wheels which were dropped off upon gaining air). A very bad idea as the Komet's fuel tank was highly susceptible to leaking from a hard impact and contained two types of hypergolic (A.K.A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfExplodium">very volatile</a>) propellants that would ignite when combined, <em>without</em> any external source of ignition. This meant that the Me 163 would <em>literally</em> turn into a Komet if it landed hard enough for the fuel to 'slosh' together and spontaneously combust. Ejecting any remaining fuel before landing was recommended.
<ul><li> Even worse, one of those two substances was potently acidic, which meant it needed to be held in a glass container. In turn, this was very easy to rupture if the landing was anything but smooth. Or even if the <em>takeoff</em> was anything but smooth - at the point the Komet was used even flat runways were in short supply, so they would often have to take off from the same bumpy, rocky fields they were meant to land on, which often meant the tires dropped free during takeoff would bounce <em>higher</em> than the altitude they were dropped from, promptly smashing into the Komet and rupturing the fuel tanks.
<ul><li> It would have been less of an issue, because the entire amount of fuel was to be spent gaining altitude, then the Komet would glide to attack and glide back home to crashland. The Komet had ridiculously good gliding characteristic for that manner. Still, the volatile fuels were an issue, to the point where tanking either one of them was made separate, and after one, the other had to wait for the fuel tanker to leave the area entirely before the other fuel was filled in. Before that, rigorous washing with water had to be performed. And while one of the fuels was corrosive, the other would burn after coming in contact with organic tissue, and you were pretty much surrounded in fuel tanks. Pick your poison.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mitsubishi J8M/Ki-200 was a success or failure, depending on your point-of-view. It was a highly unsafe aircraft to land, takeoff, or even refuel due to having all of the dangerous flaws of the Me 163. But the Japanese, with their 'Kamikaze mentality', saw these flaws as bonuses and considered the Rocket-powered Fighter to be a great suicide aircraft: Make one or two firing passes and then go in for a ramming attack. Thankfully for both Allies and Japanese, the Ki-200 was too late to see service and the only casualty it claimed was an unlucky test pilot who crash-landed the aircraft and caused it to spontaneously burst into flames which, ironically, fits the 'Komet' name that the aircraft was based on.
</li></ul></li><li> Being a Ball Turret Gunner meant this trope applied. Most of the crew of the B-17 got parachutes. The ball turret gunner didn't, as there was not enough room in the turret to wear one. Statistically speaking, the ball turret gunner was just as likely to die as any other member of the crew (having the same amount of armor protection, which is to say none at all), but being suspended in a cramped glass ball beneath the plane left one feeling particularly vulnerable. Additionally, if the motors that controlled the turret were damaged during combat, this could prevent the gunner from being able to exit the turret as it could only be opened when properly aligned with its access hatch. And if the plane's landing gear were also damaged, that would mean the plane was forced to perform a belly landing that would assuredly kill the gunner. There is more than one instance where this did indeed happen. This was the main reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison">Harry Harrison</a>, having served (and survived) a full tour of duty in this very position, came to hate all things military with a passion. Which is where all the snark and ridicule in his writing comes from.
</li><li> The Avro Lancaster heavy bomber would fit this trope as well as it was notoriously difficult to escape. Compared to Handley Page Halifax and Short Stirling, Lancaster crews suffered greatest relative losses of all RAF heavies.
</li><li> While the RAF's Avro Vulcan did have ejection seats, these were only for the two pilots; the rest of the five man crew had no such luck and were expected to try to jump out manually via the plane's hatches. Interestingly enough, the original prototypes of this had it worse, with only one pilot having an ejection seat.
</li><li> The Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley performed the first successful underwater attack in naval warfare history that sank the USS Housatonic. Unfortunately, the H.L. Hunley was itself lost after the attack due to the spar torpedo getting stuck in the hull of the sinking Housatonic which dragged the submarine down with it. Many years later, a diving expedition discovered and raised the H.L. Hunley from the water with the skeletons of the crew still at their stations.
<ul><li> Following the success of the H.L. Hunley was the David-class Torpedo Boats which were derisively called "David Cigars" due to their hull shape. Only a few were produced and they had no other weapon besides a single spar torpedo, making them vulnerable to the same problem that sunk the H.L. Hunley.
</li></ul></li><li> The Douglas A3D Skywarrior, a carrier based jet bomber designed as a nuclear strike aircraft, received a morbid take on its designation of "A3D": All Three Dead. The aircraft had a crew of three in a cockpit with no ejection seats and a single exit hatch under the nose<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1466f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1466f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1466f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This seemingly-insane lack of safety was due to the extreme difficulty in making such a large jet capable of operating on aircraft carriers with early 1950s technology. The closely related Air Force version, the B-66 Destroyer, had ejection seats from the start because it operated only on prepared runways and didn't need to keep weight down. The assumption with the A3D was that <em>most</em> incidents where the crew would need to bail out would occur at high altitude and thus simply dropping out of the hatch with a parachute would be feasible, and any low-altitude incidents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">were written off as acceptable losses</a>.</span>; should the aircraft go into the water, none of the crew would be able to escape. This coupled with the difficulty of flying the aircraft around the carrier led to a bad reputation.
