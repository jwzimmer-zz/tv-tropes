</p><p>When the Ending Changes Everything, it calls into question exactly how much of what you've seen was actually real or how to interpret what you have seen so far. A charitable director (or one who wants to show off how clever the script is) might give you a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity">Once More, with Clarity!</a> montage to help you work it out. One thing that is for certain, it creates a very different experience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">when you revisit the story</a>.
</p><p>There are various associated tropes used in achieving this:
</p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, when what we see is a deception on their part, possibly exaggerated due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RashomonStyle">"Rashomon"-Style</a>;

May be connected to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">Kansas City Shuffle</a> by one of the characters;
</li><li> Some specific tropes like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoSurprise">Tomato Surprise</a>.

</p><p>An associated term is "Paraprosdokian", where the ending of sentence or phrase changes causes the latener to reframe the meaning of the previous statement(s). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> has <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraprosdokian">more details and examples<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AnotherNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AnotherNote">Another Note</a></em>. Naomi Misora is conscripted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">L</a> to solve a series of murders in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LosAngeles">Los Angeles</a>. She's joined in her investigation by a mysterious young man with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeCesare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeCesare">messy hair, white skin and bags under his eyes</a> using the pseudonym "Ryuzaki" - must be L, right? The ending reveals the man is actually the murderer, Beyond Birthday, who is obsessed with L and modeled his appearance on him. This leads to a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> considering Naomi's interactions with him throughout the book.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em> begins with Tsukiko Sagi being attacked by a mysterious, baseball-bat-wielding assailant. The attacker, Shonen Bat, then begins to strike various other victims. Turns out that the first attack was faked by Tsukiko herself in order to relieve some of the pressure she was put under on her job. Unfortunately, Shonen Bat spread like a particularly violent meme, and it has a life of its own now...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PantyAndStockingWithGarterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking with Garterbelt</a></em>: "I'm a demon." That's Stocking, Panty's sister. After she returned from Heaven. Who then promptly slices Panty up into 666 pieces. Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> wasn't slain by the duo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GroundControlToPsychoelectricGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GroundControlToPsychoelectricGirl">Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl</a></em>: The last episode of the anime caps off with Yashiro (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">the little girl who runs around in an astronaut suit and insists she is an ESPer</a>) saving Makoto's life by having him move back the EXACT number of steps required to not die from a meteorite and disappearing right after. Immediately prior to this, she had said she would prove her abilities. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Incredibly convenient coincidence</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">she was telling the truth about her abilities</a>? Since the whole show up 'til that point had broken down the existence of the supernatural as nothing but figments of people's imaginations it threw the whole message in a different direction, becoming more along the lines of "keep an open mind, because you never know" and not actually answering the question of whether or not the supernatural exists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei">Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei</a></em>: Up until the end you might view the series as a random collection of slapstick humor, social critique and a few horror elements, without any overall connection. But the last chapter of the manga (not included in the anime) reveals that the girl named Kafuka Fuura (Pen name) died before the start of the series. Everyone in class has an organ transplant of her, through which she is able to possess anyone at will, take over their body and convince everyone else through some kind of mass hypnosis that she is the girl she once was. That is also the reason why we never see all the girls of the class at once because either the missing girl is Kafuka, because she is not real anymore, or it is the girl Kafuka is possessing at the moment. This seems like an asspull but interestingly there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">hints</a> about this throughout the whole series, which you can pick up while watching but you would never be able to deduce this twist. For example watch/read the bit about Meru-Meru's character again, from the very beginning of the series. Watch Kafuka closely. She is possessing Abiru in that scene, indicated by the bandage on her arm that would otherwise be there for no reason, and the zoom in on her left eye spelling DEATH, which is the eye Abiru has always covered.
</li><li> Initially, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion">Puella Magi Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion</a></em> seems to be the story of how Homura freed her friends from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LotusEaterMachine">Lotus-Eater Machine</a>. But in the ending- right when the main conflict of <em>that</em> story is about to be resolved- Homura seizes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> and traps her in a false universe, transforming into a demon in the process. It's at that point the movie's true plot is revealed: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtagonistJourneyToVillain">to explore the reasons and process by which Homura became a villain</a>. That plot is foreshadowed often in symbolism (and certain seemingly innocuous conversations), but first-time watchers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RewatchBonus">won't</a> anticipate it unless they know exactly what to look for and/or interpret <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Homura</a>'s character a specific way.
</li><li> In the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em>, Kaori's goodbye letter reveals that she was inspired to become a musician by Kousei during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> days, that she had wanted to play music with him ever since she was a little girl, and that she lied about liking Watari in order to get close to Kousei.
</li><li> The short manga <em>Mama Mama</em> by Amano Shunita seems to be a fluffy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">Yuri Genre</a> manga about two women and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies">their children</a>. The very last page reveals that they're actually married neighbors who are cheating on their husbands. It really changes the line "Is this what 'happiness' really feels like?" from being cute to depressing, especially since the woman was crying while saying it.
</li><li> In one chapter of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> Case Files manga, Phoenix gets interviewed by a female reporter, who asks for his help in clearing the name of a woman who had been convicted of killing her boyfriend, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">committed suicide</a> after a year in prison. After Phoenix does so, he gets a picture of the girlfriend... who looks exactly like the reporter he spoke with.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em>Fairy Tail Zero</em>, toward the end, it's revealed that Zera, Mavis' friend and the only other survivor of Red Lizard, is, in fact, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">special illusion that she created, which is only visible to her</a>, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">the real Zera died of her wounds on the day Blue Skull attacked</a>. Its also revealed that the other Fairy Tail founders knew that Zera wasn't real, but kept it secret for Mavis' sake.
</li><li> A similar twist to the above occurs in the Welcome to Fairy Hills side story. With an unpaid request that many dismissed as a prank, the eponymous dormitory's crotchety and abrasive old landlady, Hilda, hires Lucy to do a treasure hunt, insisting that she keep it secret from the tenants. Once Lucy finds the treasure, she calls out to Hilda, but Erza comes over. After Lucy finally tells Erza about the treasure hunt and the person who sent her on it, Erza tells Lucy that Hilda has been dead for six years, which means that Lucy was interacting with a ghost all along.
</li><li> In the Natsu and Asuka side story, Natsu has to do everything Asuka tells him to after losing a sharpshooting challenge against her.

Tashiron drunkenly admits that she has feelings for Ootsuki even though she has a girlfriend, and she and Ootsuki offer to go out again. On the final page, Ootsuki replays a clip from the evening, and reveals that she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">had taken advantage of Tashiron's situation,</a> having learned of Tashiron's unhappy relationship by eavesdropping on her and "playing the cool senior card" to win her over.
</li><li> The oneshot <em>Akuryou</em> is about a girl named Mayu, whose best friend, Nami, claims to be able to see ghosts. In the end, it's revealed that Nami is actually a ghost, or at least an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend">Imaginary Friend</a> only Mayu can see, which causes everything to come off differently. Not only does Mayu's refusal to believe in ghosts come off as a refusal to accept that her best friend is one, but when the bullies write hateful messages in "Nami's" notebook, said messages are presumably intended for Mayu.
</li><li> The plot of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LaidBackCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LaidBackCamp">Laid-Back Camp</a></em> spinoff, "Room Camp," a series of three-minute shorts, involves Nadeshiko going on the Yamanashi Kids' Stamp Rally with Aoi and Aki, filling out a stamp book with stamps from various local landmarks to win a year's worth of Minobu steamed buns. At the end of the series, it turns out that the stamp rally was something the other two girls had made up. Nadeshiko, despite being new to town, actually suspected this for some time.

<ul><li> The final volume of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ScottPilgrim">Scott Pilgrim</a></em> forces the reader to question the validity of the story the previous five told. Gideon Graves revealed to Scott that he has tampered with his memories as Scott's real ones were "boring" and the result is that it forces the reader to re-examine Scott as a character. The earlier volumes have him generally come off as an eccentric, pathetic hipster geek, but this image starts to crack and we get a better idea of why Scott's friends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">dislike him so much</a>. It all builds up to the aforementioned final volume, where we see the innocent way Scott views himself is partially the result of Gideon tampering with his memories; it turns out, in reality, he was a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> to his friends <em>and</em> past girlfriends, and his breakup with Envy was apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreyAndGrayMorality">nowhere near as one-sided as it was made out to be</a>.

</li><li> The very first issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em> had readers shown what appeared to be a team of noble heroes making their big debut. On the final page, they were revealed to be the Masters of Evil in disguise, thus transforming the entire thrust of the comic.

You could easily think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless">Police Are Useless</a>, and that it was just an excuse to send the Ultimates to the action. Things are more complicated than that. Ecstasy has several cops under her influence, including O'Reilly's commanding officer, and she works for Hydra. SHIELD was working on it, but then the Galactus event and the break of SHIELD left the case hanging.
</li><li> The main character in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CinemaPurgatorio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CinemaPurgatorio">Cinema Purgatorio</a></em> is in Hell/Purgatory - that much is obvious. She reveals she killed "Geraldine" for stealing "Richard" away from her. The last issue reveals that Geraldine is her daughter, whom she blamed for driving her husband away.
</li><li> <em>Old Man Quill</em> is a spin-off series of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OldManLogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OldManLogan">Old Man Logan</a>, starred by Peter Quill, of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. In this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a>, Quill must retrive the Ultimate Nullifier to stop the Universal Church of Truth, but keeps whining about the loss of Spartax, until the other Guardians take him out of his stupor and force him to go to Earth to find it. Many issues afterwards, they face the Imperial Guard, who tell him that he can't expect to defeat them all alone. He turns to his fellow Guardians, but they are not there. Instead, he remembers a video of them asking for help, and then dying. Mind tricks? Reality warping? No. If the older comics are read again, it can be noticed that Quill is the <strong>only</strong> character who ever talks or interacts with anyone else (barring interactions between the Guardians themselves), and other characters reporting the events only talk about him and not about a band of aliens.

<ul><li> A nervous man goes to a corner grocery and fumblingly grabs several boxes of cereal as he glances around. When he gets to the front counter, he gives them to the lady, who glances at the boxes, one of which is a box of Trix cereal, and, laughing to herself, says, "Trix? Trix are for kids!" while a scare chord plays. The man leaves his money on the counter and takes off while she's ringing him up. Getting home, he throws away the boxes of Wheaties and Cheerios, going over to his table and pouring the cereal into a bowl before unzipping his head, revealing he's the Trix Rabbit. He grabs a quart of milk, pours it onto the cereal... only for the container to be empty.

<ul><li> To elaborate: This PSA shows a young high school student trying to build up the courage to talk to a girl he's crushing on. We see him leave her a cute note, her friends whisper to her about him, and a generally sweet love story which ends with the boy finally approaching her in the school gym...and that's when the doors open and a student with a gun comes in, ready to open fire. Watching the PSA a second time reveals that the young man was in the background of all of the previous shots, with clues indicating that he was miserable: he's bullied in the hallway and, as a teacher passes by, he mimes "shooting" her with a finger gun. The idea is that people often miss "warning signs" of dangerous behavior, and given that many viewers were surprised by the ending, it certainly proved its point.

Celestia explains how it can trap you in a cage, and when you let ponies down, it can have horrific consequences once they have begun depending on you. She loses her temper with Trixie, despite the unicorn's cowering, and eventually banishes her from her sight, before summoning Shining Armor to ask him if he has begun training others in his spell, only to find he has been slacking off because he trusts that Celestia will keep everyone safe.

However, at the end of the fic, after Diana has been released from the Mercys influence, she and Bruce realise that the illusion contained too many details about Thomas and Martha that Diana couldnt have known for it to just be a product of her mind, such as Thomas always beating Bruce at chess or Marthas favourite perfume, with Bruce reflecting that his parents even sound the same when hes projected into the illusion by Jonn.

In reality, the original Jim had a serious stroke in 1989 that made it too dangerous for him to continue acting as an agent even as a safely-removed observer, and so the Phelps of the film was officially given his name so that the IMF could continue to use Jims reputation, exploiting the fact that most of the people who knew the original Phelps were either retired or dead. Not only does this redeem the memory of the original Jim Phelps, but it also makes the fate of the Phelps in the film even harsher, as he lived his life and even died under the name of another man.

Christopher Robin just laughs and reveals that the only thing that makes a sound like that is Pooh's stomach. After they exit the skull shaped cavern, they notice that the cave looks entirely different than it did when they entered it. Christopher Robin explains that things can seem bigger and scarier when you're alone, or afraid, or someone's hurt. In the following song, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceMoreWithClarity">we get to see what several of the scary locations they had been through really look like.</a> There is also the revelation that Christopher Robin had just gone to school for viewers who are not literate enough know what S C H O O L actually spells.

A police prisoner, Verbal Kint, is being interrogated about a ship explosion the previous night. His interrogator Agent Kujan believes that the explosion was caused by Dean Keaton, a crooked cop, but Kint tells how a diabolical mastermind called Keyser Soze was behind it all. Eventually, Kint relents under Kujan's pressure and admits that Keaton was Keyser Soze all along. Just after Kint is released from custody, however, Kujan realizes that Kint has been spinning a gigantic lie using objects around the office as inspiration. It's suggested that it was Kint himself who is Keyser Soze and Kint was simply playing a role the whole time. This is all foreshadowed in the beginning, when Kujan states that cops almost always find what they expect to find. Kujan expected Kint to be a weak patsy protecting Keaton, so that's the role Kint played.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MatchstickMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MatchstickMen">Matchstick Men</a></em>. Obviously, most of the film is a con. But when did it start? How much of it was planned, how much improvised? And just how much affection do Frank and "Angela" have for Roy? The film suggests answers for some of those questions, but some of them we just have to guess about.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FightClub">Fight Club</a></em>: The guy he met on the plane who seemed to be the brains behind everything that happened turned out to be the main character's split personality, putting into question everything that happened during the whole movie.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento">Memento</a></em> ends this way, when it's revealed that Leonard killed his wife's rapist before any of the events of the movie, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiaDanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiaDanger">not remembering this</a>, has been killing criminals with similar names. The man he kills at the start of the film (actually the end of the timeline) is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop">Dirty Cop</a> inducing him to do this, toward whom he himself had planted hints. Raising even more questions, the dirty cop claims that the actual rapist did not kill Leonard's wife, but she committed suicide because she couldn't deal with Leonard's amnesia. His memory of "Sammy Jankis" is actually a twisted version of his own story that he conditioned himself to remember. However, since he <em>is</em> a dirty cop, it's unclear whether he's actually telling the truth or just trying to keep Leonard busy until he loses his memory again.
</li><li> The Jet Li movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hero">Hero</a></em> uses this trope by taking place almost entirely during an audience with the emperor during which the main character tells his story to the emperor in long flashbacks, after which the emperor points out a flaw in the claims. Based on the lies he discovered, the emperor tells the story again with some changes of what he thinks really happened. And with his lie exposed, the nameless hero then confesses the actual events and retelling the story a third time. And then everything changes again when he reveals that he never actually intended to kill the emperor since he realized the folly of the insurrection on his way to the palace and only wanted to explain his reasons before accepting his punishment for participating in a conspiracy. He also demonstrates that he <em>could</em> have killed the emperor at any point, after getting within 10 paces of him, even using his technique but turning his blade at the last moment.
</li><li> Likewise the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfFlyingDaggers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfFlyingDaggers">House of Flying Daggers</a></em>. In its final half hour, each individual character reveals each other individual character, all of them in roles they hadn't seemed to fill for most of the movie. The only character, amusingly, who's been somewhat honest the whole way through, is the one who's supposed to be the one conning others.
</li><li> The 2006 film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Irresistible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Irresistible">Irresistible</a></em>: You don't know if Mara (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilyBlunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilyBlunt">Emily Blunt</a>) was in fact Sophie's (Susan Sarandon) prodigal daughter, or if she just stole the identity of her best friend Kate (who bears a closer resemblance to Sophie and her other daughters).
</li><li> The 2003 French/American horror film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighTension">High Tension</a></em> (known as <em>Switchblade Romance</em> in the UK) uses this to disturbing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> effect. Marie is a severely unreliable narrator, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoLesbian">Psycho Lesbian</a>, and the killer. This WAS somewhat foreshadowed in the beginning (the dream about Marie chasing herself, with footage from later in the movie; Marie being mentioned as never having a boyfriend) but this is in the realm of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a>; to most people it seems like a totally random and jarring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">Ass Pull</a> bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a>, due to several scenes that make no sense if she and the killer are the same person.
</li><li> The Korean film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATaleOfTwoSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ATaleOfTwoSisters">A Tale of Two Sisters</a></em> featured both an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll">Real After All</a>, leaving the viewer to wonder how much was truly supernatural, and how much was merely the delusions of the insane protagonist.
</li><li> Another Korean film, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodyReunion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BloodyReunion">Bloody Reunion</a></em>, ends when we find out that the narrator is the murderer, and she made up the entire story, and all the bad things in the flashbacks actually happened to her, not the other guests.
</li><li> Korean horror <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeadFriend">Dead Friend</a></em> (also known as <em>The Ghost</em>) is played out as a generic horror flick, until the final scene where it is revealed the ghost who has been killing off Ji-won's (the main character's) friends IS in fact Ji-won. In a flashback it is shown that Ji-won had inadvertently caused the death of a girl before the movie began. The audience is led to believe this girl is the ghost and that she wants revenge. However, it is later revealed that she and Ji-won switched bodies just before the girl died, so the girl is actually the protagonist we have been following throughout the movie and Ji-won is the ghost.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WildThings">Wild Things</a></em>: Pretty much all the characters are revealed in a series of twists to be allied with one another, then revealed in another series of twists to be secretly betraying one another. Even when the movie is over, the writers throw in several more twists during the closing credits just for fun.
</li><li> David Mamet is well known for his big twists, which call into question large chunks of the previous plot:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HouseOfGames">House of Games</a></em>, the heroine realizes that none of the cons in which she participated were real. They were all one giant con on <em>her.</em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StateAndMain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StateAndMain">State and Main</a></em>, the main character perjures himself in court and instantly regrets it. It turns out that the whole court scene was just a play designed by the local love interest to give him a chance to rethink his choice before the real court case begins. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> parodied this scene, and Lisa admits that it's almost insultingly far-fetched.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpanishPrisoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpanishPrisoner">The Spanish Prisoner</a></em>, Mamet returned to the topic of conmen. It turns out that most of what happened in the first half of the movie was an elaborate con, but even after the hero thinks the con is over, it's still going.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Redbelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Redbelt">Redbelt</a></em> tries this, though not as well as previous films. After suddenly being snubbed and ripped off by some Hollywood types, the main character desperately tries to figure out what's going on. He finally discovers that it's all about a laughably impossible scheme to fix <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> matches.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer">Primer</a></em>: The second act of the film involves the use of very limited <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a>; in the third act Abe learns that his friend Aaron has <em>already</em> used the time machine to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast">change the past.</a> So during the entire aforementioned second act, Aaron had actually been Aaron-from-a-week-in-the-future, manipulating current events for his own ends.
</li><li> The remake <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall2012">Total Recall (2012)</a></em> drops the ambiguity and sticks with a happy ending, but the Extended Cut of the remake puts some of the ambiguity back in. The message that Quaid finds in Hauser's apartment shows Quaid/Hauser portrayed by Ethan Hawke instead of Colin Farrell, and the tattoo he received at Rekall is missing at the end.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LuckyNumberSlevin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LuckyNumberSlevin">Lucky Number Slevin</a></em>, in which it's revealed that the eponymous apparent patsy has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansasCityShuffle">planned out all the film's events thus far</a>, working with the hitman who'd apparently been using him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningBothSides" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningBothSides">play both ends against the middle</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterLife">After.Life</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson">Liam Neeson</a> plays a mortician named Elliot who claims to have the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp">speak to the dead</a>. Throughout the movie, he talks to the main character (who is dead) in hopes of getting her to move on with her life. It turns out in the end that he was lying the whole time and that the main character was alive the whole time. However, there have been foreshadowing for <em>both</em> options on whether he was lying or not. With lots of those moments pointing towards the former. And one large hint that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">has been doing it for a long time</a>.
</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShutterIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShutterIsland">Shutter Island</a></em>, we learn at the end that the protagonist isn't a cop anymore; just a delusional mental patient. Everyone he's met, including his partner, has been playing along with this delusion in the hope that it'll let him get over his trauma and the apparent conspiracy was all in his mind. Not only that, but he killed his wife after she killed their children; it was this incident that caused his psychotic break and he's been blocking it out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unknown2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unknown2011">Unknown (2011)</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LiamNeeson">Liam Neeson</a> plays Dr. Martin Harris, a scientist who came to Berlin with his wife for a biotechnology conference. He gets in a car accident, wakes up in the hospital after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepForDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsleepForDays">four-day coma</a> and finds that another man has completely taken over his life. Harris' wife believes the other man, who seems to know everything Harris knows, is her husband. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> is that Harris is a deep-cover assassin who was on a mission to kill someone at the conference, but now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">believes his own cover story</a> as a result of the brain damage he suffered in the car accident: Harris' "wife" is actually his partner, and the other man was a backup assassin who took over the role of "Dr. Harris" when the protagonist disappeared.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unknown2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unknown2006">Unknown (2006)</a></em>, the film's conclusion reveals that James Caviezel's character is actually an undercover cop, who had infiltrated the kidnapping ring and was about to bust them when a toxic gas rendered both kidnappers and kidnappees unconscious and amnesiac. And then the <em>very</em> last scene twists the twist, by revealing that he'd also been sleeping with the wife of the kidnapped millionaire, and had <em>incited</em> the rest of the criminal gang to abduct the man so he could murder him and set the gang up to take the fall.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PsychoBeachParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PsychoBeachParty">Psycho Beach Party</a></em> it turns out it was all a dream in the main character's mind, that later got turned into a film where the main character then goes to kill some of the audience... so arguably you have to wonder when she got put away, who actually died, who was the actual murderer... and it raises so many questions.
</li><li> Used to creative effect in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4meeZifCVro">Lovefield<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>,</em> a short film by Mathieu Ratthe. In the middle of a secluded cornfield, a man appears to be finishing killing a woman offscreen. Hurrying back to his truck, he grabs a towel and the audience presumes he's trying to cover up the body and perhaps dispose it in some way. Then just at the end, the man says "It's a boy," and a newborn baby appears in view. The woman who sounded like she was dying was in fact in the midst of delivering a child and the blood was just the afterbirth.
</li><li> Near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Identity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Identity">Identity</a></em>, it's revealed that none of the people at the motel are real. They are only the figments of Malcolm Rivers's imagination, each of them a separate personality of his mind.
</li><li> Excessively used in the American remake of the horror movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilentHouse">Silent House</a></em>, after being chased around the house by a mysterious burly man, and her father and uncle get attacked by the man and taken away, she finds out from a woman who claims to be her child hood friend that her father and uncle used her and the main character in child pornography and that the mysterious woman was the killer the whole time. Then it turns out the woman doesn't exist and that the main character was the killer. THEN, after killing her unrepentant father and sparing her repentant uncle, it turns out neither of them exist. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Maybe?</a>
</li><li> The 2003 version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Willard">Willard</a></em>. The finale goes from the title character screaming while killing his turncoat rat to him screaming in an insane asylum. He has bite marks on his face, but it's not clear if anything else in the movie actually happened or if he simply has an obsession with rats, and his damaged mind created a fictional history for his wounds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepawayCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepawayCamp">Sleepaway Camp</a></em>, it's obvious early in the story that Angela is the killer. The <em>real</em> twist is that "Angela" <em>isn't</em> Angela. The real Angela died in the boat accident at the start of the film. "Angela" is actually Peter, Angela's brother, who was taken in by their insane aunt and raised as "the daughter [she] always wanted." Although this is actually hinted a few times during the movie (starting with the fact that we're never actually shown which sibling survived), most viewers would've blown off a lot of the clues as simply part of Angela's odd nature.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrestige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrestige">The Prestige</a></em> ends with a reveal that Christian Bale's character is actually a pair of twins, concealing this in order to perform magic tricks. Specifically, this calls into question which of the twins actually killed the wife in the beginning scene, whether it was truly an accident (and the possibility that he was telling the truth when he said he didn't know), and which one is dying for the crime, rightly or wrongly. It does, however, explain his odd behavior towards his wife. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> and watching the dialogue again seems to imply that the twin who killed the wife is also the one who dies at the end. However, it's the other twin who said he didn't know, and while this is likely true, it raises even more questions.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwistEnding">Twist Ending</a> reveals that both the storyteller and his companion are inmates in an insane asylum, and the whole story has been a mad justification fantasy that presents its teller as the blameless hero and his doctor as a diabolical, motiveless tormentor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSkeletonKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSkeletonKey">The Skeleton Key</a></em> builds everything up to make it look like Violet is planning to sacrifice Ben and Caroline in a ritual to give her immortality. It turns out that this is only half right. The ritual is a transfer, not a sacrifice, and "Violet" and her husband are actually two former slaves named Mama Cecil and Papa Justify, who have been using the ritual to swap bodies with younger people. "Ben"'s fear of "his" wife is because he's actually the family's young lawyer - Papa Justify moved from the Ben body to the lawyer's before the movie began, and the lawyer in the Ben body is understandably traumatized and trying to warn Caroline. The ending also changes the way a lot of seemingly trivial comments come across, such as Violet complaining that the nurse sent to look after Ben is not black (Mama Cecil comments at the end of the movie that she'd wanted to move into the body of a black girl) and asking if Caroline had any tattoos to see if her body was acceptable. It also adds a sinister layer to the romance between the lawyer and Caroline, since it's revealed that Papa Justify was only doing it so that he and Mama Cecil could continue to live as a married couple in their new bodies, without anyone suspecting something is off.

Seriously. Or you could argue that the party at the end is a dying hallucination as he commits suicide for <em>actually</em> killing his brother. Either way, nearly everything in the movie is proven to be a staged incident.

There's even a moment where her boyfriend comes into her room in the dead of night after failing to show up at the designated meeting spot earlier. She tries to hug him and realizes that his spine is broken. He then, with his body twisted, tries to walk to her, as she runs away screaming. Finally, her stepmother, whom she and her sister Alex think is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackWidow">Black Widow</a>, appears to drug Anna and threaten to put her back into the mental hospital. Anna wakes to to find the stepmother's body in the dumpster with Alex holding the knife. Their father arrives, and, horrified, reveals that Alex died along with their mother before the start of the film. Anna is the one who accidentally caused the explosion that killed them (after seeing her father cheat with the nurse) and went insane, imagining Alex to be alive and her mother and boyfriend's ghosts haunting her. She was also the one who pushed her boyfriend off the cliff but blocked it out. The only thing no one can figure out is why Anna thought that the stepmother was a black widow. The final scene reveals that one of her friends in the mental hospital was the real black widow.
<ul><li> Anna thinks she is a black widow because the stepmother wasn't using her real name. This was only because she was on the run from an abusive boyfriend and had to change her name to elude him, something tragically common in many cases of Domestic Abuse.

</li><li> Each of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Saw">Saw</a></em> movies ends on a twist that is at least somewhat like this:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawI">Saw I</a></em>: The man lying "dead" in the middle of the room was John Kramer, the Jigsaw killer who had orchestrated the traps. He was alive the whole time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawII">Saw II</a></em>: The "live" feed of the traps that the detectives are watching was actually pre-recorded, and Daniel, Eric's son, was in a safe in that room the whole time. Also, Amanda was working for John Kramer, acting as his disciple to continue the Jigsaw legacy after he dies, with the events of the film having been a trap she designed for Eric that he failed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIII">Saw III</a></em>: The entire film was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> that John Kramer had designed for Amanda, feeling that she had lost sight of his ideals and was just murdering people out of hatred by creating inescapable traps.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawIV">Saw IV</a></em>: Hoffman was another of John Kramer's accomplices, and continues his legacy after John and Amanda are dead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawV">Saw V</a></em>: Hoffman frames Strahm for the Jigsaw murders he committed before killing him, getting away scot-free.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SawVI">Saw VI</a></em>: In his will, John Kramer gave his wife Jill five envelopes containing pictures of five people to be "tested", which she gives to Hoffman. The ending reveals that Jill held onto a sixth envelope that contained a picture of Hoffman himself. Jill locks him into a reverse bear trap and leaves him to die; he survives, but gets half a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowGrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlasgowGrin">Glasgow Grin</a> in the process.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Saw3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Saw3D">Saw 3D</a></em>: Dr. Gordon, one of the victims from the first film, has since become yet another of John Kramer's accomplices. He finishes what Jill started by kidnapping Hoffman and leaving him to die in the same basement Gordon was locked up in in the first film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jigsaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jigsaw">Jigsaw</a></em>: The main series of traps is actually a flashback to events ten years prior, and all of the people in it died... save for one. That survivor was Logan, the ostensible protagonist for most of the film, who is revealed to have become an apprentice of Jigsaw's (and now, the man carrying on his legacy) after surviving the trap.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RabidDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RabidDogs">Rabid Dogs</a></em>: The three robbers die but so does Maria. The protagonist then steals their getaway car and money and drives away with his sick child in it. Then it turns out the child is someone he kidnapped and he ends up calling the mother for ransom!
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MNightShyamalan">M. Night Shyamalan</a> is famous for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryTwistEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MandatoryTwistEnding">Mandatory Twist Ending</a>, many of which are designed with this in mind.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSixthSense">The Sixth Sense</a></em>: Crowe is a renowned child psychologist who is shot by a deranged former patient in the opening scene. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> has him meet with Cole who reveals that he can see dead people.

This redefines his entire role in the movie as you realize plot points, like his attempts to communicate with his distant wife, are not as they seem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unbreakable">Unbreakable</a></em>: Elijah mentions part way through the film that he has been researching various local disasters hoping to find someone who survives miraculously unharmed, which included the main character David in a train crash. At the end it's revealed that many of those disasters were orchestrated by him in the hope of finding a superhero, including the original train crash.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheVillage">The Village</a></em>: A gravestone suggests the film takes place in the late 1800's, it's revealed to actually be the modern day and the isolated village was an attempt to live peacefully away from the rest of society.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Split">Split</a></em>: The movie plays its main story relatively straight, although features some relatively unexpected supernatural elements with the character who has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">Split Personality</a>. The ending shows David from <em>Unbreakable</em> watching a news report on the events of the film, which changes the movie as it is also following the rules established by the earlier movie.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLazarusEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLazarusEffect">The Lazarus Effect</a></em>: The ending shows the villain's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">Redemption Equals Death</a> was all a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDream">Dying Dream</a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a>. The villain is alive, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a> is dead. This works well with the film's theme of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">Maybe Magic, Maybe Mundane</a>, as a magical explanation would make a great deal of what we saw accurate anyway, while a mundane explanation would call it into question.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Reincarnation">Reincarnation</a></em>: Nagisa, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalGirl">Final Girl</a>, is straightjacketed in a sanitarium and being taunted by a creepy old lady about being possessed by the murderous Professor Omori; she screams and cries and thrashes...then begins laughing, proving that she <em>is</em> possessed.

For all of his morally questionable actions, Nathan was actually telling the truth about Ava: she actually <em>was</em> faking her attraction to Caleb in order to escape.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WitnessForTheProsecution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WitnessForTheProsecution">Witness for the Prosecution</a></em>, after Leonard is acquitted for murder, Christine reveals that she engineered the critical surprise evidence which is she presented in a perfect disguise and accent to Leonard off for the murder he really did commit. Then Leonard returns all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> to gloat at bamboozling Sir Wilford with Double Jeopardy shielding him from justice.

</li><li> The Indian thriller film <em>Kahaani</em> follows a pregnant woman named Vidya trying to locate her missing husband, and getting caught up in a plot to find <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Milan</a>, a terrorist that attacked a Metro 2 years earlier and looks exactly like her husband. The ending, however, reveals that she was lying the entire time: her real husband, who did not look like Milan, died in the Metro attack, she lost the baby back then as a result, and she was working with an ex-intelligence agent to find and kill Milan.
</li><li> In the 1980 sci-fi musical <em>The Apple</em>: In the very end, Mr. Topps - never mentioned until minutes before he arrives - appears in a Rolls Royce and takes all hippies to heaven or a new planet (or both). This means: 1.) Up to this point, you could interpret this film as an anti-commerce message when Bibi is corrupted by Bugalow's business, but is not necessarily a stand-in for hippy culture. With this ending, the movie completely takes sides in favor of the hippies and portrays them and their love/peace-cause as unambiguously good. 2.) All of Alphie's visions are to be taken literally (Bugalow is not metaphorically the devil but literally, Bibi does not take the forbidden fruit metaphorically but literally, etc.) 3.) Alphie and Bibi are no longer the main characters of the movie but the hippies - not introduced until very late in the film and receiving about zero character development or being spotlighted on their culture - are and get an eschatological meaning. A sequence where Mr. Topps creates the world and Bugalow falls from grace in the beginning of the movie was planned but never filmed.
</li><li> <em>Nightlight</em> seems like just another in a long line of low-budget <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoundFootageFilms">Found Footage Films</a>, and <em>very</em> derivative of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject">The Blair Witch Project</a></em>: a camera's-eye view of teens getting stalked through spooky woods by some faceless, malignant force. It's only the closing shot that reveals there <em>was</em> no camera: we've been seeing everything from the POV of the <em>possessed flashlight</em> one of the teens brought along, which is haunted by the vengeful ghost of her jilted friend who'd committed suicide. So what seemed like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseCamera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseCamera">In-Universe Camera</a> was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpendingDoomPOV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpendingDoomPOV">Impending Doom P.O.V.</a>, a doom she's been hauling along with her.

It's established that one of them is a white collar criminal with a stash of cash and one of them is a serial killer. Roberts' character insists on accompanying Henriksen, using the fact that he "knows what's in his briefcase" as leverage. Every time Roberts sets his sights on a passerby, against Henriksen's pleas, that person winds up dead. In the end, it's revealed that <em>Henriksen</em> is actually the serial killer (with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">briefcase full of knives</a>) and Roberts the white collar criminal.

Eventually, it is proven that another known child murderer was in the area at the time and Eckman is let out of jail. Then it is revealed that Eckman actually was guilty. Then it is revealed that Malinowski <em>knew</em> Eckman was guilty the whole time and deliberately did the investigation to get Eckman released so that he could kill him with his own hands in revenge.
</li><li> The 2008 Chilean film <em>Solos</em> (English title <em>Descendants</em>) looks like a conventional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> movie, albeit told from the novel perspective of a young girl left alone to wander the desolated city. Curiously, the zombies themselves don't seem to pay her or the other roaming children she meets any attention, but the <em>human military</em> seems determined to experiment on or kill them. It's only when you see freakin' <strong>Cthulhu</strong> arise from the ocean to defend the children from their pursuers that you realize it's a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror">Cosmic Horror</a> Apocalypse</em>, not a Zombie one, and the few adults not rendered undead by emergent unnatural forces want to study or kill the kids because they're turning into Deep Ones: adapting to the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>-ruled world.

The reader's point-of-view was the perspective of an AI in the Alternate History's future analyzing past events to learn how it came about. Everything - the titles of the chapters, the structure of the writing (which seems stilted, almost bureaucratic at times), the descriptions of the world - it all plays into it.

At the end, he gets what he deserves. Then it is revealed that the narrator's sister performed at least one of the mysterious acts of cruelty that were blamed on the father, raising the possibility that he may have been an innocent scapegoat of the family's general dysfunction.

Confused? Let's explain: Beatrice turns out to have been the Baudelaires' mother, and she had dated Lemony before marrying the kids' father. Lemony is recording the kids' misadventures partly out of curiosity about his lover's children and also to add their stories to the <em>ASoUE</em> book that records all the lives of those who washed up on the island, including himself.

They don't want any recompense, or so they claim. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>: they simply enjoy being loved for what they look like — beautiful flowers. No alien race has ever done this before.
</li><li> <em>Time and Again</em>: The hero's life's work won't be liked by many humans. Instead they would publish a "revised edition" that insists on Humanity's superiority. Exactly how popular is the original edition? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>: none of the hero's friends are real humans. He's doing what's right, rather than what humans would like, and if he knew that, he may abandon the work. (Note that this novel was published under several names with different endings.)
</li><li> <em>Werewolf Principle</em>: There's no place for the hero on the future Earth. He's going to leave it forever to study new worlds. This entails losing his newly-found love and lonely immortality. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>: she is a similar android who has to leave Earth for the same reason, making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">Bittersweet Ending</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Big Brother</em> by Lionel Shriver, the narrator admits at the end that the second half the of the story never happened. She concocted a story for herself and the reader, where she went to great lengths to rescue her obese brother and help him lose hundreds of pounds that he inevitably regains, showing her efforts and sacrifice to have been futile. In fact, she put him on the plane back to New York and only saw him one more time before he died of obesity-related complications a couple of years later. The story she has told the reader is a desperate attempt to cope with her own guilt and determine if there was anything she could have done to help her brother.

The US does eventually end up militarising it in self-defense against the Russians' attack on the space station it's mounted on. The epilogue has the people who gave Bradley the idea reveal that, contrary to what both the inventors and the audience thought, the orbital microwave laser was the primary purpose after all, with the peaceful power transmission just being a secondary benefit.

Most of the episode was then about the various pitfalls reinforcing why they had such a hard time dating in the first place, with Leonard admitting every scenario for them inside his head ends badly and Penny telling him he overthinks things. The story then jumps back to the first scene in the hallway, most of the episode being a mental debate on if he should ask her out again. Despite the "bad ending" he imagined he decided to do it anyway and the episode ends by contrasting real life with his imagination, proving that his imagined scenario may not be the end outcome.

As weird costumed people start chasing her, others just watch, recording with their phones instead of helping. She meets up with more battle-ready survivors on a quest to stop the signal and gets flashbacks of her past. She sees a fiancé, a daughter, a white teddy bear, and fire for some reason. The group gets to the broadcast headquarters of the signal and fight off some henchmen, climaxing in Victoria shooting a shotgun at one of them. The gun just has confetti. Then the truth is revealed as the "headquarters" turn out to be a stage with an audience behind it. Victoria is chained down to a chair and breaks down crying as her past is played back on a projector: the little girl isn't her daughter; she and her fiancé kidnapped her. The fiance <em>tortured and burned the little girl to death</em> while Victoria recorded things on her phone. The white bear was the girl's, and a vigil-like symbol of the hunt to find her while she was missing. The weird brainwash symbol was the husband's tattoo. He hung himself in prison, but people decided Victoria should be punished to the extent he wasn't. The entire experience was that punishment. The brainwashed people with their phones out were willing tourists seeing a sideshow attraction. At the end, Victoria is taken back to the house where she woke up at the start and has her memory wiped away with a head collar device that has her in screaming pain as it does its work. It's shown that the people in charge of this punishment repeat this whole process every day.
</li><li> In Season 3's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorShutUpAndDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BlackMirrorShutUpAndDance">"Shut Up and Dance"</a>, Kenny, a teenager who downloads a sketchy "malware remover" to reverse some damage his sister did to his laptop, is blackmailed when hackers record him masturbating. He's forced to pair up with Hector, a man being blackmailed for an affair, for a bank robbery. This later escalates to him having to fight a fellow blackmailed person <em>to the death</em> to see who gets the "prize money". In their conversation before the fight, it's revealed that Kenny was masturbating to child porn (as was the man he is to fight). This explains why he had to play along all the way through. Kenny wins the fight, but the hackers still leak everything they have on everyone, and Kenny is taken away by police at the end.

The episode ends on Buffy in the Mental Institution going catatonic. (Joss Whedon claimed this episode was ambiguous, and the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">snaps back</a> in the next episode.)
</li><li> The 100th episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>, "The Lives of Others", has Castle stuck in his apartment with a broken leg, increasingly bored to the point where he ends up spying on the apartment across the street from his loft, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearWindowInvestigation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RearWindowInvestigation">ends up thinking that one of the tenants committed a murder there</a>. Beckett insists that he's only letting his writer's imagination get away with him, and finally decides to visit the apartment to prove Castle wrong, only to be suddenly held at knifepoint by the tenant. Castle, Esposito and Ryan rush to the apartment, knock down the door... and then the lights turn on and everyone shouts "Surprise!" Turns out Beckett organized the whole thing as an elaborate birthday surprise for Castle. Notably this helped explain some seemingly inexplicable moments, such as Alexis giving her dad a pair of binoculars for his birthday and Beckett's rather hamfisted attempt to insert the word "fridge" into a conversation to trigger a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a>.

So in the final episode, it was revealed to be all in the imagination of a supermarket sales assistant! In other words, everything that happened in the revived series was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a>, while leaving the continuity of the original series intact.

<ul><li> "Got Murder?". After finding that a dismembered body belongs to the estranged ex-wife of a man who had been accused of her murder, the investigators discover that that man's daughter is pregnant, and find evidence that he was molesting her. Just as their case starts to look watertight — that he killed his wife when she returned to find him in bed with their daughter — the truth comes out: it's just a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_pregnancy">hysterical pregnancy.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The daughter killed her mom for threatening her fantasy life <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">as the housewife</a>.

</li><li> "Anatomy of a Lye" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">rips off</a> the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chante_Jawan_Mallard">Gregory Biggs case<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the headlines, with a drunk driver hitting a man with his car, then driving to his garage with the victim stuck alive and unable to move in the windshield, where he dies hours later. Meanwhile, the perp continues with his life in order to not raise suspicions, buries the body in a park the night after and doses the car and garage with lye to erase any evidence. Unlike in Biggs' case, the episode ends with the discovery of a suicide note from the victim: he walked in front of the car intending to kill himself. The ending thus makes the whole elaborate scheme of the perp to avoid prosecution pointless <em>and</em> counter-productive, since if he had just taken the man to a hospital, he would have been charged with nothing - not even drunk driving, as it was unrelated to the 'accident'. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> behavior was what made him a murderer.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmptyNest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EmptyNest">Empty Nest</a></em> has Harry seeing a series of patients all named Billy. They get progressively older as the episode goes on. The final patient is a young man about to leave for college who's come for his records. Harry and the college bound man have a brief conversation which includes a mention of past drug use (which another of the patients had issues with). Then the man gives him a book on sexual education (which Harry had given to a pre-teen patient who asked about it) and a Pez dispenser (which Harry had given to a diabetic patient). It's then revealed that all of the patients were the same boy at different points of his life. The last shot is all of the patients leaving Harry's office in single file.

She quickly realizes that there has been a mistake, and tries to hide the fact that she isn't supposed to be there. Eventually, she discovers someone else, Jason, who was also put in The Good Place by mistake. As the series goes on, it focuses on both Eleanor and Jason, living with their respective 'soul mates', Chidi and Tahani. The four of them proceed to get into ridiculous situations and make each others lives miserable, as one would expect from a typical sitcom... Except the season finale reveals that all four of them have been in The Bad Place the entire time, explicitly chosen to torture each other for a thousand years. And Michael, the well-meaning but kinda goofy Architect? <em>He was behind the entire thing.</em> He was getting tired of "classic" tortures like burning in lava pits or swarmed by angry bees and decided to build a fake Good Place so the "prisoners" and their clashing personalities could torture themselves! <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NoExit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NoExit">Hell is other people, indeed...</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Time Travelers" has a surreal story of Ted and Barney dealing with duplicates of themselves in multiple time periods, a girl Ted met years ago showing up along with several potential future versions of how their relationship will turn out, along with a subplot of a Marshall and Robin conflict regarding the name of a new cocktail. It is then revealed that the entire episode was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a>. The duplicates thing never happened and the Marshall and Robin conflict occurred five years ago. Ted was actually sitting in the bar all by himself because his friends were too busy to hang out with him. Future!Ted then talks about how that was such a depressing moment in his life that he says the only thing that he would have wanted to do was run to "The Mother" and be with her 45 days earlier than what really happened.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> it's revealed that the Mother died in 2024 from an unspecified illness after being with Ted for 11 years, having two kids, and loved each other deeply the entire time. In addition we learn that Robin and Barney's marriage lasted only three years and that Barney regressed to his womanizing ways only to get one pregnant and become the father of a little girl, while Robin fell off the radar because of how much it hurt to see Ted and Tracy (the Mother) together, only returning when they got married in 2020. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">In 2030 as Ted wraps up the story</a>, his kids don't buy his reason for telling the story and believe he wants to pursue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryAunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonoraryAunt">"Aunt" Robin</a> again (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCanSeeIt">which they can see every time she comes over to visit</a>).

</li><li> In another episode, Ted and Barney go out to a bar and decide to live like there's no tomorrow. No matter what Ted does, it seems that the Universe approves and the night goes incredibly well for him. The next morning, he finds out that he had been butt-dialing Marshall all night, and much of his night had been captured on Marshall's voicemail. Listening to it again with a clearer head makes Ted realize what a complete and utter jerk he had been.
</li></ul></li><li> Almost every episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle">Hustle</a></em> ends with the revelation that the main characters were in complete control of the situation, even though it seemed that they were completely doomed. The best example was the episode in which <em>they</em> were being conned, which revealed at the end that not only were they aware they were being conned, they had been aware <em>before the episode had even started</em>. Being a show about conmen, very, <em>very</em> occasionally, the exact opposite would happen, and the team would never even realise <em>they</em> were the ones who'd been played.
</li><li> An episode of <em>Los misterios de Laura</em> tells the story of a guy who wakes up after an operation with a girl he's never seen claiming to be his wife. She conveniently needs him to sign some papers to access a very shady security vault at a bank, the girl he claimed to be his real wife is murdered, then the "new" wife tries to get him incapacitated, which would give her automatic access to all those shady accounts... <strong>He</strong> was behind everything, he was truly married to the "unknown" wife and wanted to get <em>her</em> arrested by making it all look like she had been the one pulling off an elaborate rouse.
</li><li> The crime drama <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Motive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Motive">Motive</a></em> tells the audience at the start who the killer is. The episode then shows flashbacks to the events leading up to the murder. The final flashback will often have a twist that reveals the death was different than expected, the motive was not what it was believed and quite often the "victim" was no innocent.
<ul><li> A limo driver appears to have killed a cop for his girlfriend. It turns out the cop was corrupt and he and the woman were scamming the poor guy.
</li><li> One episode makes it appear that a pilot is cheating on his fiancee with another woman and killed her to keep the affair quiet. When he's arrested, he reveals that the victim was someone he sat next to on a flight and began stalking him, inventing their entire "relationship" in her mind. When he confronted her, she attacked him and the killing was self-defense.
</li><li> It looks like a woman killed a call girl for an affair with her husband. Instead, the call girl had realized the woman was running a ponzi scheme and killed to hush it up.
</li><li> An episode appears to be a man murdered by a guy who then kidnaps his daughter. It turns out the killer is the girl's real father and the "victim" is the guy who kidnapped her years before.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrRobot">Mr. Robot</a></em> has two of these:
<ul><li> The ending of season 1 reveals that Mr. Robot is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">split personality</a> of Elliot, putting everything that has happened thus far in the season in a new light.
</li><li> It is revealed in the series finale that the Elliot we've been watching isn't the real Elliot - he's just another alter, like Mr. Robot, created to protect Elliot's psyche - and the real Elliot has been trapped in a fantasy world inside his mind since before the start of the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowhereMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowhereMan">Nowhere Man</a></em>, an early UPN drama, was about a man who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">UnPersoned</a> over a compromising photograph of U.S. Soldiers executing Third World peasants. He traveled the country trying to unravel the conspiracy that was behind his erasure and reclaim his old life. After twenty-odd episodes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> and conflicting explanations about why the photo was important, the finale closed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that his old life never existed. He was really a government agent that had been captured by the conspiracy and implanted with false memories, and his entire cross-country odyssey had been a test of how much of the lie he would believe. This may have been intended to lead into a second season, but it was never produced.
</li><li> An overseas example from Japan: the tv show <em>Papadoru!</em>, or <em>Papa wa Idol</em> (meaning "Papa is an Idol"), where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kanjani8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Kanjani8">Kanjani8</a>'s Nishikido Ryo plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDanza">Nishikido Ryo, a member of Kanjani8</a> who falls in love with a convenience store worker with three children and marries her in secrecy but soon they are outed by the media. The show basically goes between getting to know his wife's children and him dealing with the backlash of his fans and the group members' reactions to him not telling them about his marriage. In the last episode, everyone gets a happy ending and then it's shown that the rooms are actually sets and <em>it was all a fucking tv show within a tv show.</em>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em> episode "Give &amp; Take", Lister is kidnapped by an insane medical droid, Asclepius. When Rimmer and Kryten rescue him they accidentally destroy a specimen jar containing two kidneys, then discover that Lister is missing his kidneys, and presume the kidneys they destroyed were Lister's, which had been removed by Asclepius. However, the plot is resolved when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">they travel back in time to remove the kidneys from a past version of Lister and implant them in the present-day Lister</a>, meaning that his kidneys had already been removed before he even met Asclepius - the implication being that the droid was actually perfectly sane, and was trying to give Lister a life-saving operation, and if Rimmer and Kryten had not waded in the events of the episode would never have happened.
</li><li> The final episode of the original run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Roseanne">Roseanne</a></em>, in which it's revealed that all of the show's characters are simply altered versions of the real people in Roseanne's life. Further that, a number of key events and facts were altered... including that the 'real' Roseanne's husband <em>died</em> of the heart attack Dan survived.
</li><li> Parodied on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> with Kevin Spacey as host (in an obvious reference to the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects">The Usual Suspects</a></em>). Andy Samberg was late to rehearsals and Spacey starts to give him a verbal beating, only for Samberg to relate a long and complicated story that explains his tardiness including meeting up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Radiohead">Radiohead</a> and having to confront one of those human statues who wore gold paint. Spacey forgives him and lets him go, only to turn around and see elements of the story on his back wall. Radiohead came from a mannequin head on top of a radio and the gold painted human statue was a picture of Spacey with his Oscar. It then went a step further, showing an entire line of items and symbols that spells out an entire sentence Pictionary-style.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">My</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Screw Up</a>" has Dr. Cox dealing with guilt over a patient dying while talking with his best friend and brother-in-law Ben. The dialogue implied it was a one episode patient who died while under J.D.'s care while Dr. Cox ran trivial errands but it was actually Ben, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackForTheDead">whose cancer had returned</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">was a hallucination of sorts to cope with the shock</a>. This explains why Dr. Cox was so angry at JD, it was not just any patient like the audience would assume. Earlier in the episode when someone made a comment about him always carrying around his camera, he replied with, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">"'til the day I die."</a> The rest of the episode he doesn't have his camera with him and no other character acknowledges his presence despite some goofy antics. This is similar to the episode Ben first appeared in, where JD day-dreamed the entire second half because he didn't want to believe the test results that said Ben had cancer in the first place.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerrenBrown">Derren Brown</a>'s <em>The Séance</em> is about a séance with twelve medical students who volunteer to try and contact the spirit of a person who died as part of a suicide pact. The volunteers "make contact" with a young woman named Jane, complete with video and evidence confirming the things stated by the volunteer's selected medium. At the end, Derren explains some of what happened, asks the volunteers to wait, and walks outside. He reaches "Jane" in the van, perfectly alive, and calls her inside to meet the volunteers. The only thing missing is a rimshot. A good deal of Brown's specials have something like this.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Elsewhere#Final_episode">final scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StElsewhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StElsewhere">St. Elsewhere</a></em> showed such a radically different interpretation of the major characters it opens the possibility that the entire series was an in-story delusion. One series writer <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Westphall#The_Tommy_Westphall_Universe_Hypothesis">deduced<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonWelding">Canon Welding</a> that "90% of all television" is a subplot of a <em>St. Elsewhere</em> episode.
</li><li> "The Invaders", a classic episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTwilightZone1959">The Twilight Zone (1959)</a></em>, features a lone woman (Agnes Moorehead) living alone in a rustic cabin in the middle of a windswept prairie. As she goes about her chores, she hears a strange noise on the roof and discovers an alien spaceship sitting on it, with two tiny aliens emerging in space suits. The rest of the episode, which is filmed almost completely dialogue-free beyond the unnamed woman's grunts and screams, sees her terrified of the titular invaders, which repeatedly come after her and attack with laser weapons and a knife. After she finally succeeds in killing the aliens, we hear one of them beaming a desperate message saying to avoid this planet and its "race of giants". A case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensSpeakingEnglish">Aliens Speaking English</a>? No—the camera then pans to reveal that the spaceship the woman is destroying reads "U.S. AIR FORCE". Suddenly, we realize that the "human" woman we were rooting for is actually a <em>sixty-foot tall alien</em>, and the "invaders" were humans from Earth.
</li><li> Season one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Westworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Westworld">Westworld</a></em>: The scenes with William and Logan actually happened thirty years prior to the events of the rest of the series — and William, the goody-two-shoes who was reluctant to engage in the debauchery that Logan brought him there for, grew up to become the depraved Man in Black from the present-day sequences, the flashback serving as his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>.
</li><li> In all places, the family sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesDear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesDear">Yes, Dear</a></em>. An episode revolves around the lead character Greg's reluctant attendance at a therapy session. The episode consists of flashbacks to elements of his life that have scarred him in the present day. At the end of the session, right after he leaves, the psychologist (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpinCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpinCity">Michael Boatman</a>) comes to a realization that the whole thing was a trick. The ending features an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheUsualSuspects">The Usual Suspects</a></em> as he drops his cup of coffee in shock, and the camera cuts to a limping Greg gradually walking normally (his leg had fallen asleep).

<ul><li> The music video for "Molly" by Rites of Ash seems to be telling the story of a guy who goes to a strip club, starts fixating on one of the strippers, follows her when she leaves and abducts her, though she manages to break free and flee through a forest. Until the ending, when the video shows the <em>guy</em> being chased and the stripper standing over him with a knife in her hand. We then get a flashback that shows us that everyone who works at the club is working together to abduct chosen victims from the people who go there, and the video ends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">the real victim, either dead or unconscious, being dragged off.</a>

The song humorously describes how miserable he has been since somebody left him (presumably a lover) using a lot of over-the-top similes to illustrate the pain he is. But the final line of the song is "I feel almost as bad as I did, when you were still here!"
</li><li> The music video to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AltJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AltJ">Alt-J</a>'s "Breezeblocks" is done in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackToFront">Back to Front</a> format.

As it goes on though it turns out he killed her in self-defense. She tied up his wife and attempted to kill him.

The last line of the song ("The day my Mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.") reveals that the narrator was the aforementioned daughter; flipping the song from "relating the events of a minor scandal" to "Daughter bragging about her mom's Moment of Awesome." Now that last line is so well known (arguably the best known line of the song), many don't even realize it was a twist.
</li><li> A well-known example is Brotherhood of Man's "Save All Your Kisses For Me", the winner of the 1976 Eurovision Song Contest. It sounds like it's addressed to a loving housewife, but the final line - "Won't you save them for me, even though you're only three?" - reveals it's actually addressed to the singer's young child.
<ul><li> Gilbert O'Sullivan's "Claire" uses exactly the same twist. Some years after the song's release, Alexei Sayle snarkily joked, "does he still wanna shag his three-year-old niece?"
</li></ul></li><li> The song <em>Královna z Dundrum Bay</em> ("<em>Queen of Dundrum Bay</em>", Czech version of <em>Star of the County Down</em>) has the audience believe that it is about a man who has fallen in love with the farmer's daughter, who then tragically fell ill and died. Near the end of the song it's revealed that "the Queen" was a mare rather than a woman.
</li><li> After listing all of his attributes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBonzoDogBand">The Bonzo Dog Band</a>'s eponymous "I'm The Urban Spaceman" announces at the end of the song that he doesn't exist.
</li><li> "The Naughty Lady of Shady Lane" by the Ames Brothers makes it sound as if a lady of ill repute has recently moved into a previously sedate neighborhood. She makes a lot of noise and has everybody talking about her. She never says "no" to liquid refreshment. She isn't picky about who comes to visit her. But the things they're trying to pin on her won't hold much water. She only needs someone to change her, and then she'll be as nice as can be. The last line reveals that the lady in question is a nine-day-old baby. Now read those words again, and they take on an entirely different meaning.

And she also stole the microchip while he was asleep. Not that the last part would make a difference, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">another quadruple agent had switched the real chip for a fake one</a>. What's even more surprising? The Boss, who was the aforementioned mentor, <em>never actually defected to the Soviet Union</em>. Her supposed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a> was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDefector">Fake Defection</a>, and she would have used that in order to kill Volgin and stop the construction of the Shagohod. But then, Volgin decided to nuke a building to test out the capabilities of a small-yield nuclear missile she brought along to convince Volgin to let her in. At that point, the original covert operation that Snake took part in was unveiled to the Kremlin, making America and the Soviet Union ready to nuke each other out of orbit unless someone could go in and kill both Volgin and The Boss. In short? She died <em>to save face</em> for both countries (especially her own), and to be known in history as a traitor, and <em>she was completely fine with that</em>.

The first ending reveals that The Boss wasn't REALLY loyal to America, but to the Philosophers; extra in-game content explains that her ultimate plan was to slowly gain power and influence from her deeds on the battlefield, manipulating wars to slow the development of weapons technology and recruiting hordes of elite followers through sheer charisma, until she had enough power to force the world into a united peace. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ansv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ansv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ansv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Unfortunately, Ocelot's existence is his first wrench in a plan ever; The Boss got drunk on joy when she realized she was pregnant, which screwed up the biggest mission of her life: killing the apparent traitorous scientist Dr. Von Neumann before he could complete his work on the Manhattan Project. It turns out he was not a traitor, but it was a rumor spread by Soviet spies, likely to gain the technological edge in creating nuclear weapons. The Boss believed that her failure to kill the scientist caused the world to spin out of control, as the Cold War started right after the end of World War II, with the Manhattan Project having laid the groundwork for the conflict. Hence, the reason she was willing to sacrifice herself was self-rationalized guilt, believing she failed to instill a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ConspiracyTheories/HToN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ConspiracyTheories/HToN">New World Order</a> because she got pregnant from a whimsical sexual encounter</span>. Big Boss realizes that his goals differed from his teacher, she was using him as a tool that she personally reviled, and finally gets the closure he needs to walk his own path - as a morally-bankrupt mercenary leader. And then it gets <em>worse</em>: Paz, that 16-year old schoolgirl who drove 20% of the entire plot, is revealed to be Cipher's quadruple agent whose reveal and destructively-psychotic agenda<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2iele');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2iele" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2iele');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">nuking America to goad them into a third World War</span> make Big Boss snap.

This would seem to imply that the entire game is taking place in her head, but several throw-away events scattered throughout could be taken to imply that Cheryl's fantasy is somehow interacting with the real world. Ultimately the player is left unsure as to how much, if any, of the game's previous events really took place, or whether any of the people Harry meets on his journey actually existed.

The game is a pirate story set in the Caribbean. When it seems that protagonist Guybrush Threepwood has found the treasure Big Whoop, which allegedly can help him escape to another world from zombie pirate LeChuck, he falls down a massive rift. After switching on an electric light in a modern-looking tunnel system, he is confronted by LeChuck, who seemingly was inside the now smashed treasure chest. LeChuck reveals that they are brothers and tries to send him to a dimension of infinite pain with a special voodoo doll, but it just sends him in the next room instead. Guybrush explores the tunnels and finds the skeletons of his dead parents and a ticket with an "E" on it in the remains of the treasure chest. When Guybrush manages to defeat LeChuck, he pulls his face (now claimed to be a mask) off and recognises him as Chuckie, his long-lost brother. Chuckie explains that he was sent by their mother to look for Guybrush, and they find themselves as children at an amusement park with their angry parents. The park closely resembles an area earlier in the game, and there is a big sign saying "Big Whoop". When the reunited family walks off, Chuckie looks at the camera with a demonic gaze, and the credits roll. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a>, Guybrush's love interest Elaine Marley looks down at the chasm, wondering if LeChuck put some spell on Guybrush.

Everything you did during the game just furthered the villain's plans, in the end he succeeds in his plan to destroy <em>time itself</em>, and there's <em>literally nothing you can do about it.</em> In fact, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a>, you get a scene from the villain, mocking the <em>player</em> for trying to find a way out of the trap.

What makes this even more aggravating is that the characters are told several times before the end of the game that, if they continue, Etro will likely end up dead. They are easy to miss or overlook, but are sprinkled throughout the entire game. The mini-boss before the final boss rush even has Yuel's voice telling them multiple times to stop and turn back. They, and the player, think it's just a trick. It's not.

</li><li> The ending to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShockInfinite">BioShock Infinite</a></em> turns the story from a rescue mission to save a young girl from a bunch of amazing flying racists, into a multi-dimensional hopping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> that ends with the player character being killed off after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> that he is both the protagonist (as the player character), and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> (as an NPC), and that the girl he was rescuing is his biological daughter. In particular, the phrase "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords">Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt</a>", rather than being an ultimatum by his creditors, was actually proof that he sold his daughter to the Luteces in the first place.

<ul><li> Once you find out that Alvis is actually the true God of the universe]], it's interesting to look back and consider just where Meyneth and Zanza stand in the game's cosmology, since technically they aren't really gods, but rather just siphoning off some of Alvis's power.
</li><li> And then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChronicles2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em> reveals itself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthSequel">Stealth Sequel</a> (surprising nobody), but re-contextualizes the ending of the first game again. Zanza could never be anything <em>but</em> evil, as he's only half of a complete being; the benevolent half of Professor Klaus was left behind in the original universe his experiment took place in(<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XC2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XC2">XC 2</a>'s). Revelations about just what role Monado-holders play in the cosmology also provide more consistent rules to some of the first game's more unexpected events.
</li><li> In its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XenobladeChroniclesX">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a></em>, the ending reveals that the Lifehold Core's quantum computer, that was supposed to house the consciousnesses of everyone in New LA, has been destroyed since the moment the <em>White Whale</em> made planetfall on Mira. This renders everything you've been told about the nature of mimeosome operation invalid, and opens up a far bigger mystery of just how in the world any humans in NLA can still be alive in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalGearbolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ElementalGearbolt">Elemental Gearbolt</a></em> pits two Elementals against a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> prince plotting to make the world a better place — through any means necessary. All are destroyed in the end. Close attention to the credits reveals the twist — it was all a set-up. Both parties were used as unwitting proxies by external forces. The prince got technology from an extra-dimensional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmsDealer">Arms Dealer</a> that stood to gain from his plan to awaken an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> manages to incorporate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> feature into the story. Upon beating all three routes (each one requiring the player to destroy one of the Ancients by summoning another Ancient,) it's revealed that the entire thing was a plot by Mantorok, the fourth Ancient, who manipulated events across three different timelines before combining them all into a new timeline where all three Ancients are dead.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheWolfAmongUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheWolfAmongUs">The Wolf Among Us</a></em>: Naturally, as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderMystery">Murder Mystery</a>. The final conversation with Nerissa in Episode 5 does this tenfold, with her revealing she gave false testimony to catch the Crooked Man, before giving the biggest Wham Line of the series, implying very heavily that either she was posing as Faith at the start of Episode 1, or that she is actually Faith, and has been impersonating Nerissa throughout the season, and the first victim was actually the real Nerissa.
</li><li> The first playthrough of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NieR">NieR</a></em> ends with a colossal twist: the Shades, the main enemies that you have been fighting the entire time, were not in fact mindless cruel monsters, but sentient beings, and what's more, they are the original, true humans of the world. Everyone you thought had been human this whole time was actually a bio-magical clone, to be merged together with the original corresponding Shade later on when a specific protocol (Grimoire Weiss and Grimoire Noir merging together). Although it might not be <em>entirely</em> clear by the end, the game has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> that adds many additional scenes, which basically confirm that you were a mass murderer who slaughtered countless innocent people (even children) who were just trying to defend themselves, and your actions basically doomed the entire human race to extinction.
</li><li> The sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NierAutomata">NieR: Automata</a></em> also features this in a huge twist in a conversation right before the final battle: the reveal that 2B was actually 2E, an Executioner-class android tasked with observing and murdering 9S if he ever <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">learned too much</a>, and that she has murdered him many, <em>many</em> times prior to the game beginning, but at the same time was horribly conflicted over it due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InLoveWithTheMark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InLoveWithTheMark">having grown close to him over the 3 year period they were assigned together as partners.</a> An even bigger twist is the fact that 9S <em>knew this all along</em> yet still willingly chose to stay with his murderer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">through thick and thin.</a> This one conversation completely changes everything about how the player perceives the 2B/9S relationship, and re-contextualizes every single scene and line of dialogue they have together throughout the entire game.
<ul><li> Ending B may count as well, depending on whether or not you consider it a proper ending (the next three endings are effectively the final half of the game, after all.) 9S discovers that humans were extinct long before the aliens showed up, meaning that the androids' millennia-long war against the machine lifeforms has been utterly pointless. The endgame of route C/D also has some pretty game-changing twists, such as the revelation that YoRHa black boxes are made from machine lifeform cores, making the protagonists and their enemies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>, and the revelation that both sides of the conflict have been conspiring to perpetuate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheForeverWar">Forever War</a>, to the point that YoRHa, which was supposed to be the secret weapon against the machine lifeforms, was created with countermeasures to destroy them should they ever gain too much of a foothold. Try playing through the whole game again knowing that all the main characters' actions, and even <em>their very existence</em> is all utterly pointless. No wonder 9S became an utterly distraught <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">Straw Nihilist</a> by the end of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> The "spare Pagan" and "secret" endings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FarCry4">Far Cry 4</a></em> reveal that, though an eccentric at best and psychopath at worst, Pagan Min actually didn't have any ill intentions for Ajay and had told the truth from minute one. Ajay's father killed his wife's and Min's daughter (who had gotten pregnant because he sent her to seduce Min) Lakshima, and Ajay is the true heir to the Kyrat region. Min fully intended to take Ajay to the place his mother wanted her ashes to be put to rest and then give him Kyrat, but him jumping the gun on hearing the sounds of torture (with the exception of the secret ending) made him leave and empower a group of blatant terrorists. And then, whichever Golden Path leader you've supported through the civil war turns out to have done a long-jump over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>, either causing a brutal purging of the Golden Path, or enslaving citizens, the adults as slave laborers on drug plantations and the kids to be warped into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a>, leaving you with the choice of killing them for crossing the line.
</li><li> The Yharnam Sunrise ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> reveals that everything you had experienced and everyone/thing you met/killed was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> set up by the Great Ones/The Moon Presence as a means of using humans to propagate themselves, and Gehrman chopping your head off is what was able to wrench you out of it. Unfortunately this comes at the cost of every other Yharnamite still being trapped in the nightmare with no conceivable way out, and there is no closure given for what happens to the Hunter upon leaving it.
</li><li> The game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EtherOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EtherOne">Ether One</a></em> has the player in the role of a "restorer" who, through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">revolutionary technology</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JourneyToTheCenterOfTheMind">projecting into the mind of a patient who is afflicted with dementia</a> in the hopes of putting the patient's fragmented memories back together. Along the way, the player is harassed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">the doctor who is heading the project, who seems more interested in retaining funding than actually helping the patient</a>. As the end approaches, the player learns the truth about the patient and the patient's memories: the person whose mind the player thinks that they were exploring has been dead for years. You are her surviving husband, and the actual patient, and the fragmented memories are his own. The "restorer" technology does not exist. The entire premise is the patient's afflicted mind attempting to make some sense of the conventional therapy that he is receiving. The callous attitude of the head doctor is the patient's mental reinterpretation of the patient's actual doctor and, as the therapy continues, the interpretation of the doctor becomes more and more sympathetic as the patient begins to trust her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a></em> is set at a new and improved "modern" version of the titular pizzeria from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">the first game</a>, which had closed down some time ago, with brand new high-tech animatronics put in place while the original ones are placed in storage and used for parts. The original guard now works the day shift too. However, Phone Guy is still around, despite being seemingly killed years ago at the old location, and several Retraux minigames seen after dying hint at something sinister happening at the new location, similar to the backstory hidden in the first game. It isn't until the completion of Night 5 that it all makes sense - Jeremy's paycheck is dated 1987, and therefore the events of the game happen <em>before</em> those of the first game, and during said game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">bloody</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">past</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DearMariko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DearMariko">Dear Mariko</a></em> makes you think that you're playing Mariko, a young woman whose relationship is falling apart because of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>. However, the True End reveals that the character you're playing as <em>is</em> the stalker. You're given several hints throughout the game about who your character really is.
</li><li> It's not the main plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em> that does this, but the bonus dungeon. Inside, it's revealed that the malevolence humans produce just by existing and having negative emotions is poisonous to Seraphim, who wanted to destroy the human world because of this. Some Seraphim objected, and made a bet that if the could prove coexistence was possible, the worlds would be open to each other instead. The Seraphim accepted the bet, but heavily loaded the dice, by cursing humans and Seraphim (known to the humans as Malakhim) such that malevolence would warp them into Daemons and Dragons respectively, thus driving the two races apart; should Malevolence ever cloud the entire world, the original Seraphim will go through with the plan to destroy the human world. The ramifications are extensive; the original Seraphim become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a>, the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> is revealed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NecessarilyEvil">Necessarily Evil</a>, and with that cycle broken Maotelus has much bigger responsibilities placed on him. That last one carries over to distant sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria">Tales of Zestiria</a></em>, as it means if Maotelus hasn't been completely purified and freed at the end of the game (and it's not clear if he was), then the game's good ending leaves the world in an unstoppable death spiral.
</li><li> The central conceit of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecondSight">Second Sight</a></em> is that each level alternates between the present and the past, showing you how your protagonist got to where he is. It's only near the end of the game that you discover the game has <em>actually</em> been alternating between a possible future and the present; the levels that were ostensibly the "present" before were actually precognitive flash-forwards, and the "past" has always been the present.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBeginnersGuide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBeginnersGuide">The Beginner's Guide</a></em>. The game is ostensibly about Davey Wreden, creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable">The Stanley Parable</a></em>, wanting to show off some old short games made by an old friend of his who inspired him to become a games creator. Davey invites the player to play them in chronological order while he narrates his thoughts on them. The later games begin straining against this premise until the last game in the collection reveals that the 'Davey Wreden' who's been narrating is <em>not</em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Davey Wreden, and narrator!Davey is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> whose motivations are very different from what the premise made them out to be. Going back through the earlier chapters of the game with this knowledge in hand changes virtually everything.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable">The Stanley Parable</a></em> takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> as <em>multiple</em> endings may or may not change everything you know about what the game is. You could be playing an ordinary game with a simple storyline, a fight of control between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">the Player and the Narrator</a>, a story about the daydreams of an ordinary man being taken too far, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">meta</a> game criticizing the illusion of choice, or something even more sinister that you must escape from...
</li><li> A fairly significant one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyType0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyType0">Final Fantasy Type-0</a></em>. At the end of the game, one nation gains control of the four crystals. As a result, Tempus Fini (a.k.a the end of the world) is triggered and huge seemingly-unkillable monsters descend from the sky and murder everyone. Our heroes fight their way through the final dungeon and defeat the final boss at the cost of their own lives... But surprise! This was just the latest in the 600,104,972 cycles the world had already been through, each time ending in one nation gaining control of all four crystals and bringing about the end of the world. This is all an experiment being performed by Class 0's mother-figure Arecia Al-Rashia (actually a deity in disguise) and her unseen counterpart. Admittedly, Class 0's final venture is a bit different from the rest and Arecia does in fact break the spiral in the best ending by doing away with the crystals and allowing Class 0 to live normal, warless lives. Regardless of that fact, finding out your journey has been one of over six hundred million failed ventures engineered by a seemingly disinterested deity who could've snapped her fingers and stopped all the death gives that second play-through a far bleaker feeling.

(She remembered their original meeting, and he didn't.) It also explained WHY he had that inexplicable desire to go to the moon in the first place...
</li><li> In <em>Finding Paradise</em>, the main revelation is that Colin's best friend, Faye, never existed - she was literally an imaginary friend, but so vivid that she appeared as a true person in his memory. Going back to all the scenes she appeared in with this knowledge gives you that classic feeling from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixthSense">The Sixth Sense</a> - the sudden realization that nobody EXCEPT Colin ever actually interact with or respond to her. She didn't disappear from his later memories because she died in some tragic accident, as was speculated earlier - she just faded away when Colin met his future wife, and stopped being so lonely. Doesn't make her final goodbye any less of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>, though...

This attack makes Kratos decide that he and his son Atreus have to scatter his late wife Faye's ashes right away, instead of waiting as he had originally intended.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> ends with Neku realizing that by competing in the Reaper's Game for the chance to return to life, as well as saving his friends and preventing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssimilationPlot">Assimilation Plot</a> from consuming Shibuya, he's actually helped Joshua, his former partner and the Composer, win a bet with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Kitaniji</a>, thereby allowing Joshua to destroy Shibuya, although Joshua seems to reconsider after his final duel with Neku. Similarly, when you find the last of Hanekoma's Secret Reports (discussing the game's events, including the influence of a figure known as the Fallen Angel), you find a secret that paints all the others in a new light- Hanekoma is the Fallen Angel, and his actions drive much of the game's plot.

The ending has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> but it isn't obvious until later. The original ending reveals that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream">All Just a Dream</a> of a dying little boy in a coma after his family got into a car crash, killing both his parents and damaging the right side of his sister's face. The boy ends up waking up to embrace his sister, but the ending was considered too dark and frightening so it was later censored. In <em>Drawn to Life Compilation</em> the ending uses a much cuter art-style and is about a boy passes out after falling out of a tree. It's still darker than expected but it's not as dark as the original.

Then, during the ending, The G-Man brings Alyx 5 years into the future, to the moment where Eli is killed at the end of <em>Episode 2</em>. He allows her to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">save her father, changing the cliffhanger that the story has been stuck on for the past 13 years.</a> As a consequence, however, he takes Alyx into his employment, putting her into stasis.

For most of the game, the player is lead to believe that Harman is the core personality of the team, calling all the shots, and that Garcian, the one who leads the others members out in the field, is merely another one of his personalities and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupportingProtagonist">Supporting Protagonist</a>. In reality, it's <em>Garcian</em> who's the core personality, his real identity being Emir Parkreiner, a mentally-unstable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">Tyke Bomb</a> groomed from childhood to be an assassin.

Harman Smith, meanwhile, is actually some kind of enigmatic deity with multiple avatars, one of which was another one of Emir's victims (thus becoming another one of his personalities) and may be responsible for Garcian's current state in the first place. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">Yes, it's all just as confusing as it sounds.</a>

Throughout the story, the protagonists are frequently shown glimpses of their future "destiny" without any context, such as Midgar nearly being destroyed by Meteor. This finally comes to a head in the climax, in which the heroes mistakenly conclude that they must defeat the whispers in order to save the planet and defeat Sephiroth, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">unaware that doing so could in fact end up averting Sephiroth's original fated defeat</a>.

While the cast had assumed that they'd been imprisoned inside of the school for much of the game, Hope's Peak turns out to be a <em>shelter</em> from the ruined world, and they'd agreed to stay in there.

The differences between each team isn't because they take place in alternate universes, but because they take place at different points in time with the future team imitating the past team as best as they can to set in motion an elaborate plan to save lives.
</li><li> For most of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LiarLiar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LiarLiar">Liar Liar</a></em>, we're meant to believe Yukari was spurned into murdering her cheating ex-boyfriend by jealousy and that it was her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>.

Throughout the game, the narration is from a third person perspective. But then the ending reveals it's not: it's a first person perspective from another character's point of view. The character you were REALLY playing as. The top screen doesn't show the present or the events that are happening to your player character. It shows the future. You're playing as a character who's seeing the future on the top screen, while simultaneously experiencing near identical events on the bottom screen; the touch screen where the gameplay happens, in the past. The two screens actually show exactly what the REAL player character is seeing during the Nonary Game: The world split into two, where she can see what's happening to her, and what's happening to Junpei in the future at the same time. The only exception to this is the game's final puzzle where you finally play as Junpei for the first proper time. You have to turn your DS upside down so that the future is now on the touch screen, to reflect the fact that this is the first real time you're actually playing as Junpei, who you thought you were playing as the entire time.
<ul><li> Theres also the reveal of Zeros true identity and motives- its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Akane</a>, and shes not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">Sadist</a> but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalBoss">whos getting revenge against</a> the <em>real</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. This completely changes the meaning of her various interactions with Junpei. And the above reveal means <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">you were playing as Zero all along</a>.</em>
</li><li> Santa is Akanes brother and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">helper</a> throughout the ordeal.
</li><li> The real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is Ace, the leader of your group who is actually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">CEO of Cradle Pharmaceuticals</a> and original creator of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Nonary Game</a>.
</li><li> The current Nonary Game was never actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame">Deadly Game</a>: only two people (both of whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">were Aces helpers</a>) had bombs on thier wrists, and the game was <em>designed</em> so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLives">Everybody Lives</a> in the end. To top it off, the game took place not on a sinking ship, but a building in the desert made to look like a ship. In other words, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodAllAlong">Zero/Akane never actually put anyone in danger, other than the ones who deserved it</a>.

Included twists are:
<ul><li> The fact you were playing as an old man the entire game, not a 22 year old college student (more specifically, it was an old man with a 22 year old conciousness residing in them).
</li><li> That Luna is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoboticReveal">robot</a>.
</li><li> That Sigma, the player character, was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Zero himself</a>.
</li><li> That K is <em>two different people depending on what path you pick to go down thanks to the effects of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchroedingersCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SchroedingersCat">Schrödinger's Cat</a></em>. One is Sigmas clone, and the other is Akane.
</li><li> That the game takes place on the moon.
</li><li> Time is actually going in fast forward due to the effects of everyone having the virus Radical-6. The effects of the difference in gravity due to them being on the moon through, balances it out and makes everything seem like it's going at a normal speed.
</li><li> Tenmyouji is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviousPlayerCharacterCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreviousPlayerCharacterCameo">Junpei, the protagonist from the previous Zero Escape game</a>.
</li><li> The old woman is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">Akane, the Zero from the previous game and the one who helped set up this game too</a>.
</li><li> The purpose of the AB game is to save the world from Radical-6 and the cult that set the virus loose. And Dio is a leader in the cult.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ZeroTimeDilemma">Zero Time Dilemma</a></em> has a few as well.
<ul><li> Phis background was never clear in the previous game. In here, we learn that shes Sigma and Dianas <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidFromTheFuture">Kid from the Future</a>. And so is <em>the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a></em>, Zero II/Delta.
</li><li> Delta himself was present throughout the whole game, simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack">offscreen</a>. The character that Team Q referred to as Q was actually him, while the little boy who appeared to be Q was Sean. And Sean is a robot.
