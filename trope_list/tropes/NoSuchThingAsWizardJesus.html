Whether they're born as mutants, mages, wizards, or something else, they're able to perform miraculous feats that warp reality itself.
</p><p>Hrm, weren't there some other historical people who performed miraculous feats? People who ended up being worshipped? If you have these wizards running around turning lead into gold, who is to say that in this universe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> wasn't just a cultist wizard conning people over by turning water into wine?
</p><p>Nope, Jesus was never a wizard. This will <em><strong>never</strong></em> be brought up. You might get some talk about how, oh, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Greek Gods</a> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">really aliens</a> or something, but if a character ever brings up a modern faith that people still practice widely—Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, or Islam — nobody will ever go, "Say, these people we're fighting can resurrect themselves. I wonder if that means Jesus was..." While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">Beethoven may have been an alien spy</a>, Jesus never was.

</p><p>And despite the trope name, this refers to all religious figures and prophets, e.g. Krishna, Moses, and Mohammed. This trope is for when half of the reason you're part of a religion is because of records of miracles performed by gods, prophets, or messiahs—a world where everyone is running around with superpowers and constantly coming back from death should dilute that, or at least be addressed in some way.
</p><p>There is a pretty good reason why this trope is so prevalent. If you try to subvert it, and say that Jesus was, in fact, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">wizard</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">mutant</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican">shaman</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psychic</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">alien</a>, people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameBait">WILL be offended</a> (and if you say anything bad about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LRonHubbard">L.

It doesn't matter how perfect and kind and wonderful you might portray him as, there will be always the implication that he was either delusional, or a charlatan, because he went on to found a religion that portrays him as the son of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse">Verse</a> where abilities such as his are rather common.

"Yes, I just turned water into wine, but while I have your attention why don't you stay and listen to what you can do about your soul?" If the religions in the universe have decided to worship these figures for their teachings instead of supernatural claims or whatever powers or origins they might have had, that's fine. The problem is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">it never plays out that way</a>.

Despite <em>utilizing</em> the existing supernatural elements of the series, part of the reason the corpse serves as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> of the Part is that its power is still on a whole different level and breaks several established rules.

<ul><li> In many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a> comics verses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> <em>are</em> superheroes and nobody says boo. The closest they come is having these supergods occasionally inspire (small, fringe) worshippers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mutants">Mutants</a> have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">various important personages</a> throughout history and have been around since the dawn of the Egyptian civilization at least. Try crucifying Wolverine and stuffing him in a cave for a couple of days and act surprised when he comes back to life. Also, during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HouseOfM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/HouseOfM">House of M</a></em> storyline, a teacher asks who the first mutant was "and don't say Jesus, since he doesn't count".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0rg77');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0rg77" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0rg77');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically, the teacher in House of M said not to mention Jesus or Moses because she was looking for the first mutant to be recorded historically. She leaves plenty of openings for them to be poorly documented Mutants.</span> Interestingly enough, a few modern storylines subvert this by revealing that some angels and demons were actually early mutants. Though as your standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyKitchenSink">Fantasy Kitchen Sink</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> also has <em>real</em> angels and demons.
<ul><li> Wolverine <em>has</em> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comics.org/issue/46988/cover/4/?style=default">been crucified,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>- bolted to a big letter X by the Reavers and left to bake in the Australian outback. (They just had to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomp</a> him with a surprise attack and eight-to-one odds, and he went up on the "cross" as docile as you please.) It even overloaded his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> for a time (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreepPowerSeep">couldn't do that these days</a>), forcing him to run and hide instead of kill, and surprisingly, he never did get to give them the claws in return; changing writer syndrome deprived him of his sweet revenge. Though the Reavers were actually getting <em>their</em> revenge for the time Wolverine tore them apart back when they were ordinary human <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> rather than cyborgs.
</li></ul></li><li> Only adding to the confusion is the existence of any number of demons who claim to be <em>THE</em> Satan, with Mephisto being particularly prominent, but none of them really having much to back their claim up, and all of them being notorious liars.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals">The Eternals</a> only make things more complicated. Having been created by the Celestials at the dawn of humanity as a separate race rather than anything divine, they were worshiped as gods, and their names reflect this - Makkari (Mercury) and Thena (Athena) are examples, and at least one has been worshipped by the Incans as well. Except that there is ALSO a pantheon of Greek gods, who <em>are</em> divine. This all led to some confusion when Hercules was claimed to be one of the Eternals with false memories of the actual Hercules (turns out to have been a mistranslation on the part of an Eternal conversing with a Celestial).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GhostRider">Ghost Rider</a> and some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheMightyThor">Thor</a> stories have somewhat addressed this. A Ghost Rider story confirmed Lucifer, angels, heaven, the Antichrist, and God were all real. However, in story they come off as no different than other pantheons of gods with maybe some different labels. Of course, God spoke, but was never seen on panel and Jesus was not mentioned. Several Thor stories have implied Asgard is aware of the Monotheistic God, but have issues with the claim to be the only god.

<ul><li> Jesus was actually, canonically, the real deal in the DC-verse; he's part of the backstory of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a>, who serves as an agent of God's Divine Wrath in the form of The Spirit of Vengeance. He was absent at the time of Jesus for the specific reason that Jesus was the Spirit of Forgiveness and the Lord did not want the two of them on Earth at the same time, as it would seem like he was sending mixed messages.
</li><li> There was also a storyline in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorFate">Doctor Fate</a> involving a vampire who believed he could turn back into a human by drinking Jesus's blood from the Holy Grail.
</li></ul></li><li> This taboo once derailed an entire comic book story arc. Writer/artist Rick Veitch was working on a storyline in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SwampThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SwampThing">Swamp Thing</a></em> (after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanMoore">Alan Moore</a>'s famous run) where the title character was falling backwards through time, and encountering both real historical figures and DC characters of the past. The plan was to culminate the story during the time of Jesus (usually obliquely called "The Nazarene" in the DC Universe). Swamp Thing himself was to take the role of an angel who gives Jesus a drink of water on his way to Calvary. And yes, the story was going to reveal that The Nazarene was, yes, a wizard, no different from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorFate">Doctor Fate</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Zatanna" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Zatanna">Zatanna</a> or the other mystical characters in the DC Universe. DC management popped a head-gasket and killed the story long after it had received official approval, so Veitch and his collaborators quit, and the story was never resolved.
</li><li> The writer of <em>The Son Of Dracula</em> once got in an argument with the head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode">The Comics Code</a> over whether Christians would be offended if he put in a reference to the book's main character being powerless inside a church (both the writer and the head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheComicsCode">The Comics Code</a> were Jewish).
</li><li> At one point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">Impulse</a></em>, Max Mercury tries to convince Impulse that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">Santa Claus</a> isn't real, because his powers are implausible. Impulse quickly (how else?) debunks every objection by naming a superhero with the same power. (E.g., the Atom can get down small chimneys.)
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PlasticMan">Plastic Man</a> once tried to convince a child that Santa was real by telling him the story of an adventure he shared with the Justice League.

The story is ambiguous as to whether Jesus is really divine or not (his vampirism itself is not specified to be due to either science or magic), as the now-vampiric Jesus currently remembers that in his pre-vampire existence he was only just a mere mortal, but he ultimately concedes that while he remembers every instant of his post-vampire existence <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhotographicMemory">perfectly</a>, his memory of his human life meanwhile indeed remains as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFogOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFogOfAges">imperfect</a> as that of a normal human. In any case, the Catholic Church continues to keep him locked up in perpetuity for both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">noble</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheIronMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManInTheIronMask">self-serving</a> reasons.
</li><li> In Katherine Kurtz's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deryni">Deryni</a></em> novels there are factions within the Church that consider Deryni talents like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">healing</a> to be the work of the devil because they imitate Jesus' miracles. On more than one occasion this leads to anti-Deryni pogroms. The obvious question of whether Jesus was simply one of them using the same powers is never <em>directly</em> referenced, but obliquely underlies much of the story (those Deryni inclined to religion tend to see their powers as divine gifts in any case.)
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">Arthurian</a> fantasy novel <em>The Forever King</em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subversion</a>: The plot revolves around the history of the Grail, which traditionally gained its magical powers from an encounter with Jesus, but in this telling existed and had its powers — including the power to defeat death — long before he appeared on the scene. Late in the book, there's a flashback to the events surrounding Jesus' death and resurrection, from the point of view of a character who knows about the Grail; he initially assumes (rather smugly) that Jesus was just an ordinary man brought back to life by the Grail, but then is surprised and disturbed by the discovery that it couldn't have been the Grail, and so therefore must have been something else he doesn't understand, possibly even a genuine act of God.
</li><li> There's a scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkIsRising">The Dark Is Rising</a></em> where Will protects a church and the members of it from an invasion of the Dark forces. Afterwards, the priest tries to ascribe the powers of the Old Ones of the Light as miracles derived from the Christian god, who he says came first and created all of existence. The narration says that Will thinks of saying something to correct the priest but doesn't say how he would have corrected him - did God come later? Does God even exist? Do the powers of the Old Ones come from a totally different source but the Christian God still exists? The text is about as purposefully vague as you can get in this part of the book.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Nightside">Nightside</a></em> books and other series by Simon R. Green always make a point of saying that "only one man could ever bring the dead back to life" (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and the resurrected Judas explicitly identifies Christ as that man</span>) - completely ignoring that in the Bible, Elijah and Elisha could raise the dead as well, and some mediaeval saints were also said to have been capable of this. (Undead beings don't count.)
<ul><li> Its possible that Green overlooked Elijah and Elisha and others, on the other hand, most Christians would tell you that no, Elisha, Elijah, etc. did not raise anyone from the dead. They were ordinary men, and had no supernatural abilities or nature. Rather, it was God working through them that brought the dead back to life; they were merely His instruments. Thus, Jesus (being God) being the only man that can bring the dead back to life is quite correct.
</li><li> In <em>The Unnatural Enquirer</em> John Taylor says only one man ever <em>came back from Hell</em>, and that was Jesus. Perhaps a bit of a retcon?
<ul><li> Considering that John himself spent most of <em>Hex and the City</em> accompanied by Sinner, a man who was <em>booted out</em> of Hell for still feeling love, he was probably using hyperbole with that one.
</li></ul></li><li> Heck, in the books even <em>angels</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">God's own stormtroopers</a> can fix practically anything <em>except</em> death.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>.
<ul><li> Wizards and witches can do amazing things with their magic, yet are unable to bring back the dead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Harry was the only known person to have survived the Avada Kevadra curse - <em>twice</em> - although both times, it was because he was specially protected from it.</span> There are pretty good imitations of bringing back the dead, but the real thing doesn't exist. They also celebrate Christmas, one of the Hogwarts ghosts is the Fat Friar and Harry's parents have a Bible quote on their graves, so it seems likely that the wizarding community accepts conventional religion.
</li><li> Also, Ron spends a summer in Egypt and makes a mention in his postcard of the old spells the Egyptian wizards put on the sarcophagi and pyramids.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">J. K. Rowling</a> stated "Hogwarts is a multi-faith school." So, presumably, all the major religions are represented.
</li><li> Voldemort is stated to not have died, but this is only true in the most technical of senses. After his attack on the baby Harry, he became something that was described as 'less than the meanest ghost', and was capable of possessing bodies. While he might not have died by the strictest definition of the Potterverse, he could easily trick people into thinking that he had come back from the dead. In this case, any wizard with Horcruxes (Or alternatives), could put on a quite convincing show of dying and coming back. There's the problem that dark magic ruins your body. You do NOT get a good following looking like a snake, and cursing and subjugating your followers. You might get a cult of power hungry crazies, but you probably wouldn't ever be mainstream.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> is a bit complicated here:
<ul><li> First as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a> almost every deity you've heard of (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retgone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retgone">and many you haven't</a>) totally exist.. somewhere. If not without a twist or two (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Santa Claus AKA the Winter King AKA Odin, yes that Odin</span>) you probably didn't know. However the all the "little g" gods are essentially just powerful supernatural entities with peers like the Faerie Queens who are not said to be divinities. Likewise in the Nevernever all their realms are said to exist, some may require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinGame">a heist novel</a> to reach though.
</li><li> At the same time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Big G &amp; Co</a> certainly exist, but play by different rules without direct intervention beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence">Contrived Coincidence</a>. Twice now we've seen people's prayers for assistance answered within by the intervention of a Knight of the Cross, though Michael will admit He isn't always that quick. Angels and their Fallen brethren (who are distinct from demons) have been stated to wield power on a truly cosmic scale, but are subject to various rules keeping both from interfering in mortal affairs. Much. Relics of the Crucifixion not only exist but are at the center of several books, and can be powerful either because they are genuine, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">people believe they are</a>, or both at once. One said object is a holy sword containing a nail from the Cross wielded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Sanya the athiest/agnostic</a> who points out that perhaps this could all just be the work of merely powerful alien entities and actual coincidence. Sanya himself doesn't care because as long as he's helping people. The big implications of all this have been <strong>very</strong> scrupulously avoided. All very open to interpretation... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Funny/DeadBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Funny/DeadBeat">but those necromancers probably had nothing to do with Jesus.</a>
</li><li> Monotheistic God's existence is explicitly stated as true by both Archangel Uriel, the various Fallen, and even one of the Fairy Queens. The later seems to regard God as a power outside her own - like a particularly powerful third party. Oh, and the devil also exists (separate from the Fallen).
</li><li> Finally Harry repeatedly states he averts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">Religion Is Magic</a>, but many practitioners hold a different view and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">that they believe that makes it work for them anyways</a>. And since Harry believes in magic itself he can use his pentacle to do things like ward off vampires. Likewise those of great faith can achieve supernatural results without any magical ability at all, or at least nothing like what Harry uses. Oh and science, totally true too just missing a few facts.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpecialCircumstances" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpecialCircumstances">Princess of Wands</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a> has a kitchen sink approach to Religion, but The White God as he's known in the story is by far the most powerful. However the White God is said to be not only Yahweh and Jesus but also Allah and possibly all creator gods including that of Wicca.
<ul><li> In the second book, this is shown to be complicated. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the US is about to be eaten by a giant demon Blob</span>, the only thing that saves everyone is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the majority of the population praying to whatever deity they believe in, which convinces the White God they're worth saving</span>. It made clear it doesn't matter <em>what</em> deity they pray to, so long as it's either one of the aspects of the White God or one of the other deities considered to be on the side of good.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> is extremely ambiguous on the matter. Jesus is given the title of the "greatest light magician ever" by virtue of being the "Light itself" - the incarnation of the Light, one half of the Twilight. In other words, a Messiah. However, most Others, knowing that their afterlife is to dissolve back into the Twilight, are atheists; they don't believe in God as a being separate to the Light.
<ul><li> Not all of them. There is mention of an Other who is an Orthodox priest. He even tries to do some missionary work among the Others. He's not particularly successful, but he's there.
</li><li> In <em>Day Watch</em> there was even a <em>Dark</em> Other character who also happened to be a devout Christian, which shows either that there are some <em>very</em> conflicting interpretations of Jesus within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a> verse, or simply that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a>.
</li><li> Then you have <em>The Last Watch</em>, which basically claims that zero-level Others are the most powerful ever (this is the first time this is mentioned) and that Merlin was one of them, as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anton and Svetlana's young daughter</span>. What this, apparently, means is that Merlin was just as strong as Jesus. In fact, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nadya Gorodetskaya</span> is specifically referred to as the next Light Messiah, equating <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her</span> with Jesus.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WizardOfYurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WizardOfYurt">A Bad Spell In Yurt</a></em>, it is specifically pointed out that there are certain things that Jesus did (as well as angels and demons) that wizards cannot do. This is actually a plot point, as it helps the protagonist figure out that somebody's been communicating with demons: They're using "magic" which is beyond the capabilities of any wizard.
</li><li> A. Lee Martinez' <em>Divine Misfortune</em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossoverCosmology">every non-Abrahamic deity you could think of</a> and several completely fictional ones but no mention of any version of the Abrahamic god is made.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCWright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCWright">John C. Wright</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheDreaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheDreaming">War of the Dreaming</a></em> has deities from a plethora of pantheons but Jesus is never mentioned even though there are angels, specifically Uriel/Apollo and Lucifer. It is however hinted that Oberon had a hand in writing the Bible, at least the Old Testament, and Prometheus admits to being one of the angels mentioned as "laying with the daughters of men."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">Discussed</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a>,</em> where devoutly Catholic April is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a> where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a> from mythology walk around and scheme against each other. At one point she bitterly comments that these beings don't deserve to be called gods, even as she later goes through a crisis of faith, wondering if she trusts in them more than the Christian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> after she calls out to Athena to save her from falling and Athena does. She also refuses to sacrifice to the Orisha who pester them on their trip through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Everworld-Africa</a>. One of her companions, Jalil, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">an atheist</a> who similarly refuses to worship Everworld's gods, but at one point argues with April, apparently seeing her beliefs as hypocritical.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecretHistories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecretHistories">Secret Histories</a></em> series, magic, super-science, aliens and other dimensions are real, but Jesus is treated as the real deal because, even with all those things, truly bringing someone back from death is impossible. When Mr. Stab (an immortal serial killer who was originally Jack the Ripper) seeks to pull a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> after killing his latest female victim, he holds William, the Drood family librarian at knifepoint. Reasoning that the Droods, being the most powerful family on Earth both magically and technologically, will have the secrets by which he could resurrect his victims and atone for his crimes within their library, he demands to be told how to restore a dead person to life. William tells him that the best they can do is commune with a person's ghost or raise them as a zombie. Truly bringing them back from the grave? "Only one man could ever do that I think that we can definitely agree that you're not him!"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ra">Ra</a></em> magic is discovered in the modern age, but the narration specifically states that it is completely unlike any claimed magical abilities of earlier eras—in particular, it definitely has nothing to do with miracles attributed to Jesus or any other religious figures.

For most of the story, the question of whether there were parahumans before that is left ambiguous, as is the more general question of <em>why</em> people are getting powers at all.

Though Daniel at one point does point out that many modern religions associate fire with evil. And what do the Ori manifest as?
</li><li> Abrahamic religion very much gets this treatment; Eastern religion, however, not so much. We have Goa'uld for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology">Nirrti</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/HinduMythology">Kali</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/JapaneseMythology">Amaterasu</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ChineseMythology">Yu</a>. Moreover, Daniel Jackson outright says that Buddhism may be the result of Oma Desala helping humans to ascend when he first encounters her.
</li><li> They even handwave this one... they encounter a Goa'uld-run settlement that seems to follow medieval Christian rites (what with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">witch burning</a> and stuff). Teal'c is quick to point out that unlike all the other ones, this particular Goa'uld can't be the original because a Goa'uld is "not capable of the acts of love and compassion depicted in the Bible". He must have skipped the parts about jealousy, wrath and genocide. It ends up turning out the Goa'uld is impersonating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a></em>.
</li><li> It's worth noting that the Goa'uld were driven away from Earth long before the time Jesus was supposed to have lived.

As it is, it's a little suspicious that none of the Doctor's many, many companions has ever brought up the similarities. Although Jesus isn't said to have changed appearance when he came back to life, the way Time Lords do.
<ul><li> Although River comments that she hates hearing about kind wizards in fairytales, since they <em>always</em> turn out to be The Doctor.
</li><li> He has met Jesus, in fact. When aliens got the entire history of Christmas wrong, he explains it was nothing like that, "I was there." Of course, we could never get to see that meeting on screen. Ten also mentions having been to the first Easter. We never do find out from him what really happened, though, due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">Attention Deficit... Ooh, Shiny!</a> interrupting that train of thought.
</li><li> The Doctor fights a being who claims to be Satan in "The Impossible Planet" / "The Satan Pit". Interestingly, the crisis of faith he suffers during the episode is not due to following any kind of religion, but because "Satan" asserts that it had been bound on that world since <em>before</em> our universe began. While the Time Lords mastered travel between parallel universes, pocket universes, and had ventured from the beginning and end of our own, they never found any evidence that a universe could have existed before our own. The Doctor even goes so far to claim that even if one <em>had</em>, he believed it <em>impossible</em> that anything could have survived the collapse of reality before the Big Bang kickstarted it off again.
<ul><li> Funnily enough, though, his former companion Sarah Jane had no trouble believing that the Ancient Lights came from the pre-universe when they appeared in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSarahJaneAdventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a></em>.
</li><li> In the Expanded Universe, it's absolutely positive that there are beings from before our universe. The Guardians are among them (possibly the last surviving Time Lords from the previous universe), and even they have higher powers they defer to. If an Abrahamic creator God of this universe exists, he's less ultimate than the Guardians, and not that much more powerful than mortals like Rassilon or the Council of Eight or the Doctor (who were all able to rewrite the fundamental rules of this universe's reality, which ought to be no easier than writing the original rules).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodChildrenOfEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodChildrenOfEarth">Torchwood: Children of Earth</a></em>, reference is made to a religious woman who committed suicide after the public revelation of the existence of aliens, claiming that "Science has won".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodMiracleDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TorchwoodMiracleDay">Torchwood: Miracle Day</a></em> comes close to breaching the subject, but still never deals with it explicitly.
<ul><li> In the <em>Torchwood</em> universe it seems to be canon that there's no existence after death, which suggests that Jesus/Christianity/many religions are fake, but the series it branched off from and all other adaptions of the series have never confirmed that this is the case. Most likely because <em>Torchwood</em> was made to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> than its parent show, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> usually leans towards optimism and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a> or <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensDidIt">Aliens Did It</a>. So while fake!Jesus is implied in <em>Torchwood</em>, it's contradicted by the rest of the canon.
</li><li> The parent show may have a different answer about the afterlife, but it's definitely not the Christian one. It's hard to make sense of stories like, say, <em>Dark Water</em> if people are souls who go to Heaven and Hell rather than just some kind of process attached to their physical brains. (Of course in the Expanded Universe there are a ton of contradictory afterlifes, from Katarina going to Hades to everyone leaving "N-Forms" to live in "Null Space" after they die.)
</li><li> Meanwhile, in the Expanded Universe, Jesus was definitely a real person, and at least most of the things in the Gospel stories are true (and even non-Biblical myths like the Spear of Longinus), but the one question that's left open is the Resurrection.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FactionParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FactionParadox">Faction Paradox</a></em> spinoff has a technological afterlife <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> (the Doctor's former companion/TARDIS turns herself into a megacity at the end of the universe and resurrects every human who ever lived</span>). And Jesus is definitely there, but he's not sitting on a <em>Revelation</em>-style throne, he's just a carpenter and boatwright who tells the children stories and won't say whether he's the Son of God. And, even if he isn't, would a technologically-resurrected Jesus be the Son of God anyway, or just his human essence? That question leads to the Arian heresies and so on, so the author decided to leave it up to the reader.

They once had Leo and Piper gain the powers of the Hindu Gods. Piper even gets six arms, and fights demons with her goddess powers. And, the Greek gods were revealed to be humans empowered by whitelighters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, with the revelation that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifferentlyPoweredIndividual">"Heroes"</a> have been around much longer than anyone thought and that regeneration/self-resurrection is a power that popped up in at least two individuals. And people like Peter, who can basically do anything as the plot demands. There are some religious scenes in the series, such as weddings and funerals that take place in churches or temples. Nobody really brings up how their myriad superpowers would relate to miracles, though.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">Highlander</a></em>, a priest who discovers the Immortals also learns about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOfTheWeek">Villain of the Week</a>, who has a hobby of passing himself off as various gods, including in the present day, the Biblical one. But McLeod promptly assures the priest that the villain was born long after Jesus, and is the <em>only</em> immortal to have ever attempted this. Ever.
<ul><li> In <em>Highlander: The Source</em>, an Immortal Catholic priest is having an argument with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">Time Abyss</a> Methos, and mentions something from scripture, prompting Methos to quip that he <em>knew</em> Jesus, and so the priest shouldn't try to pull that with him.

However, it does touch on this trope in the episode "Requiem for Methuselah." The episode stars a very long-lived human who turned out to have been many famous people in the past. However, rather than be Jesus, he was actually Lazarus. Sure, it undermines one of Jesus's miracles, but the show neatly avoids questioning whether Jesus was just another long-lived human.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a>" gets around this by simply not mentioning Jesus at all. In a world where God, Satan, Demons, Angels, Heaven, Hell, Purgatory, the Bible, the Apocalypse, the Four Horsemen and a plethora of non-Judeo-Christian gods all exist, no one has ever asked in eleven seasons "Where is Jesus in all of this?" Not even the angels who have been looking for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">God</a> for over six seasons.

The Catholic Church is thus very careful when making saints, since they have to make a distinction between miracles and spells (even raising the dead just requires a skilled necromancer).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> is a game about the children of gods developing divine powers, eventually becoming gods themselves. Though there is mention in <em>Companion</em> of a group of Abrahamic-religion believers trying to rewrite all other religions into their framework, there is no other mention of it. Given the theoretical uproar if they tried to stat out Jesus, this is probably for the best.
<ul><li> Though there's some hints that Abrahamic God might be the Titan Aten. Whether he actually is or isn't is deliberately left to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">canonical doubt and uncertainty.</a>
</li><li> There's also the san greal (the Holy Grail). No-one's quite sure which pantheon it comes from; while it is part of Christian iconography, any Scion with a strong rating in the Piety Virtue can use it.
</li><li> Another likely candidate for the Abrahamic God is Logos, Titan of Logic, Reason and Order. It is highly likely that the material World was created due to its power and the gods never bound Logos since it was considered to be a highly benign Titan.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WitchGirlsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WitchGirlsAdventures">Witch Girls Adventures</a></em> doesn't even <em>try</em> to touch this one.

<p></p><h2>Aversions and subversions:</h2>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Averted in the manga version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em>- Jesus, Muhammad and Gautama Buddha are all listed as previous holders of the title "Shaman King". However, given that the Shaman King is actually a spirit-medium who communes directly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">The Great</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotUsingTheZWord">Spirit</a>, he's far from being "just" a wizard. For those (Muslims and others) willing to accept that Jesus was merely <em>communing with</em> God, this could be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallARabbitASmeerp">calling a prophet a shaman</a>.
</li><li> Averted in the first anime of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, in which it's strongly implied the discovery of alchemy pretty much killed off Christianity when anyone who studied for long enough could pull off miracles. Bumpkins in the sticks (for instance, in the first episode of the anime, or the first chapter of the manga) still mistake alchemy for miracles, though.
<ul><li> In the manga setting nothing has indicated Christianity has ever existed, though there's still local religious milieu with monotheistic beliefs. Alchemy may be related to the generally secular tone of Amestrian society. Fuehrer King Bradley is something of a militant atheist, which given his...family background...is understandable. <br/>The relation of 'God' and 'the Truth Guy,' who claims this as one of his identities, is addressed only in passing and only by our atheistic main character. The scientific world as understood by alchemists is not rigidly materialist in the way our scientific world is, since souls definitely exist, this surprises no one, and there is alchemy equipped to affect them, i.e. Al's blood seal. <br/>Ishbala's failure to protect his people in any way from the Amestrian genocide campaign is invoked on-site as a great reason not to convert. Bradley was promised that God would judge him; narration that might be either his or Roy's says, "God is something created by humans. Therefore, what will judge us is not God, but probably 'humans.'", Arakawa didn't need to hold back much.
</li><li> In the first anime it <em>was</em> implied a Christian society had existed and been destroyed and forgotten four hundred years previously, but only the trappings and none of the theology come up. On the other hand, in all versions the <em>inability</em> of alchemists to perform a successful resurrection when the soul of the original person 'does not exist in the world' is invoked as precisely why alchemists are <em>not</em> gods, even with the Philosopher's Stone. And that is the closest anyone really gets to a coherent eschatology in the setting.

<ul><li> Buddhism has a rather peculiar way with this trope. According to the Buddha, anyone who is shaping themselves for enlightenment will eventually gain supernatural powers, but it's actually a worldly distraction that prevents one from reaching true enlightenment. Therefore: If Wizard, Then Not Buddha.
<ul><li> On the other hand, Buddhism has been able to co-exist with theistic religions, usually by holding that while the gods exist, the gods themselves are on the same reincarnation cycle, being ones who are really close to Englightenment but got distracted to be gods.

<ul><li> Other sources state that he <em>co-opted</em> "certain ancient myths": by performing Jesus-like miracles, he passed himself off as Jesus; by having defeated something which might be the C'tan Void Dragon, that shows he was the basis of Saint George; etc. The fact that he was militantly anti-religious (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">ostensibly to deny the Chaos Gods worshippers</a>, but maybe so he wouldn't have any competition) could point to the fact that he was trying to discredit whatever religions still had some foothold on Earth before he expanded his reach to the stars.

</li><li> In the Steve Jackson Games version, the Game Master's Guide said that the game would never have Jesus appear or explain his nature. It also said that (a) The Archangel Gabriel prophesied his birth (b) Jesus performed miracles, similar to other prophets, and attracted some celestial attention (c) By the time he came to the attention of the Divine Inquisition he had already died (d) Most of the Archangels themselves don't know whether he was the Messiah or not (e) The Archangel Yves said he was important and encouraged other angels to support Christianity (f) Neither Gabriel nor Yves has said whether he was the Messiah or not.
<ul><li> There are some 'suggestions' for what Jesus was. Most popular is that Jesus was a role of the Archangel Eli, with evidence being that some of Eli's attunements are similar to Jesus' miracles. In game canon, Eli has abandoned heaven to roam the Earth, and Eli being Jesus would suggest he's getting ready to stage the second coming.

However, the version of the Koran that is in Heaven as 'the original' conflicts with the version of the Koran that appears on Earth written by Muhammad (exactly how is not said). Whether these changes were an accident, a manipulation by Muhammad, or deliberate changes made by the Archangel Gabriel (which would be grossly heretical) lead Dominic, the Archangel of Judgment, to put Gabriel on trial for potential heresy. The trial was inconclusive as Gabriel refused/could not tell what had happened and fled for her own domain. To attempt to bring Gabriel back would be civil war in heaven, so the trial was indefinitely postponed. Servitor angels of Fire and Judgment usually do <em>not</em> get along.

There is some in-universe speculation as to the nature of Jesus and his role in the supernatural world, but mages usually don't bother much with it, since they know the true nature of reality and become nigh-godlike themselves with enough <em>arete</em>.

Further <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">Zigzagged</a> when the AIM fields emitted by the Science Side's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">espers</a> are shown to crystallise into winged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a> in sufficient densities, suggesting that ancient naturally-ocurring espers may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodOfHumanOrigin">either created or transformed into gods</a>... though it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">left ambiguous</a> given that the process for artificially awakening esper powers was modelled on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Secret Art</a> for permanently imbuing a mage with the power of an archangel.
</li><li> Toyed with in Traci Harding's <em>Ancient Future Trilogy</em>. The notion that Jesus might have been one of the Chosen Immortals is brought up, but the cast decides not to pursue it due to the trickiness of the subject. Then addressed indirectly in the sequel trilogies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChroniclesOfChaos">Chronicles of Chaos</a></em>: In <em>Orphans of Chaos</em>, Thelxiepia the siren—who lives side by side with Greek gods, Titans and such—is capable of actually observing (with her multidimensional senses) a divine force reaching down "from above" when an early Christian saint performed a miracle, which led to her conversion to Christianity. Although, since this was in the first few centuries AD, it was to Donatism—a now extinct Christian group—except for herself (being immortal). She also states that some of the other Greek myth types believe Jesus was a little-g god rather like themselves.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfAlvinMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTalesOfAlvinMaker">The Tales of Alvin Maker</a></em> series, Alvin is the first Maker in two thousand years, a power he received from being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSeventhSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSeventhSon">seventh son of a seventh son</a> and the thirteenth child of a thirteenth child. It's strongly implied that Jesus Christ was the last Maker. But there is no mention if Jesus had six sisters and six brothers, or if he got his power a different way, say being the child of a virgin. Similarly, it's strongly implied that Alvin's powers are beyond the magic seen in the world and that they go into holy as well. Alvin even faces a whispering corrupting force called the Unmaker.
<ul><li> Since Alvin is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of Joseph Smith, his origin story is an explanation for <em>prophets</em>, not the savior/second coming. Though the distinction may seem somewhat trivial to a non-Christian, Jesus being actually significantly less overtly powerful than several of the prophets preceding him in the Bible.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda">Matilda</a></em>, Miss Honey speculates that Matilda's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a> may be divine in origin. We never really find out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickRiordan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickRiordan">Rick Riordan</a> features countless ancient deities in his stories, but repeatedly distinguishes between polytheistic gods and a monotheistic God. Riordan evidently considers the Big G too big and metaphysical to explore beyond "if God does exist, He's on a much higher plane of existence than the petty deities of ancient mythology."
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em>, Percy finds out that the gods of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> actually exist. He then proceeds to ask about the capital-G <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCentaursAreDifferent">Chiron</a> then dismisses that question as "metaphysical" and claims that the existence of the Greek gods is a "much smaller matter." However, later in the same book, when we see a corrupt televangelist in the Underworld:
<div class="indent">"But if he's a preacher," [Percy] said, "and he believes in a different hell...."
</div><div class="indent">Grover shrugged. "Who says he's seeing this place the way we're seeing it? Humans see what they want to see. You're very stubborn—er, persistent, that way."
</div></li></ul><dl><dt> </dt><dd> In addition, the story "The Son of Magic" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemigodDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDemigodDiaries">The Demigod Diaries</a></em>, shows Hecate, the goddess of magic, praying in a Christian Church. Though <em>what</em> exactly she was doing is never told, it's implied she is praying to God.
</dd></dl><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em> establish that Moses was actually a magician. On top of that, a comment from Bes in <em>The Throne of Fire</em> suggests that one of his miracles, the parting of the Red Sea, was something any magician from Ancient Egypt could've done. Although gods are manifestly real, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMythsAreTrue">All Myths Are True</a>, and Moses was apparently so powerful that he was the only outsider ever to best the House of Life, so it certainly can be said to work anyway.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MagnusChaseAndTheGodsOfAsgard">Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard</a></em>:

Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam">Islam</a> has only one true God, Sam interprets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse</a> deities not as actual gods, but as powerful magical spirits akin to the Islamic concept of angels and jinn. Heimdall, Guardian of the Bifrost, also believes this interpretation.
</li><li> The title character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">Flat-Earth Atheist</a>. Being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality">einherjar warrior</a>, Magnus acknowledges the obvious existence of Norse gods, but he doesn't believe that a capital-g God exists.
</li><li> Additionally, in the first book, there is a joke involving Thor challenging Jesus to a fight. Whether or not this means Jesus is real is up for interpretation.

Since pagan gods still exist and have some form of power in this universe, even though much of the major mythology the show is based on is Christian, it was unknown if Loki was always Gabriel in hiding or if Gabriel took over the role from the original Loki until Loki showed up in a later season and made it clear it was the later. However, it's still unknown how many of the myths about Loki are really about him and how many are about Gabriel</span>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>, events that might be miracles occur on a couple of occasions, but there's always a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">possible mundane explanation for them</a>. In keeping with the game's theme, it's always ultimately left up to the player to decide whether to believe the mundane or the miraculous explanation.
<ul><li> At one point the character Wynne speculates that the Jesus-equivalent Andraste might have secretly been a mage as mages were capable of routinely performing all the various miracles that were attributed to her. (You can also find a book making this claim in Orzammar, whose description says it was saved from a fire.) Since the Chantry was founded as a rebellion against an oppressive magocracy and has very strict rules to keep mages from ever ruling over non-mages again, this is considered a rather drastic heresy.
<ul><li> This is further hurt in the eyes of the Thedasian public because it is the Holy Canon of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRemnant">The Remnant</a> of said Magocracy, which has come to follow Andraste themselves (although the Southern Chantry would say they follow Andraste <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>).
</li><li> On the other hand, it's not that unreasonable to assume that Andraste could have been a mage, but despised other mages who abused the non-mages, thus forming a rebellion against them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolyGrail">Urn of Sacred Ashes</a> can restore the dying to perfect health with just a pinch of Andraste's ashes. This could be the Maker acting in the world...or it could be because the Urn has rested for centuries on a giant vein of lyrium.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JeanneDArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JeanneDArchetype">Leliana</a> receives a vision of the Grey Warden's coming, prompting her to join up with him/her. It could have been a message from the Maker...or it could have just been a lucky hallucination. When she describes the vision it's incredibly vague, she just interpreted it that way.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the <em>Legacy DLC</em> is Corypheus, an Ancient Tevinter Magister <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and one of the first Darkspawn</span>. It's heavily implied that he was one of those responsible for entering the Golden City of the Maker, but rather than corrupting it with their evil as stated by the Chantry, he claims that the Black City was <em>already</em> abandoned and tainted by unknown forces before they arrived. While (apparently) confirming that at least <em>some</em> of the story was true, this leaves the mystery of what caused the Black City <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and the creation of the Darkspawn</span> even more ambiguous, as well as whether the Maker supposedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveYouSeenMyGod">abandoning humanity</a> was even <em>His</em> choice?
<ul><li> In the next game there's even a scene where the games resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Token Tevinter team member</a> becomes very distraught because he did think that it was all just superstition, only to find out that no, his people in fact almost did bring about the end of the world.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>: On one hand, most characters don't know of Christianity (which makes sense in the setting) and ask questions such as "who is that?" when Jesus is brought up, though they actually don't seem to particularily care who he was. On the other hand, the one character who <em>does</em> talk about Christianity is a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic">Wicked</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermitGuru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermitGuru">Hermit</a>" who dresses up as Santa Claus and leaves presents for children but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadSanta">steals valuable stuff from the places she visits</a> as payment for said gifts. On top of that, said Hermit also considers the feats of Jesus completely unimpressive and thinks that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlasphemousPraise">her student resurrecting from a 1,000 year long death is much grander</a> than the resurrection "that prophet" pulled off a few measly days after his execution.
<ul><li> Answering the question is done in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastComer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLastComer">The Last Comer</a></em>, a fan-game with an expectedly female Jesus at the end. Turns out that Jesus has an ability like any other, it just so happens that her ability to "turn water into wine" is just as broken as any other abstract power in Touhou (wine is considered Christ's sacred blood, and since there is tons of water around us and we are also mostly made of water...). She also doesn't particulary emphasize being God's child.

A strong Christian character has realized she always had magical powers and just overlooked them. Praying for guidance one day she asks outright if he was like her, but she still prays to him. Indeed she could be argued to pray even more ardently when she <a class="urllink" href="http://talesfromthevault.com/thunderstruck/comic239.html">realizes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that perhaps he understands what she's going through all too well.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.itswalky.com/d/20030601.html">Discussed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ItsWalky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ItsWalky">It's Walky!</a></em>. Alien abducted SEMME agents were given a variety of superhuman powers, and martian technology can do things like resurrect the dead. Joyce remains a devoted Christian despite the fact that, as her boss points out, Jesus didn't do anything they couldn't do.
