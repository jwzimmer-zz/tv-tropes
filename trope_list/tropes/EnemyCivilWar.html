Oh, sure, they partake in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHedonist">decadent luxury</a> while oppressing the weak, but all in all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> is pretty darn <em>orderly</em> when you get right down to it. Dissent against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> is squashed easily, but no one really disagrees to begin with. (The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Defector from Decadence</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">protests a lot</a> doesn't count.)
</p><p>This is usually because an enemy faction is rarely if at all fleshed out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlikeAndAntitheticalAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlikeAndAntitheticalAdversaries">making them appear completely homogeneous</a>, but naturally the more information we get about these guys the more interesting they become. A side effect of this can lead to an Enemy Civil War. Rather than wait for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to keel over, one or more factions in the evil empire break off and start fighting the main group for power. Note, nowhere in that sentence was there a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>. The second group <em>may</em> do such, but it's likelier they'll simply be either slightly less evil than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">"loyalists"</a>, or at the least more open to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> with the heroes (or, alternately, they'll be complaining that the Evil Overlord isn't evil <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">enough</a></em>.) For extra fun, the factions may take turns trying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a>.
Speaking of the heroes, they'll be overjoyed at getting a breather or ally against their enemies. Interestingly, though an Enemy Civil War does weaken the bad guys overall, it is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainDecay">Villain Decay</a> and can in fact forestall it, as bad guy on bad guy action gives the good guys a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaPreservingHandicap">justified reduced difficulty</a> in upcoming fights. Just imagine how powerful the evil army will be next time when there <em>isn't</em> a civil war!

</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamZZ">Gundam ZZ</a></em>, where an upstart faction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">Neo Zeon</a> attempts a coup against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Haman Karn</a>.

</li><li> Something similar happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em>, as two of the highest ranking living Titans briefly struggle for control of the organization at the end of the series after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jamitov is killed by Scirocco</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em> went a different route. Treize resigns as commander-in-chief OZ in protest at the imminent introduction of unmanned mobile dolls. He is placed under house-arrest in his headquarters in Luxembourg, but OZ's military units who agree with his ideals remain loyal to him, quickly leading to all-out war between OZ and the "Treize Faction" throughout Earth Sphere.
<ul><li> Another prominent example is OZ's orchestrated <em>coup d'etat</em> against the United Earth Sphere Alliance military in the early episodes. Most of the Alliance either surrendered due to the confusion and heavy losses (since OZ made up their high-end military industry, their training academies, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Special Forces branch</a>), and the few who held out were eventually destroyed by OZ forces.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Mobile Fighter G Gundam</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Master Asia and Wong</span>.

</li><li> It is implied that it is precisely this that maintains the tenuous Balance of Power in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> world. Lack of unity is the only thing that keeps the Yonkou (the four strongest pirates in the <em>One Piece</em> world) from becoming an even greater threat than they are already. This can also apply to a lesser extent to the other half of the Balance: The Marines and the Shichibukai, and even amongst the Shichibukai <em>themselves</em>, as it's stated at one point the mere idea of a group of Shichibukai fighting as a team was unthinkable.
<ul><li> The Marines are the faction with the greatest unity, following the rule of "Absolute Justice". However, it's clear that some of the officers don't give a crap about justice and just want the perks that come with their power. Then there are those Marines that don't follow "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Absolute Justice</a>" but follow their own personal brand of "Justice" (usually called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Moral Justice</a>" but some characters develop their own, such as Aokiji's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Lazy Justice</a>"), such as Admiral Aokiji and Captain/Commodore/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vice-Admiral</span> Smoker.
</li><li> Subverted come the Wano Arc. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The World Government and the Marines boot out the Shichibukai once they become a <em>major</em> liability, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">Big Mom and Kaido team up</a> for being former crewmates and having a common enemy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagneticHero">Luffy</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em>, the Five Retainers who lead the Mazoku can't <em>stand</em> one another. Chaos Dragon is openly in rebellion against the others and devotes all his energy to ruining their plans. Hellmaster has lost faith in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Dark Lord Shabranigdu's</a> ability to end the world and wants to do it himself. Dynast, on the other hand, wants to immediately resurrect Shabranigdu for another go at it. Greater Beast loathes Hellmaster for always bossing her around, but also thinks that Dynast's plan is too reckless. Deep Sea has her <em>own</em> plan, thank you very much, and isn't happy when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">other plans get in the way</a>.

<ul><li> Arguably the most protracted civil war occurred in the Marvel UK "Earthforce" storyline, where two Decepticon factions led by Megatron and Shockwave are active on Earth and spend most of their time fighting each other. The Autobots are happy to encourage this: When the two factions hold peace talk, the Autobots quickly get them fighting again by making it look like Shockwave set the whole thing up to assassinate Megatron. It eventually ends with their respective lieutenants, Soundwave and (naturally) Starscream, deposing their leaders and uniting the factions themselves.

<ul><li> This is also somewhat of an exception as The (People's) Republic of Haven is quite fleshed out, at least leading up to the second coup. Later books actually feature Havenite <em>protagonists</em> among the confusingly large ensemble cast.

In fact, the two occasions when the moredhel united completely under a single banner were quite memorable.
</li><li> Plenty of examples in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In the <em>Star Wars: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthBane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DarthBane">Darth Bane</a></em> trilogy by Drew Karpyshyn, the main character, Darth Bane, recognizes this as both the Sith's main strength and greatest weakness. While the in-fighting culled the weak from the Sith Order, it also allowed many weaker Sith to band together and defeat a more powerful Sith Master, with each Sith taking a portion of the Master's knowledge, weakening the order as a whole. Darth Bane solved this by creating the Rule of Two: one master to embody the power, the apprentice to crave it. That way the in-fighting would result in only the stronger Sith coming out ahead, leading to the advancement of the Sith as a whole. It was reasonably successful in the end, as it took over 1000 years, but the Sith (under Darth Sidious) were able to defeat the long-standing incarnation of the Jedi Order.
<ul><li> That being said, very few Sith lords seem to actually follow the rule of two. Secret apprentices, apprentices with their own apprentices, and at one point a full order of Sith all existed after the rule, since, unsurprisingly, most Sith lords aren't big on following rules.
</li><li> Although, Banes original vision also exists to establish a way for the methodology to right itself in times of deviancy, given that the Rule of Two exists to protect the Sith from the inevitable infighting damning the whole organization. With anyone that exists outside the framework of one apprentice to one master, they are working towards whittling down the organization back to the core two, and it will resume once the deviant elements are culled through the natural order of Sith tradition (in short, once enough errant Sith figures are killed by one another, the last two will settle into the proper relationship to push the Sith as a whole forward). The only real issue is if one of them goes off the rails entirely and abandons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Imperial Remnant in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> fights among themselves <strike>almost</strike> at least as often as they do with the New Republic.
</li><li> Grand Admiral Zaarin's and Grand Moff Trachta's actually attempted to usurp power from Palpatine <em>during</em> his reign. Neither succeeded.
</li><li> This actually led to the crowning moment that turned Pellaeon from Thrawn's apprentice into his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>. He and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">Daala</a> manage to get about 10 of the more powerful imperial warlords together and give them 1 hour to work out an alliance. When that (predictably) fails, they kill off all of the other warlords and instantly become the most powerful leaders of the Remnant.
<ul><li> Except competent Pallaeon, though appreciative of it, had nothing to do with the plan—it was <em>entirely</em> Daala's idea, to the point where he was shocked when it happened. Quite startling given her general role as a whipping girl for <em>Star Wars</em> literature.
</li></ul></li><li> This is, in fact, the main reason the Empire falls in the first place. As several characters have observed, even after the defeat at Endor, the Empire still had more than enough raw power to maintain control of the galaxy. The problem is that without the Emperor and Darth Vader to hold it together, this trope comes into play with a vengeance. On the one hand, you have a number of senior officers and politicians breaking off from the Empire and becoming independent warlords, which are as big a headache for the Empire proper as the Rebels. On the other hand, the remaining Imperial government is paralyzed by a power struggle between Sate Pestage (the Emperor's successor), a "cabal" of his rivals looking to overthrow him, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">State Sec</a> boss Ysanne Isard who plays the two factions against each other to ultimately take power for herself. Not only are those factions more interested in fighting each other than the Rebels, they're even willing to hand victories to the Rebels if they think that doing so will weaken their rivals. By the time Daala and Pellaeon manage to reunify the various Imperial factions under their control, what's left of the Empire is already a rump state living in the shadow of the New Republic.
</li><li> Nom Anor and his constant machinations against the Yuuzhan Vong leadership. His revolution continued <em>even after he abandoned it.</em>
</li><li> Admiral Niathal's betrayal of Jacen Solo... er... <em>Darth Caedus</em>. Niathal is a real vicious piece of work, and in the end, the best thing that could be said about her is that she has marginally higher moral scruples than an insane Sith Lord.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, all evil is ultimately under Sauron's control, but rivalry between Orc forces is still very common, as their race is literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>. In <em>The Two Towers</em>, the constant squabbling between the Orcs from Isengard, Mordor, and the Misty Mountains eventually leads to their captives Merry and Pippin escaping, while in <em>Return of the King</em>, the Mordor Orcs of Minas Morgul and the Tower of Cirith Ungol decimate each other fighting over Frodo's treasure, allowing Sam to rescue him. It's also pretty clear that if Saruman had gotten his hands on the Ring, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">he'd have turned against Sauron in an instant</a>, but thankfully that never came to pass.
<ul><li> The trope is discussed and somewhat deconstructed when one of the characters wishes that Sauron and Saruman weren't situated so far apart so they could spend all their energy fighting each other instead of the rest of Middle Earth. Gandalf points out that that would only mean whoever won would be stronger than ever and free of any distractions.
</li><li> In the book Saruman effectively betrayed Sauron as soon as he made it clear that he too was hunting for the Ring. Gandalf even comments how his task is easier at one point, because Sauron's eye is fixed on Isengard, instead of his activities. In the movie this double treachery doesn't seem to come to pass.
<ul><li> In the book, the eponymous <em>Two Towers</em> were Saruman's Orthanc in the first part, and Minas Morgul, in the second part. But because Minas Morgul isn't shown until the <em>third</em> movie, Peter Jackson had to justify the title by making Sauron's Barad-dûr the second tower. This meant he had to emphasize "the alliance of the Two Towers" and forget about Saruman's treachery.
</li></ul></li><li> In fact this is subverted with Mordors orcs: While Uglúk and Grishnak really were from different factions, the Mordor orcs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">work under the Nazgûl and some of them guard the path to Shelobs lair</a> and when the pressure from their superiors is enough, they fight themselves. Even so, Gorbag lampshades to Shagrat that they need to be together against the Free People:

Things really came to a head, though, when the Armies of the West go to distract the Angarak forces from what Garion, Silk and Belgarath are doing, only to find out too late that the Murgos and Malloreans would have just as happily beaten upon each other due to their rabid hatred of one another.

</li><li> There have been three major conflicts between East and West; in the first, the Angaraks hadn't split into different nations yet and were lead by the Grolims, but the war put the generals of the army in charge, and in the aftermath the military and the priesthood had a decades-long power struggle and tried to wipe each other out, until Torak ordered them into two separate cities. During the second, the Murgos and Malloreans, under the leadership of two of Torak's co-Dragons (who truly despised one another), were literally killing each other in their sleep during the march.

The protagonists are a tight-knit family who trusts each other, they have an actual <em>Goddess</em> actively working on their side, and their commanders and armies are loyal and efficient. They also have a house that can open doors to literally anywhere and is infinitely large, allowing all sorts of munchkin tactics. The antagonists are (intended to be) counterparts to the protagonists in all ways (including similar roles and powers), but they're openly distrustful and fight among themselves, actively encourage ancient and obsolete tactics and equipment (including <em>flintstone weapons</em>), command their soldiers through fear, their god won't help them very much at all, and their house is a hellish firepit that everyone is afraid of and won't use to its full potential. Is it just me, or did the Eddings have a fondness for stacking the deck?

A group of saboteurs led by an OSS agent use a stolen NKVD uniform to get close to the targets they are trying to destroy, purely because Soviet soldiers in general will let NKVD officers do whatever they please. But the general commanding the Soviet unit, once he learns of an NKVD officer destroying his supplies, assumes that the high command is trying to set him up for failure, because he is Armenian rather than Russian - an assumption he considers confirmed when one of the saboteurs uses the uniform to get close enough to try to assassinate him. Once recovered from his wounds, the general returns to his some country and starts a civil war against the Soviet Union, something that the saboteurs did not intend to do, but their superiors ultimately approve of.

However, the angels engaged in a massive civil war with one faction wanting to restart the Apocalypse and the other trying to stop it. A few seasons later the angels fought themselves into near-extinction. The demons tried to capitalize on this but they started fighting among each other as well. Crowley made himself King of Hell but had to constantly fight off attacks from demons who wanted to either seize the throne for themselves or to free Lucifer so he can lead them. When Lucifer is finally freed, he has to fight both Crowley and Asmodeus, a Prince of Hell who got tired of sitting on the sidelines and decided to seize power for himself.

</li><li> To expand on the story about the revolution in Hell, known as the Reckoning: The King of Hell is Asmodeus; his two most powerful archdukes are Baalzebul and Mephistopheles. These two each wanted to rule Hell, so they gathered the remaining six archdevils into two factions that made war on each other, the winner taking on Asmodeus. When they had done enough damage to each other, one of the archdevils, Geryon, revealed he had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> for Asmodeus the whole time and gave the signal for the legions of Hell to turn against their masters. In the end, all the archdevils were sent back to their domains, except Geryon, whom Asmodeus exiled for being blindly loyal to him—turns out being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">The Starscream</a> is what Asmodeus expects of his vassals, and Geryon was the only one who was found wanting.
<ul><li> This page is about interesting enemies so one of the suspected reasons Asmodeus did what he did with Geryon is that he replaced him with Levistus (who did not get the usual power boost with the promotion nor get freed from his iceberg prison), a devil who had killed Asmodeus's queen, and the most blatant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarScream">StarScream</a> possibly bar Mephistopheles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">This was to make the leaders of hell scratch their heads, causing them to completely ignore that he had made a non-devil, the hag countess in charge of the sixth layer</a> of hell, that is until the throne warmer was replaced with his daughter, who he was not getting along with previously. Much to Levistus's despair all his plots only furthered to distract the other lords from Asmodeus's throne warmer.
</li><li> Completely off topic for this page, but recent information suggests that exiling Geryon for being loyal was just a front; Asmodeus is playing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> with Geryon to get him to do something that even the King of Hell can't be seen as being connected to.
</li></ul></li><li> Although it is never implied in the books, we must keep in mind these are devils, only a fool would expect one to be truly loyal, therefore Geryon's fate might be a lesson to other subordinates that everyone is disposable.
<ul><li> Asmodeus loves this; in a recent book; it was explained that the previous King of Hell; Lucifer; was simply a different avatar of the same Overlord that Asmodeus is <em>also</em> an avatar of. Asmodeus "rebelled" against Lucifer; in the most elaborate game of puppetry ever; to keep the devils on their toes.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This is specifically why the world isn't dead yet in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChroniclesOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChroniclesOfDarkness">Chronicles of Darkness</a>. Most notable is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em>, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientConspiracy">Ancient Conspiracy</a> known as the Seers of the Throne is constantly trying to keep its own groups from wiping each other out in power struggles and focus on the <em>other</em> mages - a lesson the Seers learned the hard way early in their history, when a squabble over how best to operate went hot, led to meaningful casualties, and gave the scattered Diamond, fresh from the fall of Atlantis, time to regain its footing.
</li><li> The factions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGAme/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGAme/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> can be divided roughly into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order and Disorder</a>, and since even the good races like the elves, dwarfs and Empire have had their share of civil wars, you can imagine what life is like among the others. Followers of Chaos compete violently amongst each other for the attention of their patron deities, the Skaven suffer from racial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>, and the Orcs and Goblins will just as eagerly fight each other than they would the other races - in fact, Greenskin armies have the Animosity rule that gives their troops a chance to ignore orders and shoot at a nearby friendly unit, squabble amongst themselves and do nothing for a turn, or surge ahead and try to get into close combat.
</li><li> About the only race in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> that <em>isn't</em> engaging in infighting are the Tau, and even they are trying to decide what to do with the separatist movement led by the renegade Commander "Farsight" O'Shovah.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Imperium</a> has suffered from numerous civil wars, from the disastrous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HorusHeresy">Horus Heresy</a> shortly after its founding to the more recent Age of Apostasy. At any given moment there's a dozen systems somewhere fighting a war of succession, especially given the breakdowns in communication and space travel at the close of the 41st millennium.
</li><li> The only reason the Orks haven't conquered the galaxy yet (and they almost did, once) is because they, like their <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> counterparts, enjoy fighting each other as much as they do outsiders. Occasionally a strong-willed Warlord emerges to browbeat his rivals into following him on a Waaagh!, but such rampages inevitably end in Warbosses breaking off to start their own dreams of conquest - or power struggles over who should be Warlord.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Tyranid</a> hive fleets have been observed battling with each other, but a true civil war is impossible as all Tyranids are controlled by the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>. What's actually going on is that the "rival" fleets are testing the evolutionary upgrades they've accumulated against each other to see which is stronger - the "winner" absorbs the genetic advantages of the "loser" and recycles the dead bio-mass to produce more soldiers, so there is minimal downside to such battles.
</li><li> Chaos, as befitting a faction represented by eight arrows going in different directions, is terminally fractious from top to bottom. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">four</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateEvil">Chaos Gods</a> despise each other on a fundamental level and spend most of their efforts on wars in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">Immaterium</a> rather than the material plane. Meanwhile their mortal followers have not only inherited these hatreds but are also battling against rival champions of their patron deity, to prove they're worthy of their favour. Though at times the forces of Chaos have marched in step, like the Ork Waaagh! example above, such Black Crusades are merely temporary alliances between rival Chaos warlords that invariably end when their vicious rivalries resurface.

Indeed, Chaos agents attempt to assassinate him. It is also observed that the aforementioned conflict may have caused more casualties among the Chaos forces than the entire Imperial Crusade up to that point.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamMcNeill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrahamMcNeill">Graham McNeill</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ultramarines">Ultramarines</a></em> novel <em>Dead Sky Black Sun</em>, there is fighting between two factions of a single Chaos Marine legion where Uriel arrives, and both sides are quite willing to use him against each other rather than stand united against him. Also, two major daemons of Khorne, apparently out of jealousy.
</li></ul></li><li> Even the Inquisition gets in on this, due to having multiple factions having very divergent goals and methods. The main one is the rift between Puritans and Radicals, where Puritans have no truck with fundamentally dangerous methods like psykers and Chaos artifacts, Radicals get better results due to using them but are at a much higher risk of falling to Chaos themselves. The two see each other as willingly blind fools/confirmed heretics and treat each other accordingly.
</li></ul></li><li> In promotional material for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> set <em>New Phyrexia</em>, it's suggested that the five Phyrexian factions' differing ideals may be sufficient to bring them down through infighting. Meanwhile, the Mirrans seem to have adopted a "now we are one" stance (a typically Phyrexian ideal), banding together to survive the corruption of their world.
</li><li> This is what effectively brings the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Clans</a> down as a threat to the Inner Sphere in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>. While they claim to have a united front against the Inner Sphere and call for its invasion and the capture of Terra (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">so that they can rule the Inner Sphere instead</a>, never you mind that no one save Comstar recognizes this as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">Instant-Win Condition</a>), the Clans turn out to be so heavily opposed to each other politically that they spend almost as much time fighting themselves as they do fighting the Inner Sphere. This ultimately comes to a head when the Clans' infighting causes them to lose not only massive amounts of material and countless lives, but also what advantages they held over a severely battered Inner Sphere, post-Fedcom Civil War and Jihad. The Clans divided themselves further, as the Home Clans abjured the Clans the moved into the Inner Sphere. This latter followed when Clan Steel Viper started calling in Trials of Reaving in which they would eliminate Clans they deem as tainted. The other Clans used these Trials to their own agenda in attack other Clans, while fighting off The Society a dissenting faction that plans to over throw the Warrior castes.
<ul><li> On that note, depending on which faction the reader may favor, various Successor States have at one time or another suffered a civil war. For instance, the Federated Commonwealth had half of it split off as the Lyran Alliance; eventually both halves went to war with the other over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">behavior of Katrina nee Katherine Steiner-Davion</a>. This was a boon to pretty much all the other factions in the Inner Sphere, who had long either warred with or at least viewed with suspicion the Federated Commonwealth or Lyran Alliance. The Capellan Confederation was particularly fortunate in this regard, seeing both the Federated Suns and the Free Worlds League, their neighbors and enemies for the longest times, <em>both</em> dissolve into brutal civil wars in the course of the game's timeline.
</li><li> It's reasonable to consider the entire Word of Blake Jihad as an Enemy Civil War that started between Comstar and their splinter faction Word of Blake. As not a lot of factions in-universe were all that fond of either the secretive Comstar or the fanatical Word of Blake, they probably viewed this as an Enemy Civil War to start, albeit that blew up and out of control to include the entire Inner Sphere when the second Star League was dissolved.
</li></ul></li><li> It is only <em>beginning</em> to happen (it's at the 'Enemy Civil Skirmishes' stage, so to speak), but the approach of this trope is one of the few good things for humanity in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSReignOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSReignOfSteel">GURPS Reign of Steel</a> (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Robot War</a> setting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">where the robots won</a>). The supercomputers may have been united when they toppled humanity as rulers of the Earth and carved it into Zones ruled by a single supercomputer each, but ideological differences have led to increasing tensions between the supercomputers, to the point that some of them are starting to consider whether having a 'human zone' as a neighbour wouldn't be better after all (and then there are ticking time-bombs like Zaire's infiltrators provocateur (who are the single reveal of where they come from from starting an open conflict with Washington) and Mexico City's secret plans to exterminate all organic life on Earth (which puts it in direct ideological or dependency conflict with no less than <em>six</em> (maybe even seven) of the other supercomputers)).

<ul><li> There's an island called Warburg that was formerly under Rogue Isles (Arachnos) control, but became a splinter faction under the control of Marshal Blitz. Mechanically, this means that it's the only non-faction-based PvP zone in the game; villains can fight villains, and heroes can fight heroes.

</li><li> The tangled history of the Council and the 5th Column: The 5th originally split off from the Council, and many years later was violently reabsorbed. Requiem, the old leader of the 5th, has never been happy as part of the Council, plotting against his fellows and working to ensure the re-emergence of the 5th.

Basically, ONI sends a squad of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">ODSTs</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Spartan</a>, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">crazy AI</a> to Sanghelios (the Elite homeworld) in order to fuel the fires of a civil war in order to keep them unbalanced while the UNSC rebuilds (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">all of this is without the approval or even knowledge of UNSC High Command</a>). However, Sanghelios's most prominent leader, the Arbiter, is already trying to get his people to <em>not</em> attack humanity; all ONI is doing is making his job harder. The sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaloTheThursdayWar">Halo: The Thursday War</a></em> shows that events don't go as planned by ONI. The ONI-backed Elites don't get enough support but still start the fight, but it looks like the Arbiter is going to win. However, the Arbiter then permits the above-mentioned team to enter a Forerunner relic on Sanghelios in order to retrieve a human scientist captured by the rebels. This ends up turning a large portion of the Sangheili against the Arbiter, and it looks like the rebels may win in a very short while. This is also not the result ONI wants, as the rebels are religious fanatics who hate the humans with a passion. Admiral Margaret Parangosky, the head of ONI, convinces Admiral Terrence Hood to bring UNSC <em>Infinity</em>, the fleet's newest flagship and the most powerful vessel in known space, to Sanghelios and rain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">Death from Above</a> on the fanatics.

</li><li> Civil wars abound in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftII">Warcraft II</a></em>, Gul'dan betrays the Horde on the eve of their victory by taking off with the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans to search for the Tomb of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDevil">Sargeras</a>. While this still left plenty of troops for Orgrim Doomhammer's siege of the Capital City of Lordaeron, Orgrim chooses honor over victory and sends the Blackrock clan, which constitutes a good third of the Horde forces, after the renegades. With the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">Alliance</a> army about to arrive and box him in, Orgrim is forced to call a retreat so close to victory<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22h9u');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22h9u" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22h9u');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this is <em>not</em> what happened in the actual game — the Horde actually <em>wins</em> at Lordaeron despite having to send off forces after Gul'dan in the Horde campaign, and in the Alliance campaign the Horde never reaches Lordaeron's capital, but the expansion and then <em>III</em> went with a blend of both campaigns having canonically happened, with the Alliance ending taking precedence in an inverse of how Warcraft <em>I</em> was handled.</span>. Furthermore, the battle between the renegades and the Blackrock clan results in the complete destruction or the renegade clans through sheer attrition (the orcs aren't known for their battle tactics). The seriously reduced Blackrock clan is further devastated by Admiral Proudmore's surprise attack at sea, leaving only a few thousand clan members alive. The war goes pretty much downhill for the orcs at this point. Even killing the supreme commander of the Alliance forces doesn't help, as Lothar's place is immediately taken by Turalyon.
</li><li> The Orcs as a whole, who made up the bulk of the Horde in the days of <em>Warcraft</em> and <em>Warcraft II</em>, were serving as pawns of demonic controllers until they broke out of their bondage just before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>.
</li><li> The Blood Elves originally split from the Alliance during <em>Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</em> after deciding they'd had enough abuse from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racist Human commander</a>. Later on, the Blood Elves had their own schism, after discovering that their leader and his forces defected to the same demonic controllers that had the Orcs under their thumbs.
</li><li> Illidan's forces <em>also</em> split from the Burning Legion.
</li><li> The Scourge were once the Burning Legion's second choice of pawns after they lost their reins on the Orcs. However, they too have turned against their demonic overlords.
</li><li> The Forsaken are a faction of the Scourge who rebelled against the Lich King, reclaimed their free will, and now help the Horde fight their former undead fellows. It's arguable how "good" they are, as the race as a whole is <em>at least</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">dark</a>, with a few redemption/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireRefugee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireRefugee">cure seekers</a>, while others either actively bask in evil or revel in their undead natures.
</li><li> The Forsaken later undergo <em>another</em> internal civil war during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> expansion <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> traitors under the dreadlord Varimathras unleash the Forsaken's secret plague weapon against both the Scourge and against <em>everyone</em> attacking the Lich King, and nearly kill the Forsaken queen Sylvanas Windrunner to boot. This conveniently acts a cathartic experience to solidify the relatively "loyal" Forsaken to the service of the Horde, purging the nasty hints that have foreshadowed the race's untrustworthiness from the very beginning of the game</span>.
</li><li> Also, the Death Knights of the Ebon Blade. After being freed from the Lich King's control, the Death Knights vowed to take vengeance on Arthas and use their unholy powers against him. However, they're still met with distrust and fear by the other factions, and the Ebon Blade's interests don't necessarily coincide with their allies' at times.
</li><li> This is happening to the Horde in <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>; which is unusual in that it's a player faction, but it is an <em>Enemy</em> Civil War in the eyes of the Alliance. With Garrosh passing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> by dropping a mana bomb on Theramore and only getting worse as time goes on, Baine and Vol'jin have begun expressing doubts about Garrosh. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vol'jin is later attacked by Garrosh's personal Kor'kron guard and left to die.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Gallywix</a>, meanwhile, seems intent to please Garrosh in <em>Tides of War</em>, and as of patch 5.1 the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">blood elf purge in Dalaran</span> has pushed Lor'themar and the blood elves farther away from Garrosh than ever; in fact, in 5.2, Lor'themar is specifically looking for a weapon to use against Garrosh. 5.3 confirms Sylvanas is on Vol'jin's side, but it remains to be seen where Ji Firepaw will end up in the conflict.
<ul><li> Meanwhile, King Varian has been watching the events of 5.3 while preparing his navy for an attack on Orgrimmar. He sends a letter to the players saying that he doesn't trust Vol'jin, but trusts the players' discretion in helping the Darkspear because every Orc and Troll that dies fighting each other is one less Alliance soldier lost in the fight.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Happens quite a bit in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Looking at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn">Tiberian Dawn</a></em> and onwards (the Covert Ops expansion missions take place after GDI's victory), it is implied that if Kane isn't there, the Brotherhood falls apart. Which certainly proves true in <em>Tiberian Sun</em>.
</li><li> The Nod campaign of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianSun">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun</a></em> starts you off fighting a Nod civil war. Only once you've beaten your rival does <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kane return</span> and then you launch your fight against GDI.
</li><li> Then you get to <em>Firestorm</em>, where Kane's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIIsACrapshoot">friendly neighborhood AI</a> CABAL goes loopy and decides to wipe all of mankind - both GDI <em>and</em> Nod.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberiumWars">Tiberium Wars</a></em> runs rampant with civil wars. Nod troops assault Temple Prime, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> apparently arranged to do so by a Nod <em>loyalist</em> trying to incriminate Kane's second in command for <em>questioning</em> his understandably obfuscating plans in <em>private</em></span>, then Kane turns around and orders the capture and execution of his own General Killian Qatar. In <em>Kane's Wrath</em>, the entire first act of the game is spent fighting Nod splinter factions.
</li><li> From Nod's perspective, GDI experiences one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianTwilight">Tiberian Twilight</a></em> when the player character's commanding officer tries to take down the elected government for perceived inaction against Kane.
</li><li> The actual <em>campaigns</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert">Red Alert 1</a></em> are free of this, but it does show up in some of the missions in the expansion packs (the Soviets have a few missions against Allied-supported rebels/traitors still utilizing Soviet weaponry, and one conflict against a rogue faction of the USSR).
</li><li> At some point in the Soviet campaign in both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Red Alert 2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3">Red Alert 3</a></em>, you'll have to fight a traitor general/mind-controlling maniac. Even the <em>Allies</em> suffer a small civil war: you have to put down the power-crazy US president.
</li><li> Subverted by the Empire of the Rising Sun in the base <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert3">Red Alert 3</a></em> game. The first half of the Empire campaign even sets up a growing conflict between Yoshiro and Tatsu until the two men manage to reconcile their differences (Yoshiro's <strike>Heroic</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">Villainous BSoD</a> after learning the nature of Soviet Time Travel helped too).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII">Star Control II</a></em>, the main villain at first appears to be the Ur-Quan Kzer-za, a fanatical race who want to enslave all other life in the galaxy. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> As it turns out, the Ur-Quan species is split between the aforementioned Kzer-za and the even <em>more</em> extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Kohr-ah</a>, who instead want to <em>kill</em> all other life in the galaxy. And the Kzer-za were protecting you from them. And the Kohr-Ah are winning, because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">the good guys took out about a third of the Kzer-Za combat fleet in a recent war.</a> Your first priority now becomes stopping the Kohr-ah</span>
<ul><li> You can also cause a Yehat civil war between the Starship and the Royal clans. Subverted in that the Starship clans are friendly to your cause and will help you in the end.
</li></ul></li><li> The first level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em> takes place during a battle between rebels and a mercenary army, who will attack anyone who does not belong to their faction. While the mercenaries work for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, they are only in the city because someone hired them, and the rebels really have no interest in Snake's mission at all.
<ul><li> You can use this to your advantage, too. If you start gunning down mercenaries or covering the rebels, they'll <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">see you as an ally instead.</a> This turns the first mission from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthBasedMission">Stealth-Based Mission</a> into a "enter the base completely unhindered and take all their items" mission.
</li></ul></li><li> Since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> puts the player on all sides of the conflict, just about any civil war that happens in-game counts as one:
<ul><li> The Terrans of the Korpulu Sector have had tons of civil wars. The planet of Korhal rose up against the Terran Confederacy until it was nuked to glass, and the Sons of Korhal carried on the fight. When the Confederacy fell and the Sons of Korhal formed the Terran Dominion to take its place, remnants of the Confederacy formed the Confederate Resistance Forces, led by Samir Duran.
</li><li> On the Zerg side of things, the player must at one point fight a rogue brood after its cerebrate has been murdered by the protagonist factions, while the expansion revolves around a massive civil war following the death of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Overmind</a>.
</li><li> For the Protoss, there's Tassadar's rebellion in the original, and then a brief relapse led by Aldaris during the expansion.
</li><li> The second game continues this tradition. While the Terran Dominion has taken the place of the former Confederacy, the Kel-Morians and the Umojans are both still in existence, plus Raynor's Raiders leading an insurrection against the Dominion from within. Kerrigan, having engineered her Brood Mothers to believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> full-stop, ends up having to fight one of her own who felt she had gone soft. Meanwhile, although the Khahai and Dark Templar factions of Protoss seem to have gotten along nicely (even to the point that their militaries have a unified chain of command and have co-engineered new technologies such as the Void Ray), a new splinter group has arisen in the Tal'Darim, who are loyal to Amon.
</li></ul></li><li> The Locust from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar">Gears of War</a></em> heads in this route, after the COG discover their enemies are waging the war on another front against their Lambent counterparts in <em>Gears of War 2</em>. The last game reveals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> this has been going on years <em>before</em> the first game; in fact, this trope was the whole reason behind the Human-Locust War, as the Locust couldn't find a quick enough solution to destroy the Lambent</span>.
</li><li> The Red Dragon Organization vs. The Black Dragon Organization from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga">Jedi Academy</a></em> has one mission with a situation like this, on the planet Yalara where Jaden is sent to destroy a cloaking device; he ends up in a three-way battle between him, the Imperial Remnant, and some alien assassins Darth Vader had left there years before.
</li><li> The dark side ending of <em>Academy</em> is also a three-way war between the Jedi, the Dark Jedi, and the evil player. Which itself was kind of a ripoff of the original <em>Jedi Knight</em>, in which the dark side ending is still a war between the player and the Dark Jedi, except the player's also a Dark Jedi.
</li><li> If you maxed out Mind Trick, which at its highest level converts a non-Jedi enemy to your side for 30 seconds, it's also possible to <em>create</em> an Enemy Civil War simply by performing Mind Trick on half a roomful of enemy mooks.
</li><li> And in <em>Outcast</em>, Fyyar intends to overthrow Desann. Of course, the guy was insane.
</li><li> To make sure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCampaignForTheWicked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCampaignForTheWicked">a campaign with the Empire</a> is acceptable, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter">TIE Fighter</a></em> spends more time with battles against Imperial splinters than with the Rebel Alliance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJediMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheJediMasters">The Jedi Masters</a></em> has an example with Kannos' takeover of Hulas' GenoHaradan. When plotting with the GenoHaradan leaders against Hulas, he made the heads extremely paranoid of each other, resulting in infighting. Hulas himself was finished off by Kannos when the other GenoHaradan leaders were all dead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em> has the Yakuza mook-army attacking the various factions that the Punisher has weakened. In one moment in the Kingpin's lobby, just wait in the elevator until the Yazuka has weakened the Kingpin's security forces.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Diablo">Diablo</a></em>, two lesser demon lords made a pact to overthrow the three greatest ones in one civil war, and afterward they started another civil war between them.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then it's revealed in <em>Diablo II</em> that the three greater demons masterminded the whole thing in order to get themselves exiled to the the human world.</span>
<ul><li> In <em>Diablo III</em>, this is cited as the main reason why Hell, despite all its overwhelming power and the bureaucratic mess of Heaven, kept on failing to win the Eternal War. Tyrael explains that once, Hell almost won, but then the demon lords started bickering and lost what was supposed to be a final push. So basically, the demon lords are their own worst enemies, second in threat only to the adventuring parties. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> So when Diablo's master plan is to sacrifice hordes of mooks and superpower the adventurers, just to merge all demon lords into his new body, it works and all Hell literally breaks loose in Heaven.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Done more simply in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> games. Get a monster to hit another of a different species (You can also invoke a fight with the same species if one of them hits an explosive barrel and it damages the other one), and bam, fight to the death. Then you shoot whichever one survived, weakened.
<ul><li> In earlier versions of the game, due to a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">bug</a>, a monster can even get into fight with itself<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0hcil');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0hcil" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0hcil');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">if it is damaged by a barrel that its own attack exploded; <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_slF2ne_drQ">this Cacodemon, for instance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">it generally will win</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a>: The Game</em>, it is possible to have gangsters from the different families fighting between each other, though it's more likely that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">they'll be attacking you</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a></em>, the monsters will sometimes attack each other. Unlike <em>Doom</em>, they don't have to hit each other, or even be particularly close. It's not just entertaining, it helps drive home the idea that the monsters are literal incarnations of hate and rage.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, the player learns that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Geth are split into two factions: the main "True" geth that have no real hostility towards organics and sent Legion to help you, and the splinter-faction "Heretics" who follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">The Reapers</a> and are the ones you fought in the first game</span>.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a> II</em> played this trope incredibly straight, in a way. In a war, if you captured the enemy's capital and they were sufficiently large enough or advanced enough, the civilization would split into two factions who would then immediately declare war on each other. While in a couple of turns they would establish peaceful relationships, this was a very powerful way to mess up stronger civs.
</li><li> This appears in several games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> series, at least from the perspective of other factions:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar">Medieval: Total War</a></em>, a faction who's royal family was destroyed, or who possessed a particularly weak monarch, could suffer rebellion as rival claimants attempted to seize the throne for themselves.
</li><li> In both <em>Medieval</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalIITotalWar">Medieval 2</a></em>, Catholic factions who have been excommunicated may suffer from widespread hostility from Papal loyalists, which can be seen as an Enemy Civil War from the perspective of any Muslim factions holding the Holy Land at that point. When the French are sending crusaders to Frankfurt, they're not sending them to Jerusalem....
</li><li> The <em>Barbarian Invasion</em> expansion to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar">Rome</a></em> also featured possible civil wars in the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, as well as the division of the Gothic faction into Ostrogoths and Visigoths.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EmpireTotalWar">Empire: Total War</a></em> includes emergent factions which can emerge into dissatisfied regions of an existing faction, e.g. Ireland, Scotland and the United States may rebel against British rule.
</li></ul></li><li> The Archers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII">Assassin's Creed II</a></em> will attack anyone on a roof who isn't another guard. This isn't limited to Ezio or thieves, but also pickpockets and Borgia Couriers, who are also enemies of Ezio. In Bonfire of the Vanities you will see Borgia agents and guards fighting Savonarola's loyalists even though both sides appear as red (i.e. hostile) in Eagle Vision.
<ul><li> Can be invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedRevelations">Assassin's Creed: Revelations</a></em>. Ottoman and Byzantine Templar guards will get into fights if they see each other, and one tutorial specifically tells you to make use of this.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedUnity">Assassin's Creed: Unity</a></em> features a heavy conflict between the 2 factions of Templars, divided between classic Templar Aristocrats and newer Mercantile templars. While the series is kicked off by the death of the aristocrat leader, the fight lasts the whole game, and ends <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> with both factions destroyed, though the merchant templars's goals were accomplished.</span>

Just as they're preparing to move in on the last remnants of resistance, however, the Korath Clan is discovered to be committing genocide on those they conquer. This makes the rest of the Drengin very angry (not because of moral scruples, but because killing everyone means there's no one left to be their slaves), and the Empire dissolves into civil war between the Korath and the rest of the Drengin.

All of the Demon Lords turned against each other and threw their mortal Infernomancers into the fray; while Dominic was loath to do it, he supported Karnak (who, his Infernomancer having been banished, was at a disadvantage) because it was a literal case of "the devil you know". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karnak ended the war by hurling a spear through the massed souls of the Chosen - when a soul is destroyed in the Deeganverse, it explodes, and this set off a chain reaction that killed all the other Demon Lords and tore Hell to shreds. He then pronounced himself King of Hell, as all other candidates were dead.</span>

Though Redcloak is largely incapable of betraying Xykon outright <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because he feels if he does, the death of his brother will be in vain</span> he doesn't particularly <em>like</em> him either, and will freely use him for his own ends and hide information from him.

There are also at least two demons (Skip and Chilus) who, while both being K'Z'K worshipers, have very differing takes on how K'Z'K's conquest of Earth should be brought about.

Sarv'swati is entrenched in Chel and has turned most of the other clans against her with her brutal policies and use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElCidPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElCidPloy">El Cid Ploy</a> to keep the peace, her sister Zala'ess declared herself Empress and buggered off to a neighboring city with a good chunk of the army to gain that city's ruling clans as her allies so she can take the city for herself from a weakened Sarv'swati, and Nishi'kanta and Sil'lice are the only two still loyal to their mother and have gone renegade and to yet another neighboring city to gather allies and attack their final and eldest sister, Snadhya'rune, who is entrenched in her own private estate at Felde and is ultimately responsible for the entire mess.
<ul><li> Also, the Sarghress lose their minds when Quain'tana decides to form an alliance with Zala'ess. This is probably the most rational decision she could make, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">as her complete conquest of Chel destroyed all food stores and trade relations with agricultural colonies</a> and Zala'ess had enough food to defend a siege against Snadhya'rune, but a serious majority of her troops think she finally betrayed them like any other post-revolutionary dictator.

Later, they start fighting each other, after which the Constructicons turn on Blitzwing, resulting in at least four factions fighting among themselves.
</li><li> Then, after Megatron finally exiled Starscream, ol' Screamer returned and successfully wrested control away from Megatron with the help of the Combaticons; he was only defeated when the Stunticons decided it would be worse if Starscream was in charge than Megatron.
</li><li> <em>Then</em> the Combaticons defected from Starscream and conquered Cybertron, forcing Starscream and Shockwave into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> situation as they both tried to regain control of the planet while not trusting each other in the slightest.
