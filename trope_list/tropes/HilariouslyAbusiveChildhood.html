</p><p>In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">real world</a>, abuse is a traumatic evil that can warp a child's psyche, causing them extensive physical and psychological problems as they develop into adults. Sometimes, abused children will go on to abuse children themselves. It's a horror that takes years of intensive therapy and anger management to recover from — and, worst case scenario, it can stay with you for life. Another possible unfortunate outcome is the abused child <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">putting an end to their own life</a>.
</p><p>In the media, on the other hand, a fair amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> can come from a character's horrible childhood. Notably, such comedy seldom includes sexual abuse (unless you're a writer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>), which tends to take things into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a> territory if it's molestation or rape. (If it's something like forcing a child to wear clothes that don't match their gender identity or attempting to convince them that they're biologically the other sex, then it's a gray area, because it <em>is</em> considered sexual abuse, but it's not in the way viewers think it is. Sexual humiliation that's not consensual does count as abuse.) It's usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">Parental Neglect</a>, physical abuse (though, due to changing values, that's falling a bit out of favor), exaggerated takes on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalFavoritism">Parental Favoritism</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">Sibling Rivalry</a>, witnessing events and things that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors">Harmful to Minors</a>, or abuse so over the top that it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossesTheLineTwice">exaggerated to the point of comedy</a>.

To list some of the things that has happened to her: Her mother was possessed by the devil, and in order to cure her, she was forced to repeatedly strike her with a cross, her father became redundant, and repeatedly tried to kill himself, even if he was described as a caring and loving father, the teacher who she's in love with is also trying to kill himself all the time.

</li><li> Nozomu as well, albeit in a different way. The audience doesn't see his upbringing, but given (as part of family tradition), his family tries to force him to marry the first person he locks eyes with during a ceremony, it's unlikely to have been that normal.

<div class="indent"><strong>Luffy</strong>: Yeah! So don't attack him!!! He'll <em>kill</em> you...!!! Grandpa's nearly killed <em>me</em>, often enough! <br/><strong>Garp</strong>: Hey!

Ace likely had a similar (if not <em>worse</em>) childhood — which was confirmed during the flashback to Luffy and Ace's past together after Marineford. Note that Ace is every bit as scared of Garp as Luffy is; he only went against him when defending his younger brother.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ditto for Sabo. He spent only a fraction of the amount of time Luffy and Ace did with Garp, but by the end of his first meeting with the old man, he was every bit as terrified of him as they were</span>.

</li><li> Allen Walker's childhood from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>. His abuse and psychological trauma at the hands of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor">master</a> General Cross is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedicSociopathy">played entirely for laughs</a>. Whenever he hears the word "debt," it's shown as a thousand-pound rock is crushing his chest, and he gets <em>very</em> depressed. This was caused by Cross being an alcoholic gambler that left young Allen with all his debt... along with hitting Allen, all done in a funny (or sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeNotFunny">Dude, Not Funny!</a>) light, of course.

But then they <em>asked</em> her to train them. They even <em>insisted</em>, because they were desperate for power, and Izumi actually <em>went easy on them</em> and what they were put through was child's play compared to the training Izumi went through herself. Of course, her idea of going easy on them during their training was to strand them on a deserted island for a month, then get her store assistant to dress up as a monster, steal their food, and beat the crap out of them every day until they toughened up. At least he was around to make sure they didn't die, which was more than she got (she was supposed to train under a skilled alchemist, but instead under his martial arts twin brother.

</li><li> Classic British comics like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDandy">The Dandy</a></em> began in the very early part of the 20th Century, and, in the case of The Beano, is still here today in 2020. Much of the humour in the serial strips arose from the inevitable parental retribution meted out to misbehaving child characters, often involving the flat of the hand applied with percussive force to sensitive parts of the body. Belts, straps, slippers and canes also figured as corrective devices. This persisted in the pages of these comics even after corporal punishment fell out of favour in the latter part of the 20th century - the anachronistic nature of a punishment that fewer and fewer children had seen or experienced added to the laughs. The death knell for this approach to comic humour came about when in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, Scotland made it illegal to slap or cane a child, redefining corporal punishment and physical chastisement as child abuse.

<div class="indent"><strong>Bill</strong>: Another time I was cut from the high school football team and my mother said, "Central's lost a fullback but the McNeals have gained a daughter" - and in front of the other players too... priceless! Good times... good times... <br/><strong>Lisa</strong>: And this is a happy memory for you? <br/><strong>Bill</strong>: Why shouldn't it be?
</div></li><li>
<div class="indent"><strong>Bill</strong>: I remember one time my father came home from a night on the town which of course had turned into a week and my mother said, "John, is there anything you won't drink?" and my father shot back, "Poison... I'm saving it for you." (Laughing) And I and my brother, who is now an alcoholic himself, just about died laughing...
</div></li><li> Another episode reveals that Bill loves eating stale sandwiches out of an antiquated vending machine in the office that no one else uses. The reason? They remind him of the sandwiches his mother would make for him; she'd leave a week's supply in a tin box outside the house.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MalcolmInTheMiddle">Malcolm in the Middle</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show borders on this for the younger boys, who simply gripe about their mom lightly, but with Francis it's almost always averted and he has deep-seated hatred for her, acknowledging that psychological abuse is serious and long-term. Possibly because for them, this is the norm, while Francis has already flown the nest and seen just how horrible the things Lois did really are, and how much it has messed him up (though there are also indications that Francis was disturbed in the first place, so it's not entirely certain how much of it was Lois's fault). The closest any of the younger boys has gotten to realizing how unhealthy Lois treats them is Malcolm, the genius.
</li><li> In one episode, Dewey begins to stop taking part in his brothers' antics and begins acting more responsible and mature, being pleasant to his mother and no longer causing trouble, which causes Lois to stop harassing him. Malcolm and Reese corner him to find out why she isn't harassing him any more like she does them, but when he tries to explain - that the only reason she acts that way towards them is because they keep misbehaving - they either don't understand, or refuse to accept it, and vow to find out how he does it.
</li><li> In the episode "Reese's Apartment", this trope is possibly lampshaded when Lois and Hal kick Reese out of the house, and he finds a way to get his own apartment. Francis attempts to convince the family that kicking out a teenager is abuse, but none of them believe him.
</li><li> Lois herself had a genuinely abusive childhood, which may have affected how she treats her kids; her mother is a cruel, racist, domineering, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> lunatic from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">"old country."</a> Even Francis, who loves nothing more than tormenting his mother, fully acknowledges that his grandmother is completely insane, especially when Francis finds out that she has been buying Christmas presents for the family each year - exactly what they wanted - but refusing to send them because of inconsequential slights. Her episodes usually result in a truce within the family who will band together to get rid of her.
</li><li> Hal can also be like this. He tends to ignore the well-being of the family for his own happiness and comfort, such as not working Fridays for years while his wife sacrificed a lot. He also forbids Malcolm from going to an exclusive, all expenses paid prep school because Hal relies on Malcolm to solve his problems (even though Malcolm said that him not being a major factor of the finances would benefit the family). Hal <em>also</em> had a bad childhood of his own, albeit of a totally different sort. His father is an eccentric millionaire, but was too wrapped up in his own fantasies and games to do any actual parenting. Not that he didn't <em>care</em> about Hal, of course; but he barely noticed how miserable he was.
</li><li> This also ties in to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesFinale">Series Finale</a>, where Lois refuses Malcolm a high-paying job out of high school since their plan for him is to work his way up from the bottom of society to become President of the United States, and in fact had been planning <em>his whole life</em>.

It's summed up nicely in this line from his book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmAmericaAndSoCanYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmAmericaAndSoCanYou">I Am America (And So Can You!)</a></em>:

<ul><li> Barney Stinson often alludes to his "hilarious" childhood, involving being left alone by his mother for weeks at a time and being told that his father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Bob Barker, former host of ''The Price Is Right''</a>. They did, however, get a moment of legitimate pathos out of it in the episode where the Bob Barker thing was revealed. Barney goes on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePriceIsRight">The Price Is Right</a></em> with the intent of telling Bob Barker that he's his son, but can't bring himself to do it. The implication is that deep down he knows Barker isn't his father but won't admit it to himself, and a later episode revealed that many of his mother's lies were due to her actually being overprotective of Barney. She did not want him to feel humiliated or unloved so she would make up outrageous stories that seemed believable to a young child. However, this seems to have caused Barney to have a massive ego and an inability to deal with disappointment as an adult. And the icing on the cake is that his mother was apparently the female version of what he is today. Or <em>worse</em>.
</li><li> She also sent his real father away and never told Barney he was his father.
</li><li> Then there's Lily, who at first glance seems like a sweet, motherly type. But, as Marshall says, she has some serious Crazy Eyes. Then, we get the flashbacks to Lily's deadbeat dad, taking her to the racetrack with him so he could gamble. On her birthday. Which he had forgotten. And, later telling a sick young Lily the many ways she could die from tonsil surgery.
</li><li> And last, but definitely not least, Robin, who grew up with a dad who remained in denial of the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantedASonInstead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantedASonInstead">she wasn't a boy</a> until <em>she was fourteen</em>. And, when he found her kissing a boy, sent her packing to military camp where she was forced to burn her clothes. She has some daddy issues.

Xander Harris had some sort of abuse happening in his home (especially in the episode "Restless"). This trope is played with in the episode "Amends", where Xander appears to make a joke about his "holiday tradition" of sleeping outside to avoid his family's drunken holiday fights-but when he is actually shown sleeping outside and being woken up by the (very rare) Christmas snowfall, it's actually quite poignant. Even more so when you consider that he would rather risk being eaten by vampires than sleep indoors with his family.

<ul><li> Leonard recounts the cold and emotionless way his mother treated him, which led him to become a shy, self-hating neurotic. As a child, he was so starved for affection that he actually built a simple hugging machine... and his father used to borrow it.
</li><li> Sheldon is revealed to have been so traumatized by his parents' constant fighting when he was a child that he is unable to be around people arguing. He goes so far as to run away from his apartment when roommate Leonard won't stop arguing with his girlfriend. His mother turned to religion to escape and his father to alcohol, giving Sheldon an aversion to both of those too. As well, despite being a global-level child prodigy, neither parent supported his interest in science. His father especially tried to get him in sports despite a complete lack of interest and physicality.
</li><li> Of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">much of this is now conflicted by the YoungSheldon spin-off</a>, which shows a much milder level of sitcom dysfunction with plenty of heartwarming moments where the family does their best to support the quirky young genius and his interests even if they don't really <em>get</em> him.

<div class="indent"><strong>Nathan</strong>: He's suppose to take me out for the day, so he takes me to IKEA. He buys so much flat-pack furniture there's no room for me in the car, so he leaves me there for three hours. Then some guy with a beard sees me hanging around and buys me lunch. I spent my eighth birthday eating Swedish meatballs with a known pedophile. <br/><strong>Jamie</strong>: Did he... <br/><strong>Nathan</strong>: No, no. Dad got back when we were finishing our ice cream, but that sick pervert cared more about me than Dad ever did. He would've taken me to the zoo.

He's raised in a family where he is loved genuinely, but the many bad things befalling him are so over-the-top (the fact that said events all occur BY ACCIDENT adds to the humor factor) make his childhood life appear like this (for instance, in one episode, he's shown in flashback to have accidentally bumped his head on some hard surface 5 times).

When Raylan's mother Frances died, Arlo got a good deal on some tombstones so he had some premade for himself and Raylan. He then had Frances buried in a plot in front of their house and had the extra tombstones placed there as well. So whenever Raylan would leave the house he would see his mother's grave and his own grave ready next to her. However, a few episodes later we are shown what Arlo is really like and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> stops being funny.

Brad's parents didn't like him because they wanted a daughter (and dressed him as a girl for the first few years of his life), yet at the same time they disapproved of his dream of becoming a ballet dancer and forced him to go into science. At some point you just have to wonder if they weren't screwing with him on purpose. He once insults someone by saying terrible things about their childhood, culminating with "Kids at school once had a contest of whom could throw the biggest rock at you, and your teacher won," only to stop and say "No wait, that's my childhood."

His mother made him live in a box under the stairs in the basement, and force-fed him nothing but sauerkraut until he was 26. (And a half.) He didn't get out of there until he won a plane ticket to the eponymous city in a radio contest.

Their heavily religious doctor tried to separate them in cold-blood with a chainsaw, but a sheriff saw him before he could do anything and shot him. Their father was killed when the chainsaw flew out of the doctor's arms and hit him in the neck. When the sheriff was driving the girls someplace, a truck full of chickens struck him. The owner of the truck stole the twins, while he leaves the sheriff and his chickens to die. Evelyn Evelyn (who weren't even named at the time) were kept in a cage and fed chicken-food for the first six years of their lives. The man ended up dying and the girls escaped after several days of living around dying, dehydrated chickens. They end up kidnapped by a man and are forced into a child sex ring. Evelyn Evelyn were finally named, "Eva" and "Lynn", though no one could remember which was which so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">they were renamed "Evelyn Evelyn"</a>. Once Evelyn Evelyn hit thirteen they're sent off to work at freak show, where they were regularly overworked and abused. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friends</a>, a set of conjoined elephants named Bimba and Kimba, end up developing early-onset Alzheimer's and die of malnutrition. Two radical religious protest groups, one that believes all Siamese twins should be separated while the other thinks twins should stay conjoined because they'll play a role in the second coming of Christ, end up developing an interest in them and threaten to harm and kidnap them respectively. Fearing their safety, they run away at age seventeen. Their adult lives are not exactly perfect but they're far better than their childhood was.

<ul><li> The Demoman was given up for adoption at birth, accidentally killed his adoptive parents, sent to an orphanage, and only contacted by his real parents when his bitterness and lack of depth perception had honed his demolition skills. If similar things aren't confirmed for at least half of the cast, I'll eat my shirt.
</li><li> Apparently averted at first with the Sniper, who still speaks with his parents. The only hiccup seems to be his father's disapproval with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">line of work</a>. Later on, he discovers that his family has been killed by assailants unknown...and they turn out to not be his real family. The truth is that he was accidentally launched out of the sunken island of New Zealand as a child by his idiotic pseudoexpert father, who flooded all of New Zealand in the process. Whether that specifically is abuse is up for debate, but judging by what we see of him, Sniper's dad isn't exactly playing with a full deck, and his mother is shrewish and prone to drinking—he probably was better off being launched out of the ocean and onto Australia.
</li><li> The Heavy's father was a counter-revolutionary who was executed and left the young Heavy, his mother, and his sisters all to be sent to a Siberian Gulag. Four months later The Heavy had broken his family out, destroyed the facility, and tortured every single guard and soldier inside to death.

Eamon's idea of raising this child involved making him sleep in the stables with the hounds, where he accidentally locked himself in a cage at least once and nobody found him for hours. When Alistair was ten, Eamon got married, and his new wife was convinced that Alistair was Eamon's own bastard. Rather than treat him with any kindness, she talked her husband into sending the boy away; he was handed off to the church to be raised and forced into life as a Templar. He's about twenty years old by the time of the game, and only escaped his old life because he was recruited to the Grey Wardens, a military outfit which guarantees a relatively early death, but which at least enabled him to make friends and feel like he was part of a family for the first time in his life.

<ul><li> Malory left Archer in the care of heroin addict Woodhouse for the first few years of his life, and then continued to neglect him, leaving him alone when he was in pain and at one point moving without telling Archer's boarding school, leading to him to take a train home alone and eventually ending up at a police station. She also kickstarted his alcoholism, giving him alcholol when he was child, and denied him (much needed) psychological care. Moreover, she verbally and psychologically abused him.

</li><li> Lampshaded in the fake making-of episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E22BehindTheLaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS11E22BehindTheLaughter">Behind the Laughter</a>", where the "real" Homer tells how he strangled the "real" Bart for the first time and everyone in the room thought it was funny. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouBastard">"And that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags."</a> Possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a>, who came up with the eye-poke gag when one of them did it to a cheater in a card game.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattGroening">Matt Groening</a> has stated that the inspiration for Homer's over-the-top abuse is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheKatzenjammerKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheKatzenjammerKids">The Katzenjammer Kids</a></em>, and that he originally insisted that the strangling always be impulsive on Homer's part, and that Bart always retaliate in some way. These policies quickly fell by the wayside, however, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> took their place.
</li><li> Subverted in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS23E9HolidaysOfFuturePassed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS23E9HolidaysOfFuturePassed">Holidays of Future Passed</a>" in a conversation between Lisa and Marge, where it's revealed "Homer's Law" makes it illegal to strangle any child for any reason. What does it say about the Simpsons' world that that implies that it previously <em>wasn't</em>?
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E20ChildrenOfALesserClod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS12E20ChildrenOfALesserClod">Children of a Lesser Clod</a>", Homer starts a daycare business and treats the kids far better than his own. When he's given an award, Bart and Lisa take revenge by showing a video montage of his usual parenting, including the scene on the image at the top of this page (which Homer claims was "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">completely taken out of context</a>").
</li><li> In one episode, Rod and Todd are shown shivering with some disease because Ned doesn't believe in innoculations.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>:
<ul><li> Butters's parents ground, beat and berate him constantly; his mother went crazy and attempted to drown him in a lake; his parents attempt to sell him to Paris Hilton; Cartman convinces him the world is ending and he lives in a bunker and a junkyard for several weeks; he gets committed to a mental asylum and anally probed by a machine for eight straight hours... the creators ended up having to put a moratorium on torturing Butters because it was just becoming too much.
<div class="indent"> "Butters... <em>why there is Hamburger Helper in my glass of milk</em>?"
</div><ul><li> Ironically, "Jared has Aides," an episode whose entire plot is about what is and isn't too offensive to joke about, is rarely shown in reruns because people found the ending (where Butters is physically beaten offscreen) to be horrifying. Yeah. They found it.
</li><li> Butters has also been sexually abused by his Uncle Bud. When an investigator shows the things that pedophiles do to children, he licks the doll's crotch and Butters tells him that his Uncle Bud does that to him.
</li></ul></li><li> The abuse of other children is implied as well.
<ul><li> Cartman, for example, wakes from a dream shouting "No, Uncle Jesse, no!" (though that could have been a reference to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>). However, Father Maxi is the only priest shown in the <em>South Park</em> universe who <em>doesn't</em> molest children, preferring carnal relations with temptresses his own age. Cartman has been sexually abused by others, specifically noted in the episode "Simpsons Already Did It".
</li><li> Cartman's mother abuses him in a different way. Her constant pampering and coddling of him turned him into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">The Sociopath</a> that he is today. This comes from her own fear of being alone. It's made obvious in "Tsst!" - when she treats him like other parents treat their children, his behavior quickly changes (and changes back when she relents).
</li><li> Shelley's abuse of Stan is also played for laughs, as is the fact that his parents refuse to believe him, regardless of how many bruises he has or how much he asks for help. Only once did they attempt to defend him ("Over-Logging"), but Shelley went right back to abusing Stan halfway through the episode without Randy, Sharon, or their grandfather caring.
</li><li> Kyle is also subjected to emotional abuse at the hands of his controlling mother.
</li></ul></li><li> "Noo... don't kick da baby..." "Kick the baby!" "<em>Don't kick da goddamn baby</em>" "<strong>Kick the baby!</strong>"
</li><li> Tweek's parents encourage him to drink copious amounts of coffee, ignoring the resulting insomnia and nervousness. They even send him to collect coffee deliveries from the local meth lab.
</li><li> Ironically, one of the few major characters who never suffers on-screen child abuse (except maybe neglect) at home is Kenny McCormick, whose parents are <em>alcoholic rednecks</em>. Not that his home life is exactly what you'd call "healthy" either (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandardAbuseFemaleOnMale">his mother beats his father,</a> for one thing).
<ul><li> It's never shown onscreen, sure, but in the episode "The Poor Kid" where Kenny and his siblings are taken away by Child Protective Services, their (admittedly incompetent) social worker does list various types of abuse in their case files.
</li></ul></li><li> Mr. Garrison feels that he had a traumatic childhood because his father <em>didn't</em> sexually abuse him, and to Garrison, this means that his father didn't love him. Mr. Mackey, the guidance counselor, says that the only way to save his son's life is for the elder Garrison to have sex with him, and he finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">hires Kenny G to pretend to be him and sleep with the younger Garrison.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> While he <em>is</em> actually surrounded by loving and supportive parental figures, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> occasionally likes to play Steven's Gem-inflicted trauma for laughs, such as in "Last One Out of Beach City" when he cheerfully tells Pearl that fleeing from the police in a high-speed car chase was "The most fun I've had since that time you almost let me die!" Or, in a completely separate incident near the end of "Space Race":
<div class="indent"><strong>Pearl</strong>: I'm so sorry. I almost got us killed.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Steven</strong> <em>[unfazed]</em>: I'm used to it!
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em>: Splinter isn't really abusive per se, but he is training his sons to be warriors while raising them and many of his lessons can be rather painful.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo">Teen Titans Go!</a></em> version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> is strongly implied to have hit Robin for small misdeeds. After leaving Batman to be his own hero, Robin still cowers in fear when he thinks Batman is around and is terrified of making him angry.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimeSquad">Time Squad</a></em>: Otto's upbringing is outrageously horrible to the point of it being morbidly funny. He was raised in an orphanage where he was worked relentlessly by the sadistic nun Sister Thornly, bullied mercilessly by the other kids and forbidden from doing the only thing he enjoyed: reading about history. Were it not for the freak encounter with the Time Squad, who knows how miserable his life could have ended up as.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rusty Venture's boyhood manages to teeter on the edge of being serious and morbidly funny. He was constantly being kidnapped and his father used him as little more than a prop to make himself look good, plus the issues this left him with are what made him the morally bankrupt mad scientist he is today. But given the laughs we get from the show already, seeing Jonas Venture drunkenly fall on top of Rusty while trying to score with this woman he just met is darkly hilarious. Likely this had something to do with his relationship with twin brother Jonas Jr., who did not go through any of this (having been swallowed as a fetus by Rusty and made his way out as an adult) and is every bit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">Smug Super</a> that Jonas Sr. was.
</li><li> Rusty's traumatic childhood is just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">Freudian Excuse</a> he has for treating his own sons so poorly and placing them in many of the same life-threatening situations he himself experienced. Apart from the constant danger and kidnappings they experience, the boys also have a very impoverished home life and no friends thanks mostly to being homeschooled in a box their pop made (and it sometimes gets very hot in the box that pop made). The most telling piece of evidence comes from the episode "Powerless in the Face of Death" when Rusty and Brock jovially recount all of the ways the boys have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">died</span>. The hilarity of child abuse gets a wonderful 'metaphoric' representation midway through this montage, when we see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dr. Venture as a werewolf kill his own kids</span> and we all laugh.
