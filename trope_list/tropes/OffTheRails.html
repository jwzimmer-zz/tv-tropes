It's about halfway through the campaign, and the players have decided that everything is only going to get worse.

The players go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Off the Rails</a>.
</p><p>This can take many forms, and isn't always malicious or even intentional: more benign variants come from a dissonance between the DM's expectations and the players', in which the latter derails the former's campaign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">simply because they didn't know any better</a>.

Or pauses the game to confer with his players about them ruining the adventure. A more creative Game Master, on the other hand, will take this player revolt and run with it, spinning a new plot out of the threads of the players' actions. Of course, good <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Masters</a> rarely have their players revolt on them in the first place. On rare occasions, truly great <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Masters</a> will be able to roll with the punches and change the story itself to work with the players' actions, creating something entertaining for everyone involved. A party going thoroughly and maliciously Off the Rails is often a herald of the end of the gaming group, or at least the end of one person's tenure as Game Master. Alternately, if there's just one player who's dissatisfied and he keeps grabbing the throttle and gunning the train, that player's character may be subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoltOfDivineRetribution">a lightning bolt on a cloudless day</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">sudden violent chest pains</a>, or a <a class="urllink" href="https://cad-comic.com/comic/dm-rules/">drive-by mauling by a mind flayer that leaves everyone else untouched<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

When she gets her memories back, she quickly realizes she's not just any noble, she's actually a character from an otome game and the <em>villain</em> at that. If she does what the game character does she'll probably end up murdered or exiled, so she sets out to avoid her 'destruction ends' by making sure to train in magic and swordsmanship so she'll be harder to take out, learns to plow a field in case she fails and gets exiled and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">practices throwing toy snakes at her fiancee.</a> However, while these are all ideas doomed to failure, she <em>does</em> still derail the game script almost immediately because unlike the game character, the new Katarina is super nice and accidentally seduces all the love interests that were supposed to fall for the game's heroine, who <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenTheGirlsWantHer">also</a></em> falls in love with Katarina.

It starts with Albedo declaring she attacks the quest-giver for being a human and goes downhill from there (resulting in one of the funniest moments in the entire series).
<ul><li> The heroes are attacked by bandits. Ever practical, Demiurge starts stripping them for parts, including <em>flaying the corpses</em>.
</li><li> When the heroes run into a bunch of fairies (whose treasure was stolen by the bandits), the heroes negotiate their way out of a fight by showing the fairies... <em>the bandits' skins</em>.
</li><li> A treasure chest contains various potions with magical effects. On learning that it takes a turn to drink one, Albedo asks if she can just keep hers in her mouth to save time. Mare finds a potion that switches his gender (Mare already being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate">Elfeminate</a> crossdresser), Aura finds one that ages her a few years (being an elf, there's little change there either), Demiurg roleplays his potion's requirement that he say "Ribbit" to get a damage bonus by adding it to every single sentence, and Shalltear's will cause her to explode the next time she takes fire damage. The final one is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a can of Coke</span>.
</li><li> Having finally gotten the team to work together, Ainz is almost ready to wrap it up and have the village chief reward the heroes... and then Demiurge starts picking apart the scenario, coming to the conclusion that the village chief was in cahoots with the goblins all along, having developed a lucrative business sending murderhoboes to their deaths in the goblins' cave and splitting the loot with them. Ainz says "screw it", makes the village chief a demon in disguise, and the campaign ends in a blaze of glory... with his underlings <em>still</em> thinking humans are worthless creatures.

And sometimes, the characters purposefully derail the story just to be entertained. A good example is the very first chapter of <em>Sleeping Blooper</em>, where during the scene where Maleficent (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">Queen Chrysalis</a>) first appears, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a> shoots her right as she was about to curse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kairi</a> (playing the role of Princess Aurora). The rest of the fanfic is trying to make an entertaining story despite the fact that the main driving force of the story is destroyed.

Going Off The Rails is also a typical response by Loopers who Loop into an unpleasant situation outside of their baseline (such as when Twilight Sparkle Looped into a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">Nineteen Eighty Four</a></em> setting) and immediately decide to do something about it.
<ul><li> It's also noted that some characters (mostly certain Loopers, non-Loopers and Loop-Aware Entities obsessed with preserving the timeline) tend to react poorly when Loopers do this.

As such, characters (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>) would occasionally go Off the Rails by doing things that seemed logical to them but didn't make sense within the simulation.
<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a></em> episode "Night", Tom Paris has Seven of Nine play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> in his Captain Proton simulation who gets captured by Satan's Robot. Instead of following the plot, Seven takes the most logical route, opens a convenient hatch on the robot, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreTheseWiresImportant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreTheseWiresImportant">pulls out its wiring</a>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Robot:</strong> Citizen of Earth, surrender! Do not resist! <br/><strong>Seven:</strong> I am Borg. <em>(Rips out wiring)</em> <br/><strong>Robot:</strong> <em>(Deactivating)</em> Surrrennndurrr...

(Q had stated that he had given the fantasy "a life all its own so I have no more idea what's going to happen than you do.")

Data at once solves the entire case (which is supposed to be the length of a full novel or a film) by firing a short barrage of questions at the man and ripping open his jacket to reveal evidence that he is a counter-agent. He was remembering how the original novel went. Unfortunately, he had read all the original novels. Geordi storms off. The next time goes no better because the computer simply attempts to pastiche elements from the novels, and (let's repeat) Data had read them all. The <em>next</em> time they try a holo-novel, Geordi accidentally asks the computer to create "an adversary capable of defeating <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">Data</a></strong>" (not Holmes).

In their live performance at Drury Lane, when John asks if the slug replacement talks, Palin answers with a prompt "Yes."

<ul><li> Another time Palin disrupted the sketch was when he answered (to the same question) "Well, he mutters a little" which caused Cleese to break down with laughter and, once he could continue, ask the audience where they had gotten up to so they could carry on.
</li><li> Yet another variation: near the beginning of the sketch when John Clesse says that the parrot is dead, Palin examines it and says, "So it is", then gives Cleese a refund and apologizes for the inconvenience.

The final challenge involved creating a signal that could reach a certain height. Tory and Grant set up the surroundings to provide all of the materials needed to build a potato cannon, which results in quite a surprise when Adam and Jamie build a kite instead, using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">rope that they were tied up with at the very beginning of the segment</a>. As the solution was both effective and in the spirit of the challenge, it was deemed successful.
<ul><li> In another episode, Adam and Jamie made a challenge for each other: to build home-made hovercraft using household materials and under a budget and have a race with the machines they build. Both at first conform to the rules. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Then Adam begins cheating</a>.

Since formal identification turned out to be too expensive one player decided to learn more about the orb by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">dropping it on the ground to see if it smashes</a>. It did. Having failed the quest the players decided that they might as well ignore the quest giver and wander off with the powerful weapon. The GM sends an assassin after the party who seemed to be powerful enough to have killed them all in a fair fight, but they somehow manage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrapplingWithGrapplingRules">trip her and then pin her underneath an unconscious party member whilst impaling her through the arm</a>. The following week the GM gave up on heavily planned quests and kept preparations brief since it was clear that his players were too unpredictable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading">railroad</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheAdventureZoneBalance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Podcast/TheAdventureZoneBalance">The Adventure Zone: Balance</a></em> , a series of event known as Arms Outstretched forced DM Griffin to abort an entire planned arc in the Astral Plane (afterlife) and rewrite a significant amount of the finale.

<ul><li> The scripted nature of a live performance like professional wrestling can lead to this happening often. While it's rare for a performer to completely Go Into Business For Himself (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> term for it), because they'll be most likely fired and blackballed; injuries, ring and prop malfunctions, etc., can force wrestlers to improvise a lot, leading to a completely different "story" from what was planned to unfold. This can happen in promos too, with the wrestler forgetting what their points were and going off on tangents; these can be made worse if they are talking to someone else and they just go with it.
</li><li> During the 2005 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RoyalRumble">Royal Rumble</a> match, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a> was supposed to dump <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> over the top rope. But Batista accidentally sent himself over the ropes with Cena, causing them both to hit the floor at the exact same time. Cena, Batista and the referees improvised an argument about who won until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/VinceMcMahon">Vince McMahon</a> came down to the ring to restart things with just the two of them. Incidentally, McMahon would also tear both of his quadriceps getting into the ring, resulting in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a> for him.
</li><li> The "Phantom Submission Match", of November 22nd 1985. Between 1984 and 1985, David Sammartino, son of famed wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BrunoSammartino">Bruno Sammartino</a>, wrestled for the WWF. His entire run was a transparent ploy to lure Bruno back on TV. If Bruno was in his son's corner, David was pushed to the moon; if he wasn't, David was buried. Eventually David got tired of this treatment and decided to quit as decisively as possible. On the match in question, he quickly tapped out to a bearhug from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobber">Jobber</a> Ron Shaw, forcing the referee to declare Ron the winner or break Kayfabe by refusing to accept David's unscripted submission. Naturally he was fired shortly after.
</li><li> Another example is the infamous 1998 "Brawl For All" boxing tournament. Although the whole point of the tournament was that it was a "shoot", with non-scripted finishes, the winner of the tournament Bart Gunn claims that the WWF had all but anointed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrDeathSteveWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DrDeathSteveWilliams">"Dr. Death" Steve Williams</a> as the champion behind the scenes, including paying him the prize money after the first round. Gunn alleges that he was asked to job to Williams and refused. He legitimately knocked Williams out and won the tournament, and claims his 35 second loss by knockout at Wrestlemania to Butterbean (an actual boxer) and subsequent firing was a punishment for screwing up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorkedShoot">the plan</a>.
</li><li> The infamous debut of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FredOttman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/FredOttman">The Shockmaster</a> in WCW went off the rails from his planned character. A prop malfunction combined with a difficult to see out of mask led the wrestler to trip over the set during his debut on live TV. The character was hastily rewritten from being a complete bad ass to being a somewhat clumsy comedy character.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a>'s rap improvisation during a Halloween skit (while he was dressed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanillaIce">Vanilla Ice</a>) led them re-writing his character from generic tough young dude to a white rapper, which evolved to his current megastar persona. Not bad for a guy who was probably a few weeks from being cut by the WWE.
</li><li> If a wrestler suffers a serious injury that means he cannot safely continue (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BretHart">Bret Hart</a> breaking his ribs in a match with Dino Bravo), becomes concussed and therefore can no longer take instructions or pull his punches, or is otherwise impaired, his opponent needs to end the match immediately for both their sakes, regardless of the planned finish. Popular methods include pinning him for real, getting themselves disqualified, or getting one of them counted out (this is the favoured method in title matches, since titles can only change hands on a pin or submission).
<ul><li> For a prime example, there's the <em>Summerslam 1989</em> match between The Red Rooster, aka Terry Taylor, and Mr. Perfect, aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtHennig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CurtHennig">Curt Hennig</a>. Taylor <em>very</em> obviously blows out his knee during an exchange, and moments later Hennig is forced to hit the Perfectplex out of nowhere for the finish. Taylor was out for a couple months afterward.
</li><li> The infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ImpactWrestling">TNA</a> match between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sting">Sting</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JeffHardy">Jeff Hardy</a> is a particularly notorious example, as a clearly intoxicated Jeff was obviously in no condition to perform, and Sting had to end the match within a minute and a half.
</li></ul></li><li> Cryme Tyme were set to face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CadeAndMurdoch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CadeAndMurdoch">Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch</a> in a match that was scripted to end in a double count-out. Behind the scenes, Cade and Murdoch changed it and got the referee in on the plan. So they rushed to the ring and the referee counted fast. Shad was legitimately pissed off and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">hit the referee with his finisher</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a> was defending her Women's Championship against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a>. She was set to retain, but tore her ACL moments into the match. The women visibly had to improvise a quick finish where Trish beat her and regained the title.
</li><li> In 1982, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a> wrestled Dominican wrestler Jack Veneno for the NWA Heavyweight Championship in Veneno's home country. Flair was booked to retain, but, when he realised how hardcore and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">passionate</a> the Dominican fans were, he was genuinely afraid they would riot if he beat the hometown hero. He called a new ending on the fly where Veneno had him in a sleeper hold just as the time ran out. Flair then ran to the airport and as soon as he was safely back in the States, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NationalWrestlingAlliance">NWA</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">"stripped"</a> Veneno of the title and pretended the match never happened.
</li><li> At WCW Souled Out 2000, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanMalenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DeanMalenko">Dean Malenko</a> faced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BillyKidman">Billy Kidman</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatchWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatchWrestling">Catch Wrestling</a> match. The match was contested under a rigidly enforced old-school set of rules, i.e. no coming off the ropes, no strikes, no leaving the ring, etc., just shoot-style mat-based technical wrestling. Malenko, who was booked to win, straight up forgot the stipulation, slid out of the ring two minutes into the match, and was immediately disqualified.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EveTorres">Eve Torres</a> was scripted to win a #1 contenders battle royal in 2012. Except while doing a spot with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kaitlyn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kaitlyn">Kaitlyn</a>, she accidentally fell off the apron. The reigning Divas' Champion <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Layla">Layla</a> was visibly shocked watching at ringside. This worked out for Kaitlyn in the long run - where the resulting storyline had Eve arranging to have her attacked before her title match, and Kaitlyn and Layla trying to prove it. Kaitlyn ended up becoming the top face of the division for a while.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella Twins</a> debuted with a gimmick where one twin would wrestle, and the other would hide under the ring to switch at some point during the match. After one match, Brie didn't get out from under the ring in time and had to stay under for the rest of the taping. Including a match between the Big Show and the Great Khali!

In practice, this amounted to Edgardo having to wait days just to be able to do a single attack that did little more than knock the wind out of an enemy. Then the narrator learns about the city of Haven, home of the Spirit Well. While inside the city, the effects of the Spirit Well cause characters to constantly regenerate all of their Spirit instantly. Since Edgardo had Overflowing Spirit, this gave him <em>infinite</em> Spirit. Cue Edgardo punching straight through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s impenetrable force field and right into his smug face with an unblockable infinite-damage attack.

A DM had his players, on a spiritual quest, encounter what he thought would be a simple virtue challenge: a powerful magic rapier and magic chain shirt on a pedestal, guarded by a little girl (actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">spiritual construct</a>). The little girl could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToCorneria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToCorneria">only say two things</a>: "No" or — if a "No" answer would be misleading — "Please do not take these items". The party spent fifteen minutes talking to her, assuming she'd suffered trauma of some sort. Then the bard played a song to see if he could get a reaction from her. He rolled high, so the DM let the little girl shed a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SingleTear">Single Tear</a>. The party's response: they fell in love with her on the spot, declaring her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">the cutest thing ever</a> and deciding to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImTakingHerHomeWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImTakingHerHomeWithMe">keep her</a></em>. The little girl kept going back to the items, so the party eventually went back, gave them to her, and <em>then</em> took her with them. The DM, conceding defeat, arranged for her to gain a mind of her own, and the party made her their mascot, naming her Noh (as that was her response when asked what her name was).
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jCj1M9cEoV_YZX_ePd1NZtj0lTIw_mZEG6KivYzI0NU/edit">Five Fathers Adventuring party<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has a similar story as Noh.

Thus, said player decides to get some revenge of his own by creating Old Man Henderson, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnySchizophrenia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnySchizophrenia">schizophrenic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner">stoner</a> who thinks he served in Vietnam despite being too young to have actually done so, randomly lapses in and out of a Scottish accent despite not being Scottish, and is convinced that the local cult of Hastur (who he initially assumes are Mormons) stole his massive collection of lawn gnomes (he actually donated them to charity, then got high and forgot about it). He had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoorStopper">320-page backstory</a> that justified all of Henderson's many, many skills (and was deliberately made to be so long nobody would ever bother to read it, so the player could add new skills to it whenever he wanted). His weed smoking and schizophrenia together made him almost if not completely immune to SAN loss, since he would simply brush off any eldritch horrors as mere hallucinations caused by the weed/schizophrenia/both.

Sometimes, when players go entirely against the grain, entire storylines can be derailed; an arc's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> underwent a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> because a mass movement of Dragon Clan players flatly refused to use corrupted decks, despite the Dragon Clan cards of that era being designed to support a corruption-heavy playstyle.
<ul><li> The example given above is a strange case of recursive Off The Rails. Players expect that their collective behavior (as a clan) at tournaments to be reflected in future story lines. When the story team went Off The Rails by making their clan champion the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> and their clan corrupt despite not having any such behavior reflected in previous tournaments, the Dragon clan players went Off The Rails in response.

In a psionics-heavy Pathfinder game (plot was that magic was fading away and psionics were becoming more common), a lone wizard manages to completely and utterly wreck the game by not only destroying the Plane of Force (by opening a permanent gate to where the planes of Void and Negative Energy meet, causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox">considerable planar distress</a>), thereby rendering all psionics (including the campaign's Big Bad) completely useless, but also managing to take away the psychic power away from the Big Bad again after the DM already gave him his powers back (by luring him into a plane of his own making, where psionic powers were useless), and finally killing the Big Bad after the DM gave him his powers back a second time with his personal crafting constructs.

The setting was a nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> with a 'Corruption Points' mechanic representing how far characters had fallen. One character, a kindly fisherman, ends up grabbing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCrystal">Power Crystal</a> that gives its wielder godlike power, but multiplies their Corruption Points by 100.

<ul><li> Actually a double case of Off The Rails. By the time the PCs got to the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he'd already grabbed the aforementioned crystal and was ascending to godhood. The PCs were supposed to have stopped him before he could get to this point, and the fight should have been unwinnable... except for something the GM had forgotten. Each PC had a special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> ability that could activate when the PC was under extreme emotional stress, and these circumstances were easily enough to allow the fisherman to enter his Limit Break state for the very first time in the entire campaign. And in that state, he got a combat multiplier equal to <em>1.5x the corruption of the most corrupted thing on the field</em>. Which, of course, was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, whose already huge corruption of 750 was now <em>75,000</em> after grabbing the crystal. This gave the fisherman a combat multiplier of <em>112,500</em>, allowing him to win the supposedly unwinnable fight with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in <em>The Valley of Dust and Fire</em>, a module for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkSun">Dark Sun</a></em> setting. Properly played, the Dragon of Tyr should be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">impossible for a bunch of plucky PCs to kill</a>, and its death would completely wreck the setting. However, the book mentions that a PC group is probably going to try, and might even succeed with a generous DM, and says "okay, but you're on your own if you want to play something this insane out."
</li><li> This trope is frequently enforced by the rules of RPGs created by community members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheForge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheForge">The Forge (2019)</a>, for example, both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Sorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Sorcerer">Sorcerer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ApocalypseWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ApocalypseWorld">Apocalypse World</a></em> explicitly forbid the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> from writing out an entire campaign, instead asking them to think about "bangs" (<em>possible</em> situations where players might have to make a hard choice—instead of encounters in a fixed sequence) and "threats" (characters or world aspects that may make life for the PCs difficult in short or long term), respectively. Effectively, the games advocate throwing the game Off The Rails from session 0.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a></em>, also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PoweredByTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PoweredByTheApocalypse">Powered by the Apocalypse</a>, downplays this: in addition to regular "threats", each scenario must have a "Mystery Countdown"—a linear sequence of increasingly evil acts the Monster will carry out if the player characters don't prevent them. However, the book also warns against sticking to it too closely, as the Hunters' interference with the Monster normally makes it abort or alter the latter steps of the countdown (usually by shifting its aim from its original objective to killing those pesky Hunters). In other words, every scenario starts on the rails but is fully expected to go off-track by the midpoint.
</li><li> One particularly tragic tale is of <a class="urllink" href="http://weekendlegends.tumblr.com/post/157511390771/doomsday-mages">The Doomsday Mages.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> For years, the GM had been getting his hopes up over his homemade concept for a sect of villains.

In the sequel, it happens no less than three times: first, when Wheatley derails GLaDOS' plans to murder you; second, when Wheatley manages to derail his own plans before they even get started by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">smashing you into the elevator shaft and dropping you into Old Aperture</span>; third, when you escape <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wheatley</span>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTrap">Death Trap</a> in "The Part Where..."
<ul><li> Given that escaping GLaDOS's lab in the original <em>Portal</em> requires the player to make extensive use of the Portal Gun (which GLaDOS's test chambers have been training the player character to use for the entire game), there is a popular fan theory that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGameNeverStopped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGameNeverStopped">The Game Never Stopped</a>, which would make it a subversion of this trope.

While you're given a script for the movies, deviating from them can change the film. You can either get a bad ending, which ends badly and is received poorly by fans, or you get a Strange ending, which derails the story into something else entirely, and end with an-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">Shocking Swerve</a> ending. Sometimes your changes get so off-topic that it barely resembles the point of the movie: the strange ending to the first Giant Woman movie ends with her <em>not</em> becoming a giant woman at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>'s plot involves talking to about a dozen NPCs, each directing you to the next NPC, until you meet the one person who can unlock the door to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Citadel</span>.

If you do, the quests to help Zion will immediately fail and a new quest, "Chaos in Zion" will start - it consists of you getting one of the maps Daniel drew so that you can find your way back to the Mojave Wasteland.

However, you can kill Maggie Chow before you even speak to her.
</li><li> The sequel does this much more. The player can kill anybody they have access to, assuming they have at a functional weapon on them, no matter how important this person is, and the plot adapts. In fact, at one point you can trap two characters who the global society depends on in a room, and irradiate them to death.

While there is a story that comes from doing exactly what the narrator tells you to do, (which, ironically, is about a man who frees himself from a mind-controlling machine) the vast majority of the game's content, multiple endings and entertainment value comes from going repeatedly off the rails. Depending on when and what you do, the narrator/GM will try to cajole, threaten or manipulate the player into returning to the main story path, try to create new story narratives, mock the player character, mock the <em>player</em>, encourage the player to strike out randomly to see what you find, break down in despair at your unwillingness to play ball, attempt to destroy the game world, plead with you to prevent <em>you</em> from destroying the game world, and generally get more erratic the further you go. Ultimately averted though, as there's no major action that the player can make that narrator has nothing to say about. The whole point of the game is to zigzag this trope on a meta level.
<ul><li> This makes the moments where the game does not have narration to cover a situation stand out all the more as glitches. One notable example would be jumping down to the bottom floor of the cargo room.

The characters let their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a> be killed by the main villain, left him dead, and after they killed the villain resurrected him and joined his side. The end result is the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>.
</li><li> The second one took place between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, this time run by female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoleplayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoleplayer">Roleplayer</a> Annie as the GM. Her planned campaign would've been the plot to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series, but the players, with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> mentality at the first sight of vampires and werewolves, turned it into the plot for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing">Van Helsing</a></em>.
</li><li> The third campaign was run by Jim between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>. Nothing was derailed in terms of the plot, but he intended the campaign to be very serious and dramatic while the players took it to be hilarious. It's revealed he tried to do <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroHour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ZeroHour">Zero Hour</a></em> and ended up with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airplane">Airplane!</a></em>.
</li><li> The fourth campaign with Ben as the GM, taking place between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">The Empire Strikes Back</a></em>. Ben had planned a campy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">Lighter and Softer</a> superhero spoof where the players were supposed to be a team of superheroes trying to catch a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">masked vigilante</a> who was going around beating up criminals, and the plot would've been the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AdamWest">Adam West</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">Batman (1966)</a></em> TV series. But the players decided to lure the vigilante out in the open by becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedHero">criminals themselves</a>, and the end result was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightTrilogy">The Dark Knight Trilogy</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> A couple of the "alternate" strips go Off the Rails:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">Magicians &amp; Munchkins</a></em>, everybody decides to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">Min-Maxing</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">Munchkin</a>, including the GM, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> is an all-powerful Wicked Witch with the drawback of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness">Vulnerability to Water</a>". Which the players accidentally discover 3 Sessions earlier than the GM intended them to.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">Trenchcoats &amp; Turncoats</a></em>, Ilsa and Victor are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCommunists">Dirty Communists</a> who steal the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">plans</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">escape on the plane</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealMan">Jim (as Rick)</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">dumb enough</a> to believe their cover story that they're Americans despite the facts that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoleplayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoleplayer">Annie (as Ilsa)</a> speaks with a thick Russian accent and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoonie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoonie">Sally (as Victor)</a> only speaks in stock Russian phrases. But what really gets the GM <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">frothing at the mouth</a> is that he'd intended the campaign to be an epic, exciting, globe-spanning adventure but the players hardly ever left <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllMeetInAnInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAllMeetInAnInn">the bar where they all met in.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In a non-canon strip, Jim uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish">Summon Bigger Fish</a> and doesn't take it back thus killing the queen and her retinue.
</li><li> An out-of-universe example is the killing of Greedo senior, thus making the "Greedo" from Episode IV "Han Solo" and "Han Solo" "Greedo". This is not unusual for the comic due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> and the players doing the unexpected. Other examples usually have to do with killing characters the GM doesn't want them to (i.e. General Grievous), killing characters they weren't supposed to (Darth Maul/Zam Wesell), killing character's before they were supposed to (Jango Fett), not taking the obvious hints to go to someplace or do something (which inadvertently sends Boba Fett to want revenge and Naboo being defeated), etc. Several times the GM made very detailed maps of an area just to have the players go through the center of the Earth or book someplace weird.
</li></ul></li><li> By contrast, the webcomic that inspired <em>Darths and Droids</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DMOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DMOfTheRings">DM of the Rings</a></em>, features a scenario where every single attempt by the players at getting Off the Rails is met by either failure or cruel retaliation on the part of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Railroading">Railroading</a> GM.
<ul><li> The DM does face a problem when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legolas kills Gollum</span> early on. And later on they even get to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">kill Grí­ma Wormtongue and Saruman</span>.
<ul><li> In a smaller example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoleplayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRoleplayer">Gimli's player</a> manages to derail <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GMPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GMPC">Gandalf's</a> battle against the Balrog by pointing out that it would be against their alignments to squander the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, meaning the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSpeech">Final Speech</a> the GM had written up for that scene goes unused while the Fellowship legs it. Since Gandalf is the over-powered character played by the GM, he gets payback by resurrecting him later in the campaign (with a high power boost), much to the annoyance of the players.
</li></ul></li><li> There is one major success: the hobbit players all get sick of this treatment and leave the game. The DM has to scramble to build some new rails for the remaining players to follow. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He ends up playing the Hobbits himself in the background, meaning the final battle comes down to a single will save by a non player character who isn't in the scene.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/IrregularWebcomic">Irregular Webcomic!</a></em> has two of its storylines being characters in roleplaying games. When time travel is introduced into both storylines, the PCs quickly disrupt the timeline, preventing events that for them have already happened from happening, resulting in paradoxes that contribute to the destruction of all reality. It should be noted that the DM was dead at the time (his disappearance is noticed in the "Space" storyline), so he was unable to prevent this catastrophic derailment.
</li><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="http://as.crowdedstreet.net/something/">Burning Stickman Presents...Something!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, one of the protagonists knocks the plot, which had been a retelling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em>, off the rails by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="urllink" href="http://as.crowdedstreet.net/something/209.html">stopping Zero from killing Colonel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">lampshaded</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWatcher">The Watcher</a> character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">dropping the F-bomb</a> when he finds this out.</span>
</li><li> Once the second part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> begins it becomes clear there is something terribly wrong with the kid's game of Sburb. Later parts reveal that multiple, connected sessions have gone the same way, with over-powered villains running about and people dying that shouldn't. But there is always ambiguity right up until the end of the comic whether the game is genuinely off the rails, or that the game is deliberately testing how well the players can keep up.
<ul><li> A number of events have conspired to doom the kids' <em>Sburb</em> session: Jack, who was meant to offer a means of helping the players dethrone the Black Queen before the Reckoning, gained access to a.) a weapon of unbelievable power, b.) nigh-omnipotence, and c.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">complete insanity</a>, and immediately began to destroy not just the Sburb session he originated in but also <em>other</em> sessions. Having learned that their game was doomed, Rose searches for a way to break the game because winning it in the traditional fashion is no longer possible. It appears that, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">in the future</a>, she is ultimately successful.
</li><li> After scratching the original session, the new session afterward went Off the Rails before the game even started. The agents of Derse are killing dreamselves before the game in violation of the normal rules, and someone has repeatedly tried to assassinate Jane on Earth. It got further Off the Rails when due to circumstance none of the post-scratch kids prototyped their sprites before entering the Medium, which causes the Battlefield to never fully form and the game to be nearly completely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>.
<ul><li> It later is revealed that some of these events were the result of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Troll Empress infiltrating the session and taking the place of the black queen before the game started, planning to claim the new universe for herself.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> And then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caliborn</span> manages to take the cake by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">attempting to play all by himself, which turns the Medium into a desolate dead place. Caliborn isn't very worried since Hussie informed him that it was like playing in the highest difficulty setting.</span> Aranea claims that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caliborn's species</span> was never meant to play Sburb at all, so not only did the game go off the rails the moment <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caliborn &amp; Calliope</span> entered the game, it went off <em>because</em> the game began. This is supported by the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caliborn &amp; Calliope</span> were naturally born instead of being paradox clones, destined to play the game because they were created by the game like all the other players.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> revealed that in most game sessions, Wayward Vagabond is supposed to serve as a "back door" of sorts who aids the players in defeating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">the Black King</a> if things go too far off the rails. This is why he revolts against the Black King during the kids session; the game was trying to help the kids get things back on track. This failed and only caused things to derail even more spectacularly.
</li><li> Andrew Hussie's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> explains during the comic that their are three different classes of derailment that can happen to a Sburb session.
<ul><li> A Null session has the potential to create a new universe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">but the players are doomed by fate to fail.</a> This happened to the Pre-Scratch troll session due to Doc Scratch putting a glitch in the game that caused the ectobiology lab to fail to appear, thus preventing the players from being born, and so they were forced by fate to invoke the Scratch in order to correct the paradox. This also happened to the Pre-Scratch human session due to Karkat giving the human universe cancer by failing to find the last frog needed to create the genesis tadpole, and this cancer was personified in the form of the overpowered Jack Noir, who prevented the Post-Scratch troll players from entering the human universe and later destroyed the human universe.
</li><li> A Void session occurs when none of the player put anything to the Kernelsprites before entering the game, which is what happened to the Post-Scratch human session. This results in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessGame">Endless Game</a> because the battlefield never forms. The only possible way to complete a void session and create a new universe is for the missing parts of the game to be brought in from another session. Although in the case of the Post-Scratch human session, the game might not have been off the rails at all because the game already knew that they would fail to prototype the Kernelspites and would get help from the Pre-Scratch human session, as none of the players were assigned to the space or time aspect required to complete the game, and the towers on Prospit and Derse and the queen's rings didn't even have the orbs to receive the prototypings, and long dead consorts in the game were aware that new players were destined to arrive to help the players.
</li><li> A Dead session happens when a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> player tries to play the game alone by killing the other players and their dreamselves before the game is started</span> as in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caliborn</span>'s case. Unlike a Void session, it is completely impossible for a dead session to create a new universe, as it causes Skaia to turn black, and they are designed to be completely unwinnable. Dead sessions exist mainly exist to punish the players who start them. Players in dead session are forced to chose between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrificing themselves for the good of the universe</a> or attempting an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> challenge that will reward them with great power. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Caliborn</span> only managed to win because 1: his character class gave him a big advantage, 2: three of the planets that he needed to destroy as part of the unwinnable challenge managed to fall into the black hole by themselves, and 3: he had the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> explaining everything to him.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHomestuckEpilogues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHomestuckEpilogues">The Homestuck Epilogues</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Homestuck2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Homestuck2">Homestuck2</a></em> involve one timeline that is rendered non-canonical by a character's actions, resulting in characterization and events unraveling at a cosmic level, essentially turning the universe into a series of fanfiction tropes. The other timeline which preserved its own canonicity involves another character deciding that the only way not to fall into narrative oblivion is to keep the story alive by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">becoming its antagonist</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A very common plot seen with the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/KnightsOfTheDinnerTable">Knights of the Dinner Table</a></em> comics. In some strips they manage to go off the rails before the adventure <em>starts</em> because they refuse to listen to they guy who's supposed to tell them what the adventure is. In one, after they've stolen the king's silverware during a banquet and therefore had a huge battle with the guards rather than be sent on a quest, B.A. finally storms off after Bob says the adventure was much better than he expected, and Brian recommends he get the other modules in that series.
<ul><li> We also see such gems as:
<ul><li> Brian trying to take out a nemesis by throwing a sack containing 47 12-ounce bottles of nitroglycerine. The result is mistaken in-universe for a meteor strike.
</li><li> Sarah gets a chance to run the top-of-the-line module Adventure To Castle Lonely, only for the players to refuse to even go to the castle and run off chasing squirrels. And, to add insult to injury, then complain about how badly written the module is.
</li><li> Brian shooting Bob's new character for no discernible reason.
</li><li> The party defeating a dungeon by sweeping all the traps with animals.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Happens quite a lot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FullFrontalNerdity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/FullFrontalNerdity">Full Frontal Nerdity</a></em>, as evidenced by the current page image. A(nother) good example would be <a class="urllink" href="http://ffn.nodwick.com/?p=436">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> At one point Frank turned this against them by setting up a campaign where successful power-gaming required them to spend a large amount of time role-playing. When they realized he had planned them going off the rails from the start, they went <em>further</em> off the rails by deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a>.
</li><li> Nelson once <em>stole the campaign</em> when Frank stated that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">the returning long-lost king</a>, by giving the other two characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MontyHaul">Monty Haul</a> missions and such good items that "Even your <em>socks</em> will be +5 Weapons".
</li><li> As a result of their growing familiarity with (and contempt for) each other, Frank and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> players have begun to undergo negotiations about how much off-the-rails is acceptable whenever someone (usually Nelson) smells a rat. <a class="urllink" href="http://ffn.nodwick.com/?p=1306">This eventually gets lampshaded<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The very first thing that happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld">Erfworld</a></em>. One faction finds one more jewel than they were planned to, which lets them buy an extra unit, which turns a critical battle, which sets the actual plot in motion.
</li><li> At the start of the second game session of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LarpTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LarpTrek">Larp Trek</a></em>, before Geordi (the GM) can even open his mouth, Picard and Wesley get a murder mystery going.
<div class="indent"><strong>Picard</strong>: Geordi, were the holodeck's usual safety protocols disabled? <br/><strong>Geordi</strong>: Don't look at me, Captain. I wasn't even on this train when it left the station.

The campaign was supposed to go on for years, but she did all this in the <em>first session</em>. Worse, she did it all <em>completely</em> in-character, meaning the DM can't come up with a good excuse to disallow any of it.
</li><li> When the parasprites show up, she immediately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">kills them off before they can multiply.</a>

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheSpoonyExperiment">Spoony</a> has several stories about this happening in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CounterMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CounterMonkey">Counter Monkey</a></em> videos.
<ul><li> In Spoony's story about <a class="urllink" href="http://spoonyexperiment.com/2011/10/20/counter-monkey-vegan-steve-and-the-djinni-of-jengai-fomogo/">Vegan Steve and the Deck of Many Things<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a living testament to this: Spoony had based his campaign around cursing the player characters to turn into mindless animals unless they find a Genie within a week and wish to be cured. However, when they finally summon the spirit and it offers them a wish, Vegan Steve shouts: "I wish for a Deck of Many Things!" After all the other players try to murder his character in retribution, he runs off, pulling cards off the deck at random. Miraculously getting nothing but positive cards allowing him to escape, only to instantly die when he pulls his last card.
</li><li> In a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampire: The Requiem</a></em> LARP, Spoony wanted to play a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> character, but was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading">forced into joining the local</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">Church Militant</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailRoading">sect</a> by the other players and the Game Master refused to do anything about it. His response was to use his character's extensive knowledge of chemistry to produce enough plastic explosive to level a city block, then snuck it into the local Prince's sanctum. Making it even better, he did it all within the rules, and the Game Master was too lazy or clueless to catch on until it was too late. He was kicked out of the game, but he felt it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthIt">worth it</a>.
<div class="indent"> <em>"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">Victory for the Carthians, bitch</a>"</em>
</div></li><li> In his "All Jedi or No Jedi" video, Spoony also tells the story of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> game he ran, where he decided to have Darth Vader cameo... which, unfortunately for him, inspired the players to completely abandon their previous mission and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LordBritishPostulate">focus entirely on trying to kill the Dark Lord of the Sith</a>. He says this taught him the hard lesson that you do <em>not</em> include established characters in an RPG, lest such an event happen.
</li><li> In his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThievesWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThievesWorld">Thieves' World</a></em> story, Spoony relates the tale of a campaign that accidentally went off the rails when a character impulsively flung an acid flask at a figure entering through a door in a cultist's lair - and ended up hitting the party's benefactor, a semi-immortal champion of the setting's god of war, burning off half his face. Proving that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreNotBad">Tropes Are Not Bad</a>, Spoony managed to run with this and changed the campaign so that the benefactor became the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, and the players earned several awesome moments by using their brains, wits, and skills to best the man at practically every turn, becoming crime lords and eventually leaders of a rebellion that manages to kill the guy (at least temporarily, but by the time he came back they'd be long dead of old age). The players were not even supposed to raid the cultist's layer at all. Spoony had intended for them to only investigate the lair, not attack it all by themselves, as it had been designed to be too difficult for the players to beat without help, but they managed to beat it anyway by using a lot of careful planning. Having their benefactor show up at that moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">was Spoony's way of trying to </a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyWrong">get the story back on the rails.</a>
</li><li> Then there was his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>: The Code" story, where what should have been a routine breaking and entering job at a low-security museum got out of hand thanks to a tripped alarm. The PCs quickly show their true colors by barricading themselves inside the museum, taking hostages, and then <em>executing</em> the hostages for seemingly no reason other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForTheEvulz">they found it funny</a>; that, and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">They saw our faces!</a>". After killing all the hostages and placing enough explosives to take out a city block, the players escaped through the sewers...and ran smack into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk">Cyber Psycho Squad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">Spoony's righteous wrath in human form</a>.
</li><li> In his "Sorbo the Conquerer" video he tells a story about a group of players who are attacked by cultists in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TownWithADarkSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TownWithADarkSecret">Town with a Dark Secret</a>. The players fail to kill their attackers quickly enough and one escapes and raises the alarm, causing the entire town to come after the players with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">Torches and Pitchforks</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">In desperation,</a> the players pull out their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">Talking Weapon</a>, Willy the Wand of Wonder, and the dice roll lands on "An angry rhinoceros appears." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhinoRampage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhinoRampage">Said rhinoceros charges the mob and tramples them and then demolishes the town</a>, wrecking the entire adventure.
<div class="indent"> <em>"It makes most games shorter when you drop a rhino on it"</em>
</div></li><li> Sometimes it's not player choice, but cruel fate that derails games: In "Botchamania", Spoony relates the story of a <em>Spycraft</em> campaign he ran where the players were supposed to rappel from a helicopter onto a high-speed train, but due to a streak of spectacularly bad dice rolls, the more athletic party members died either from failing to make the jump or from their allies' botched attempts to bandage them up, leaving them with precisely nobody capable of boarding the train. And bear in mind that this was <em>with</em> Spoony fudging things to give the players as many chances as possible to try and salvage the plot.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> The 2012 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/D20Live" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/D20Live">D 20 Live</a></em> campaign fell off the rails early on, when the players all refused the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulNeutral">Lawful Neutral</a> alignment the DM gave them. And later on, they challenge a colossal black dragon all on their own (and win!) when the DM expected them to return to the city, warn the head of the local guild and return with an army.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/NerdCubed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/NerdCubed">Nerd³</a> managed to do this to himself in a solo play session.

He was forced to improv an end to the series by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">trying to get a T-rex to the highest mountain peak he could find</span>.

<ul><li> In Chapter 2 Session 3, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossBattle">Boss Battle</a> against a vampiric fallen Paladin was thrown off from the very beginning. The party was in the room fighting another vampire while the Paladin's armored "corpse" was hanging from a giant crucifix on the ceiling. Grant tried to use Ezra's fire ring against the vampire, but he missed and instead hit the "corpse", which caused it to scream in pain and reveal that it was actually alive. When the Paladin came down to fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> Zito rolled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">three Natural 1s in a row</a>, which caused the vampire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySkid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlipperySkid">slip on the ball bearings Ezra had thrown on the floor</a>, hitting the bottom of the ship so hard that he broke through it and quickly sank to the bottom of the ocean. Needless to say, Zito asked for a few minutes to collect himself, then let out a giant "DAMMIT!" after he'd gotten off-camera.
</li><li> In Session 4 the party comes across an island with no intelligent life but a disturbing number of deer. After they make landfall, Lanipator has his character Wake lure one deer close with a handful of grass...and then kill it with a punch to the head, prompting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThousandYardStare">Thousand-Yard Stare</a> from the DM, Zito. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the island is under a Wendigo's druid curse and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKillItYouBoughtIt">anyone who kills a deer becomes one</a>, and Zito specifically intended that the PCs would be unaffected by it so they could investigate.</span> The group rolls with it even after Zito admits what happened in a post-session wrap-up.
</li><li> Session 6 has the party confronting the villain behind all this, but instead of an epic boss battle Eloy manages to nail <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Wendigo</span> with Hypnotic Pattern, leaving him stupefied for a full minute. The team takes the opportunity to stuff the villain's clothing full of explosives, douse them in oil, and light it up; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">the subsequent explosion</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiClimaxBoss">one-shots the boss</a>. Subverted in that Zito was okay with this, since the players earned the victory with their skills and equipment, unlike the vampire Paladin fight above which was just terrible luck on his part and wasted all the effort he'd spent planning it out.

<ul><li> The Shadow of the Northern Planes campaign ended with all the players including T quitting at the climax because they were sick of the DM making them go through long and repetitive battles and not listening to criticism and so the heroes are assumed to have all died and failed to stop the world from ending. T was unsatisfied with this ending so he asked someone else to take over the story, beginning a new campaign called The Ouroboros Contract. The new DM turned the story into a much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> tale about trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">unleash a world ending monster</a> to stop another, hoping they will kill each other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The players succeed but the world still ends.</span> T then takes over the story as DM with a different group of players, and starts The Goddess Wheel campaign, so he could end the story on a happy ending.

They first tried to assassinate the villain by shooting him with a gun during a speech and would have killed him but the player didn't add the amount of damage correctly so the dungeon master ruled that he lived. Angered by this, the player then used a wish they had earned in a previous game to turn the villain to dust. This ruined the dungeon master's plans for the rest of the campaign.

He then proceeds to try and win the entire war, up to and including forcing then-President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> to recognize the Confederacy as a soverign nation; he <em>almost</em> succeeded, but Stan and Kyle forced things back onto the rails by dressing up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> and Jefferson Davis and acting out the Confederacy's surrender.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfWinnieThePooh">The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh</a></em>:
<ul><li> One episode has Pooh narrate the story of the Three Little Pig(let)s that quickly descends into chaos when Pooh, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">being Pooh</a>, keeps on slipping honey references in there and Tigger keeps on trying to "improve" the story. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Rabbit</a> makes a valiant effort to keep the story on track, but it all ends in a spectactular explosion of rain clouds and honey geysers. Literally.
<ul><li> Another episode had basically the same plot only Piglet is trying to tell a story about a scientist, but Tigger thinks the story isn't exciting enough and turns the story into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>, with a giant Pooh as the monster.
</li></ul></li><li> In another episode where the gang are actors in a western play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">without a fourth wall</a>, the plot goes off the rails for a twist ending. Earlier when Piglet was afraid of confronting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, he was reassured that Pooh was scripted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">save him in the end</a>, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion">Foregone Conclusion</a>. This does not happened due to Pooh having an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> which wasn't in the script (and involved going off the rails rather literally in a mine cart). Just before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> beats up Piglet, Piglet's sheriff badge falls off, which causes the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> to conclude through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">Insane Troll Logic</a> that now he can't beat up Piglet, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NowWhat">doesn't know what to do next</a>. Piglet offers to let the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> be sheriff now, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">he happily accepts and turns on his gang, scaring them all off and saving the town</a>, saying that he had always wanted to be sheriff.

The boys keep asking Orson to change the characters into things like ninjas or monsters, but Orson puts a stop to that for the most part. Then Wade (who played the miller's daughter) butted in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">had the daughter be changed to a son</a>, and as a result, the price to be paid became the son's VCR. Things really got crazy and devolved into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonBiggerFish">Summon Bigger Fish</a> duel when the miller's son was about to guess Rumpelstiltskin's name because Roy (a Super Hero-style Rumpelstiltskin) tried to alter the ending in his character's favor, much to the protest of Wade and Orson:
<div class="indent"><strong>Roy</strong>: But before the duck son could say the name, a hurricane came up! <br/><strong>Orson</strong>: A, a hurricane? <br/><strong>Roy</strong>: Yes, a hurricane that blew the duck away so he couldn't take his VCR back. <br/><strong>Wade</strong>: Uno momento! <br/><strong>Orson</strong>: Guys... <br/><strong>Wade</strong>: Then, a spaceship came by, and it rescued the handsome duck, and flew him back to reclaim his VCR! <br/><strong>Orson</strong>: Guys, stop this. <br/><strong>Roy</strong>: But the rooster was determined to get it back with the aid of his, uh, trained dinosaurs! <br/><strong>Orson</strong>: <em>Trained dinosaurs</em>? Where did the trained dinosaurs come from? <br/><strong>Roy</strong>: Same place all those ninjas came from. <br/><strong>Wade</strong>: But then the Third Marine Division landed, with their Anti-Trained-Dinosaur Squadron! <br/><strong>Roy</strong>: But the Mole People were too smart for the Marines! <br/><strong>Orson</strong>: Guys! <br/><em>(a few minutes later)</em> <br/><strong>Wade</strong>: —Then eighty-three monsters take the VCR back! <br/><strong>Roy</strong>: Then eighty-<em>four</em> monsters and a giant moth grab it back from the duck!

In the process, he comes across the disgraced troops his ancestor led and switches them into the reenactment so they can "defeat" the opposing side and get their dignity back.

This isn't actually part of the story, as throughout the film several of the actors have gotten sick forcing Wilma to step in, so she's <em>supposed</em> to be playing two different characters, but Fred intentionally runs with this even though it goes against the plot as an in-character way of trying to apologize to Wilma for being so selfish and thick-headed earlier in the day.

The game is obviously rigged against Bojack as Bojack only gets hard questions while the other contestant only gets easy questions. During a commercial break, Princess Carolyn points out to Bojack that he can tell what the correct answers are on the multiple choice questions by watching Mr. Peanutbutter's ears. Bojack gets every question right after that and ends up in first place.
