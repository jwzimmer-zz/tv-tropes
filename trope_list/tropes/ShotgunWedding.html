Whoops, didn't quite turn out like you figured, eh? Her old man found out, and now you and Daisy Mae are standing in an altar at a rural church, with your petulant in-laws pointing a nice long (and loaded) shotgun at your back. There's no escape. No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> are going to rush in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace">rescue you in a dramatic overblown fashion</a>.

</p><p>Oh well, at least Daisy Mae is <em>somewhat</em> pretty... for a girl with only one tooth.
</p><p>The traditional Shotgun Wedding (replete with gun-toting relatives) is a common staple of comedies set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">rural, "hillbilly" areas</a>. Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityMouse">big-city fellers</a> who wander into such areas had best be discreet about any "minglin'" they do with the local womenfolk, lest they find themselves being forced to stay a lot longer than they had intended. And God help them if the farmer's daughter suddenly gets knocked up in that one-night stand. They may be shot <em>before</em> they get dragged to the altar. Female main characters must also take care when journeying into these kinds of areas, lest an affair forces them to stay as well.

One of the local boys or girls may take a shine to a traveling protagonist and attempt a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndNowYouMustMarryMe">forced marriage</a> at gunpoint. In cases like these, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">Big Damn Heroes</a> are much more likely to jump in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeakNowOrForeverHoldYourPeace">save the day</a>. But if you got into this situation by sowing your wild oats a little too freely, then you're pretty much on your own.
</p><p>Nowadays, a "shotgun wedding" seldom involves actual firearms; the phrase is a euphemistic way to refer to any marriage that occurs upon learning that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawOfInverseFertility">the bride is pregnant</a>. (When characters in older media talk about "having" to get married, this is what they mean.) The parents may not be incensed nor the prospective groom unwilling, but there is still a sense of compulsion involved, since the couple may not have married so soon — or at all — if not for the unexpected pregnancy. In fact, if an actual shotgun <em>is</em> involved, the unwilling groom can usually have the marriage annulled by reason of duress (because "they had a gun to my head" is the textbook definition of duress). In fact, in the Catholic Church, a six-to-nine-month preparation program called Pre-Cana is required of any who seek marriage, with one of the stated goals being to weed out such shotgun marriages. Coercive weddings are further forbidden in Canon Law.

However, he can remain in good graces without marrying her if he's active in raising the kids, and most people today agree that it's better for all parties that the parents <em>not</em> marry if they're only in it for the kids and not their own relationship. However, this trope is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for more socially conservative parts of the world.
</p><p>If the wedding effectively happened when the groom (or bride) wasn't looking, it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalMarriage">Accidental Marriage</a>.

<ul><li> The trope is more universal than you'd think. One notable episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em> finds Godai (in a daydream sequence) facing the father of his sometime girlfriend Kozue over his shotgun. Granted it <em>was</em> a dream sequence, and he was just thinking of <em>kissing</em> her, and her daddy was a pretty clean cut (if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">overly protective</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Salaryman">salaryman</a>. Everything else matched.
<ul><li> This actually happens toward the end of the series has Coach Mitaka learn "she" got pregnant the night <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOjou">Asuna Kujou</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DidTheyOrDidntThey">stayed at his apartment</a>. He promises to set things right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant">only to learn</a> that the "she" in question was her dog (the father being his dog, of course). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They go through with the wedding anyway.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamisamaKiss">Kamisama Kiss</a></em> has Mizuki trying to do this to Nanami. He doesn't succeed and is nearly killed by Nanami's bodyguard and familiar, Tomoe.
</li><li> This happens to Nagasumi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyBrideIsAMermaid">My Bride is a Mermaid</a></em>, when he's accidentally splashes liquid on Lunar and transforms her legs into her fish tail. He helps to dry her off, but just as he's finishing up, Lunar's papa bursts in and the only thing he sees is Nagasumi touching his daughter's butt. Before Nagasumi even gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">chance to explain</a>, he's hauled off and forced to undergo a wedding to marry Lunar or he will be killed right on the spot. When a girl's father is the Terminator, you <em>cannot</em> say no.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionYozakuraFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissionYozakuraFamily">Mission: Yozakura Family</a>,</em> Taiyo is targeted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Kyoichiro</a> for assassination for the crime of being Mutsumi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a>. Despite the Yozakuras' best efforts to stop Kyoichiro, Taiyo decides that the best way to protect himself and Mutsumi is to agree to marry into the family to exploit its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe">Ape Shall Never Kill Ape</a> rule. Kyoichiro even tries to stop them by binding Taiyo's hand with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss">Razor Floss</a>, only to be taken completely by surprise when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">he grips it in order to get Mutsumi's ring around his finger.</a> Unlike most examples of this trope, the relationship is a happy one despite Mutsumi's hesitation over Taiyo's long-standing trauma.

We later learn his fiancee committed suicide after being jilted at the altar. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It turns out Jake had nothing to do with it.

</li><li> As a sort of inversion, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a></em> story arc in 1998 where he is trapped in four different realities at the same time, the Superman of the Bronze Age reality is forced to be a minister to a marriage between the Prankster and Lana Lang when he threatens her with a corsage lined with needles ready to inject a poison into her that would kill her instantly. Fortunately, with the help of Lois Lane stowing away on board a helicopter manned by the Prankster's henchmen, Superman safely removes the corsage from Lana's chest and saves her from the forced marriage.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsILayDying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AsILayDying">As I Lay Dying</a></em> has this idea <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>. Dewey Dell is faced with this prospect, as due to being a 17-year-old girl in the Great Depression, and 17 years old. She spends the entire journey attempting to find an abortion doctor, but majority of them tell her to go home and marry the boy who impregnated her or, in the case of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGowan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGowan">Mac Gowan</a>, try to rape her. However, due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> theme of the story, it is debatable if Dewey Dell is even pregnant to begin with, due to growing up in the South during the Great Depression, being mostly ignored by her siblings and parents, and naive and immature. If true, this would count as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as women who grow up with low nutritional standards tend to skip their menstrual cycles, but still get all the symptoms of a period, which is already similar to a pregnancy.

She saw the wedding party head for the church with the bride's father holding tight to the groom's arm. She figures that Johanna's problem was not having any male relatives who could force the boy to marry her. The omniscient narrator reveals that the boy did want to marry Johanna, but <em>his</em> parents told him not to.

Of course Reily's original expectation that Harcourt would resign her commission and abandon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures">Lily</a> probably did not help.

</li><li> Jude Fawley in <em>Jude The Obscure</em> marries the girl he didn't knock up but thought he did. He later divorces her. And then he marries her again, because he'd promised (possibly - she'd got him to be very drunk.)

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, if a man slept with a woman who was <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">betrothed to someone else</a>, and someone found out, he legally was required to pay her father (or nearest male relative if her father was dead) the customary bride price and take her as his wife. He could not divorce her, no matter what. Note that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">this also applied to some cases where the woman was raped, not seduced</a>. This was to provide for any child they may have conceived (a very real possibility in an era with no condoms, Pill, diaphragms, etc.) and to protect the reputation of the woman's family (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairForItsDay">it also protected the woman</a>, who would be considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiledForever">Defiled Forever</a>, ensuring that someone would be able to support her).
<ul><li> Note that this law bound only the man; the woman could refuse to marry him.
</li><li> Not made totally clear in the Bible, but supported by documentation of the era: The "brideprice" belonged to the woman in case of her husband's death or divorce. Her father kept it for her, to keep it out of the hands of her in-laws. In this case, the brideprice was roughly five years' worth of a middle-class income, and, yes, she could still refuse to marry the man. The only situation when the father could spend the brideprice was if the woman was 'sold as a slave' and, in fact, that's what 'selling her as a slave' meant; the husband was then not allowed to divorce her, because she had no money or property to fall back upon. Earlier in the Bible, Rachel and Leah claim that their father Laban 'sold them into slavery' because he had consumed their brideprices (years of work done for him by their husband).

</li><li> The Maeve Binchy book <em>Silver Wedding</em> was about the life of a couple whose 25th anniversary was approaching. Flashbacks to their younger days revealed that everyone assumed their wedding was one of these, given that they had not been dating long and the ceremony was very rapidly planned and carried out. However, the trope appeared to be averted when the woman did <em>not</em> give birth 9 months after the wedding and their behavior was attributed to simply being madly in love and wanting to marry as soon as possible. Until a family friend recalled trying to visit the couple shortly after their wedding and being turned away because the wife wasn't feeling well. She suddenly realizes that the woman must have miscarried, meaning that the trope was played straight after all.

They have several days of mutually pleasurable sexual relations. He is terrified when he is re-captured and read a long list of charges for his sexual relations with her. However, he is overjoyed when he finds this trope applies, because she also loves him, and, in fact, the "shotgun wedding" was the desired outcome from Anna, the King and the King's other sons.

</li><li> Inversion. Sometimes the shotgun was pointed in the other direction. It was not unknown for a dowryless couple who wished to get married to preempt matchmaking negotiations by engaging in "marital activities" and then announcing it to force people's hand.

</li><li> Good old Rodrigo Borgia, later known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">Pope Alexander VI</a> inverted it. He knocked women up, but being a cleric he could not get married to them. So what to do in order to have his children legitimized (just in case he would turn one of them into a cleric)? Married the mothers of his children off, sometimes before, often enough after they got pregnant. Since the child would officially count as the mother's husband's child.

</li><li> This is the reason many men in NATO Affiliated countries end up enlisted when they would otherwise stay out. The reasons for this are pretty simple:
<ul><li> A Paycheck: The second you ship for Basic Training, you start getting paid, with an expected paycheck twice a month.
</li><li> Skill-Training: Many of those in the average new-enlistment age-group (18-24), are either working a small-time, minimum wage job, or are working an unskilled labor job. Even if the enlistee only stays in for a short period of time, their job-skill training and experience makes it easier to get a job that pays enough to take care of a family.
</li><li> Benefits: Medical? Check. Dental? Check. And the best part is, those benefits apply to not only the soldier, but his family as well. This also applies to college (in the US Military that is), as the military will pay for college both for the soldier, and their family.
</li><li> Housing: Soldiers with a pregnant wife are bumped up to the top of the waiting list for housing. At the very least, they will get the equivalent of a two-bedroom apartment until a house is made available for them.

However, get her agitated enough, and they resurface. Plus all the hormones that go with being pregnant (with twins). Of course, both of them are criminals, so as soon as their names are entered into the database, they have to run as every single cop on their planet is after them.

Andy Renko spends most of the episode angsting about the fact that his girlfriend -who he hadn't been seeing all that long- has just found out she's pregnant, which neither of them are really dealing with too well, especially because she's given him an ultimatum; if he can't or won't take her as his wife, she's having an abortion. He's still chewing on that when he ends up responding to a shots-fired call to the headquarters of Los Diabolos, the gang led by Captain Furillo's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyEnemy">Friendly Enemy</a> Jesus Martinez. The perpetrator turns out to be Martinez's heavily pregnant girlfriend, who would like him to quit procrastinating about fulfilling his promise to offer her honourable marriage. The judge who's supposed to be trying her for a firearms offence ends up conducting a civil wedding in his office... with Renko loaning Martinez a ring for the purpose! You might well ask if this is really the basis for a stable and happy relationship, but the next time Jesus shows up at Hill Street Station he's resigned the gang, enrolled in night-school and is making an honest effort to go straight.
