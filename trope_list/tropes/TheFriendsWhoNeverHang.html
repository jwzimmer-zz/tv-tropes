Naturally an ensemble cast allows for several different smaller pairings within the larger grouping. This mixing and matching allows for the audience to see the interconnectivity of each of the characters' lives on one another. It also allows for different storylines to showcase how one character may relate to another by giving them their own subplot, even if it's just for an episode or two.

This is usually due to the writers being stumped on what to do with the two characters when they're alone together because they lack a certain chemistry. Maybe it's because of the way that the two characters are crafted in that they are too dissimilar from each other to be plausible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoGuys">Those Two Guys</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>, but not so different that they could make an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple">Odd Couple</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>, or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">Foils</a> in general.

For the most part it's only in TV-land that people with full-time jobs (be it as a professional or as a housewife) can hang out together all the time. In real life, you have to actively <em>make</em> time for that.
</p><p>Instances of this trope can be especially detrimental if one or more characters become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">Spotlight-Stealing Squad</a>, and as a result only the cast members they usually interact with are utilized as foils while those they failed to gain chemistry with are ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> due to not having enough relation to the usual recurring cast.

<ul><li> Almost half the crew in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AzumangaDaioh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AzumangaDaioh">Azumanga Daioh</a></em> never interact. Tomo, Yomi and the teachers hardly interact with Sakaki, Kagura, or Kaorin, among other pairings. Despite that, they're all still friends that spend their days off together.
</li><li> Yamato/Matt and Mimi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> are the most infamous case, since they never had a plot together, nor do they ever speak to each other. It stands out because they <em>do</em> have some shared interests (Mimi has a beautiful singing voice and Yamato sings and plays bass in a band) and they get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipsThatPassInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipsThatPassInTheNight">shipped quite a bit</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventureTri">Digimon Adventure tri.</a></em> has them finally interact for once.
</li><li> Implied with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">According to some supplemental material</a> for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">non-canon</a> movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoTheMovieRoadToNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoTheMovieRoadToNinja">Road to Ninja</a></em>, Naruto is often alone when not on a mission, to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">he makes shadow clones of himself just to have someone to talk to</a>, and is overjoyed when Lee convinces the other guys to invite him to simply hang out. Granted, it's implied he's often on other missions with his colleagues between arcs, but we rarely see opportunities to see them hang out when "off the clock". Fortunately, between the end of the Fourth Shinobi World War and the epilogue of the manga (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NarutoHiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NarutoHiden">Naruto Hiden</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last</a></em> in canon; the various omake in the anime), Naruto is often seen hanging out with many of the other members of the Konoha 12 (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Sai</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Lee</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Shikamaru</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTrueLove">Hinata</a> in particular), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">meaning he would not have to be alone</a>.
</li><li> Serena and Clemont in the <em>XY</em> series of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. While all the members of the group talk to each other, these two interact with each other the least and never have plots together. To a lesser extent, Ash and Bonnie don't interact much, either. All other dynamics get much more spotlight.
<ul><li> This changes during the <em>XYZ</em> arc, where Ash becomes more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Big Brother Mentor</a> to Bonnie and Clemont and Serena have a few more moments together. Most of this is restricted to their mutual concern for Bonnie, but during a dancing ball episode, they do dance with each other.
</li><li> Dawn and Brock in <em>Diamond and Pearl</em>. Whereas Brock and Ash had a decade-long bond, and a lot of focus was put into Ash and Dawn due to them being co-leads, the interactions with Brock and Dawn were mostly contained to a few episodes and never really brought up.
</li><li> Among the Pokémon themselves, this trope is surprisingly common. Aside from group lunches and the occasional "all the Pokémon get separated from their trainers" episode, they have historically had very few stories, recurring or otherwise, showcasing their friendships with each other. However, this been averted more and more in later sagas, especially notable from Unova onward. Before then, notable aversions included the friendship between Pikachu and Togepi, and much later Piplup. Another early subversion is the friendship between Ash's Bulbasaur and Squirtle. The <em>XY</em> series also averts this with Ash's team, which has a good number of episodes dedicated to the individual Pokémon bonding. For example: Ash's Froakie and Hawlucha spend an episode learning how to work together, Fletchinder and especially Hawlucha both become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherMentor">Big Brother Mentor</a> to baby Noibat, and Frogadier and Talonflame team up for a Gym Battle. The <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> series also downplays this by having the entire protagonist squad's Pokemon out of their balls routinely.
</li></ul></li><li> Rei and Minako in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> anime barely interact, aside from Rei occasionally getting exasperated with Minako. This is in stark contrast with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">manga</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PrettyGuardianSailorMoon">live action</a>, as Rei and Minako in those versions are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">rivals</a>. As well, Minako spends a lot less time with Ami in nearly all versions of Sailor Moon. Minako is most often paired with Rei/Usagi in the manga/PGSM/Crystal, and with Makoto/Usagi in the original anime. Ami is most often paired with Usagi (PGSM) or Makoto (manga, Crystal, and the original anime).
</li><li> While most of the main girls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuruYuri">Yuru-Yuri</a></em> have shared at least one skit with each other, the interactions between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Akari</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Ayano</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteAndPsycho">Chinatsu</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriFan">Chitose</a> are nearly/completely non-existent. While this could be justifiable due to the fact that they aren't together in any of the main groups (Amusement Club/Student Council or First/Second Grade), the fact that both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosplayOtakuGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosplayOtakuGirl">Kyouko</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Yui</a> have interacted or shared time with either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DCupDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DCupDistress">Himawari</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlacker">Sakurako</a> (which share the same characteristics of not being together in any of the main groups) makes it a lot more jarring. Thankfully averted in Chapter 95 of the manga, where Akari, Chinatsu, Ayano and Chitose share a small skit together at the Amusement Club.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Otaku">Choromatsu</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">Ichimatsu</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OsomatsuSan">Osomatsu-san</a></em> rarely interact despite being brothers who have lived together their entire lives. In the second season they get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode">bottle episode</a> fittingly titled "Ichimatsu and Choromatsu" that's entirely about their strained relationship, with the two finding it uncomfortable to be around each other after being left home alone.
</li><li> During her tenure on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em> Jounouchi's sister Shizuka has almost no interaction with Yugi. Her interactions are mostly with her brother, with Honda and Otogi due to the love triangle that exists, and with Mai and Anzu due to them being the other girls in the group.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em>:
<ul><li> The dragon characters frequently interact as a group but, on their own, usually only socialize with Tohru or the humans of their acquaintance. Chapter 61, however, has the normally very anti-social Fafnir seek out Lucoa, who's typically only seen with either Tohru or Shouta, for help as a model for the manga he wants to draw.
</li><li> The <em>Kanna's Daily Life</em> spinoff rectifies this with Kanna. In the main series, she interacts primarily with the others in the Kobayashi household and her classmates. The spinoff features chapters such as she and Saikawa finding Fafnir's secret arcade and bribing Lucoa for help. A main series chapter has Elma taking Kanna, Saikawa, and Shouta fishing.
</li></ul></li><li> While they might not always get devoted chapters to their relationships (Fujiwara with either of the freshmen for example), all of the members of the student council in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> do demonstrate unique relationships with one another... except for Shirogane and Iino. This gets lampshaded in chapter 165 (literally a hundred chapters after they first met) when they are alone in the student council room together, and Shirogane realizes he has no idea how to interact with her, leading to awkward attempts at small talk.
</li><li> Goku and Chiaotzu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> never directly talk to each other.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSentry">The Sentry</a> from Marvel comics was often stated to be best friends with nearly every hero especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Reed Richards</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IncredibleHulk">the Hulk</a> going so far as being the best man at the wedding of the former.

Justified, since Barry really doesn't like Oliver, what with considering him a bad influence on Hal, with his anti-authoritarian views, not to mention all the times Oliver has made Hal doubt himself. Likewise, Oliver dislikes Barry for being a police officer, as he considers cops "blue fascists." Never mind that Barry is a CSI, not a beat cop, Oliver still doesn't like him.

He's had conversations with Max Mercury and Johnny Quick, and in the Rebirth era he's the centre of the 'new' Flash family and so he gets screentime with Wallace (who like Wallace's cousin Wally, Barry tries to be a surrogate dad to), Avery (who he briefly counsels and mentors), Godspeed (his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilFormerFriend">Evil Former Friend</a> turned loose antihero), and Meena (who he briefly dated).

They work together (mostly off-screen) to track down Boba Fett and plan Han's rescue from Jabba the Hutt's palace, but after that, Luke has his own adventures to deal with while Lando stays with the Rebel fleet. Amusingly enough, <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> mentioned that Luke and Lando travelled together for a time after the events of the original trilogy when Luke was researching Force artefacts.
</li><li> In the prequel trilogy, Obi-Wan and Padmé don't have much screentime together, reflecting the two worlds Anakin has to choose between (i.e. a normal life and family vs the Chosen One of the Jedi). The few times they are together, it's always professional, and Obi-Wan coming to her to find Anakin in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> indicates how bad things have gotten.

Note that all of these relationships involve a character introduced late in the show's run - there simply wasn't as much time to explore potential relationships, especially since a lot of time had to be devoted to establishing the ones that <em>did</em> happen (primarily Eric/Jack, Shawn/Angela, Eric/Rachel, Jack/Rachel, Topanga/Angela, and Angela/Rachel). The gulf between the "old guard" characters and the newer characters actually became a plot point in "The War" and "Seven the Hard Way" in the seventh season - notably, the rift is healed by Eric, who functions as a "bridge" between the two camps - a member of the old guard who mostly interacts with the newer characters.
</li><li> In a variant on this trope, Angela is the only character in the core group of students who never has any one-on-one interactions with Mr. Feeny. This is made all the more jarring when her <em>father</em> visits Pennbrook in one episode and immediately makes a beeline to him, asking for advice about his daughter.

<ul><li> The page quote is from Season 1's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E04SocialPsychology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CommunityS1E04SocialPsychology">Social Psychology</a>. Abed lampshades the lack of plotlines between him and Annie using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Phoebe and Chandler as an example.</a> This is also a bit of parody of the trope because this was only four episodes into the series so no clear relationships had been solidly established with the characters anyway. This becomes less true as they become something like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Platonic Life-Partners</a> later in the show.
</li><li> Shirley and Troy didn't have a B-Plot together until the fourth season. Yvette-Nicole Brown (Shirley's actress) noted this in the DVD commmentary for a season three episode where Troy gave a heartfelt goodbye to Shirley, although the two never spent time together on-screen. They also rarely spoke to one another directly even when the group was all together around the study room.
</li><li> Shirley and Jeff intentionally invoke this because it was established in their first episode together that they were really toxic to one another. This is brought to light again in season 2 where the two almost conspired to get Chang imprisoned for the rest of his life. The third season episode "Foosball and Nocturnal Vigilantism" had a Jeff and Shirley pairing that seemed to resolve their issues and later in the season the two spend an episode together without resulting in them becoming horrible people.
</li><li> Abed and Pierce haven't spent too much time together, but this seems to be at least partially intentional on Abed's end because, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaGuy">Abed</a> puts it, he doesn't find Pierce all that compelling as a character.
</li><li> In season 2 Jeff tries to throw Abed a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PulpFiction">Pulp Fiction</a></em> themed party for his birthday but is derailed by a special <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyDinnerWithAndre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyDinnerWithAndre">My Dinner with Andre</a></em>"</span> dinner that Abed set up for just the two of them. Abed's reasoning for the dinner was that it seemed that he and Jeff hadn't spent much time together in their second year as opposed to their first year when they had more shenanigans with each other.
</li><li> You never see much of Abed and Britta together until Season 3, after Britta decides to be Abed's therapist.
</li><li> One episode in Season 5 points out that Jeff and Duncan, despite being the two characters that have known each other for the longest, don't really act like friends. The episode ends with them making a more concerted effort in their friendship.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>:
<ul><li> Joey and Monica, which is ironic since they were meant to be the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>. In the entire show they have stories together (without Chandler or other friends) in only four episodes.
</li><li> Ross and Phoebe, especially in early seasons. Later in the series they hang out more often, especially in season 9, while still being kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Buds</a>. She does genuinely try to console him with a hug in the finale when Rachel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> decides to board the plane to Paris.</span>
</li><li> Chandler is most subject to this trope, having few stories with Phoebe and Rachel. Early seasons have him almost exclusively paired with Joey and sometimes Ross. From Season 5 he has storylines with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetaCouple">Monica</a> or is back with Joey. Somewhat explained in the commentary when the writers talk about the three most iconic relationships of the show (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Ross/Rachel</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Chandler/Monica</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Chandler/Joey</a>) and Chandler is tied up in two of them. Being part of two such significant dynamics meant Chandler's stories were more exclusive.
<ul><li> Chandler and Phoebe, as evidenced by the page quote. They spend more time hanging out before Chandler starts dating Monica, then they don't seem to like each other so much. "The One With The Ring" is the only Chandler/Phoebe episode in later seasons. Though notably, when allowed to choose the name for one of her brother's unborn children, she chooses the name Chandler, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Phoebe gets married, Chandler is the one who walks her down the aisle.</span>
</li><li> Chandler and Rachel. They are quite good friends in season 4 when they are often seen together without the other friends. However from Season 5 onwards they rarely interact, with the cheesecake episode in season 7 being the <em>only</em> exception.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, Chandler and Monica in early seasons. Before their impulsive one-night stand in London leads to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">Secret Relationship</a>, they rarely have storylines without the other friends in first four seasons, although their few interactions <em>are</em> pretty meaningful and emotional ("The One With The Birth", "The One With The Flashback", "The One With The Jellyfish"). Besides these episodes, they also have a storyline in the season 2 episode "The One Where Ross Finds Out" where Monica becomes Chandler's personal trainer, but they fight throughout the entire episode.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite being brother and sister, Ross and Monica rarely had stories with just the two of them after Monica begins dating Chandler. They grew up together, so there wasn't much new territory for their relationship.
</li><li> In early seasons Joey and Rachel played it straight but in the second half of the show they developed a much more significant relationship. Again makes sense as it coincided with the Chandler/Monica relationship and before then Joey/Chandler and Rachel/Monica were the two most common storyline pairs. The Chandler/Monica pairing up opened a obvious niche for them
</li><li> Another odd example is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriends">Monica and Rachel</a> in later seasons. In seasons 1-5, they were the second most prominent friendship after Joey/Chandler, but from season 6 onwards (after "The One On The Last Night") they almost never have one-on-one interactions. In contrast to Joey/Chandler who, while not inseparable as they were early on, still get a decent number of storylines in later seasons. This is somewhat justified since season 6 is when Rachel moves out of Monica's apartment so Chandler can move in.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FullHouse">Full House</a></em>: Kimmy Gibbler is a downplayed example, mostly because she is DJ's friend while everyone else in the house hates her. She also has some significant interaction with Jesse and Stephanie, but rarely interacts with Danny, Michelle, or Rebecca, and you could count the number of times she interacts with Joey over the course of the series on one hand. Aside from one babysitting side plot, she also never has any real interaction with the twins.
<ul><li> Joey and Rebecca interact occasionally, but never really have stories together.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow">The George Lopez Show</a></em>: While the Lopez family do tend to interact a fair amount with each other, Carmen and Benny don't seem to interact much. Same goes for Carmen and Vic. She's not very good with her grandparents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>: The Glee club consider each other family, however with up to and sometimes over 12 kids in the Glee club at any given time, it would be downright impossible to develop strong friendships between all the characters.
<ul><li> Blaine Anderson never seemed to hang out with anybody in the club upon his arrival in Season 3. He mainly hung around with boyfriend Kurt at the start of the year, only expanding his relationships with others in the last half of the season. By Season 4, he becomes very good friends with Sam &amp; Tina as well as having friendly moments with Artie, Brittany, Ryder, Jake and Marley.
</li><li> Considering that they're meant to be in the Unholy Trinity together with Santana, the characters of Brittany and Quinn never really hung out.
</li><li> Rachel and Puck become this in Season 3, which seemed strange as the first two seasons had developed an odd but charming friendship between the pair.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em> that had an episode where Robin and Marshall hung out solely because they realized that they had never hung out one-on-one together (which is actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> as there was an episode prior where they hung out together at a Minnesota-themed bar Marshall frequents).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WillAndGrace">Will &amp; Grace</a></em>: Jack/Grace and Will/Karen, though both pairings have a few moments, the show doesn't focus much on their interactions. In one episode of season 8 Will and Karen lampshades this trope when they are alone.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyEndings">Happy Endings</a></em> had an episode in which siblings-in-law Brad and Alex have the exact same problem as Robin and Marshall; in this instance their interaction is encouraged by Jane, Brad's wife/Alex's sister.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>. Dennis and Charlie rarely have storylines together without Mac or Frank acting as an intermediary between the two. In the show's storyline, Mac and Charlie were childhood friends and only met Dennis in high school. Mac spends more time with Dennis than Charlie does because Mac and Dennis are roommates, while Charlie lives in a hovel with Frank. Almost as rare are storylines with Mac and Dee, as the latter tends to have most of her storylines with Dennis, her twin brother, or Charlie.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></em> episode "The Dog," from Season 3, is one of the first times George and Elaine have to interact without Jerry as a buffer, and they realize that they have nothing in common. They manage to overcome their awkwardness only by gossiping about Jerry, which quickly grows old. (In later seasons, however, George and Elaine have a number of storylines featuring just the two of them.)
<ul><li> Newman and George, who are in some ways quite similar characters, never interact much.
</li></ul></li><li> On the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDickVanDykeShow">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a></em> Laura and Richie have very little contact with each other despite being mother and son. It's so bad that there's a joke that the two never talk, although they do... on occasion.
</li><li> Rimmer and the Cat almost never interacted in the early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>: Rimmer didn't think of the Cat as a person, and the Cat, before he got more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterizationMarchesOn">domesticated</a> later on, had no interest in a man who couldn't feed him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOC">The O.C.</a></em> has Ryan and Summer, and Seth and Marissa. Their personalities clash, and they mostly have scenes with other people. Interestingly enough, the friendship of Seth/Summer/Ryan/Marissa works out pretty well.
</li><li> Eric and Jackie barely had any storylines with only the two of them in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow">That '70s Show</a></em>. While Jackie started out as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a>, eventually the entire gang warmed up to her, and she eventually shared storylines with pretty much all of them... except for Eric, who kept wanting to have nothing to do with her throughout the series.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RulesOfEngagement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RulesOfEngagement">Rules of Engagement</a></em> Russell and Jennifer don't have a plot with just the two of them until the seventh and final season.
<ul><li> There was an earlier episode in which this was lampshaded between Jeff and Jennifer who realized they never hung out until they go shopping for Megyn (in fact, Jeff does not even know Jennifer's last name). This is further lampshaded by Russell, who admitted he rarely hung out with her too, mostly because he would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze">always end up looking at her chest</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> Anya and Tara had barely any close personal interaction despite hanging out together for years in the Scooby Gang and their love interests being best friends with each other, possibly due to their vividly contrasting personalities.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> probably intended Sulu and Chekov to be buddies. These two characters weren't too dissimilar in age and attitudes. However, both seem to be grouped together because they both suffer from being the original series' most prominent satellite characters. In most cases, either got paired up with Uhura instead of together. The fact that they both have the same job doesn't help, as one frequently fills in for the other, meaning they frequently appear without the other.
<ul><li> Rectified somewhat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekGenerations">Star Trek: Generations</a></em>: Chekov is shown to know more of Sulu in his private life as he's the one to introduce Demora Sulu (Hikaru's daughter) to Kirk, who was surprised to learn that Sulu had a family, and at the beginning of <em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em>, Sulu and Chekov are shown to have been hiking in Yosemite together. They also don't seem to have been a part of Kirk, Spock, and Bones's campsite.
</li><li> The portrayal of Sulu and Chekov as friends was initially inhibited by the fact that during the second season (Chekov's first season on the show), due to George Takei simultaneously acting in <em>The Green Berets</em>, they often appeared only in alternate episodes.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> goes the other way with them: they're practically inseparable, and Chekov eventually becomes Sulu's first officer on the <em>Excelsior</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation">Parks and Recreation</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted with Ann and April. Despite April going out of her way to avoid interacting with Ann due to her being Andy's ex, they still have a surprising amount of interaction: Ann is April's nurse when she is sick with the flu, Ann drives April to her vet school tour, and the two of them even have a touching moment in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ann's goodbye episode</span>.
</li><li> Donna has this with Leslie of all people: of all the Parks and Rec staff, they have the least interactions total, and the least amount of scenes (although there was one episode focused on the Leslie-Donna relationship).
</li><li> Outside of Ben's first few appearances in Season 2, we see very little of Ben and Ron together. Which is surprising, considering they're both close to Andy, April and Leslie, and Ron loves cutting expenses, which is Ben's main job as Assistant City Manager
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>:
<ul><li> When Howard and Amy are paired together on a scavenger hunt, they point out that they had never been alone together before. From that point forward, however, they interact more frequently and it's latter shown, when they end up working together, that they do have a good friendship.
</li><li> Amy does play it straight with Leonard and Raj. A season 11 episode lampshades it: Sheldon and Penny mention being, respectively, Amy's fiancé and best friend while the best Leonard can say is that he once gave her a battery.
</li><li> Bernadette rarely interacts with anyone other than Howard and the other two girls. She starts interacting far more often with Raj after she and Howard get married (although she rarely has scenes with Raj alone, if Howard is not involved) but still plays it straight with Leonard and Sheldon.
</li><li> From the original five, it's pretty clear that Howard isn't particularly close to Penny or Sheldon, and the two pairs only tolerate each other. Later on there are storylines every now and then between Sheldon and Howard, but even then they don't seem too close, and even though Howard stops being a pervert to Penny after he gets together with Bernadette, the two never really become close friends.
</li><li> In general, any girl/guy pairing on the show qualifies, except the three couples (Leonard/Penny, Sheldon/Amy, Howard/Bernadette) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a> Sheldon/Penny.
</li></ul></li><li> After season one of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin</a></em>, Arthur and Morgana had barely any scenes with each other. This was partly due to the constraints of the plot, in which Morgana grows ever more isolated, but even once the reveal that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arthur and Morgana were half-siblings</span> occurred, there was never much effort to capitalize on their new relationship.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivingSingle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LivingSingle">Living Single</a></em>, while everyone works well collectively as a group and with Khadijah (given she's the main character), certain members of the group don't seem to have much screen time with one another. This is the case of Overton and any woman not Synclaire and Khadijah, who are his wife and his wife's cousin, respectively, but in particular with Regine. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1i4k9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1i4k9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1i4k9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is ironic since Kim Fields and John Henton dated in real life</span> Then there's also Kyle and Synclaire who didn't have much interaction as well as her and Max, too. That being said, it seems that the aforementioned males have something of a level of contempt for the females and vice versa, even if it only pops up on rare occasions (one episode had Kyle annoyed that Synclaire was invading his shared apartment with Overton once she and the latter began dating, though her eccentricities <em>would</em> annoy any normal person, like using an iron to make a grilled cheese sandwich.)
</li><li> This occasionally happens on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, due to the large cast. For the same reason, they can also be hard to notice.
<ul><li> The most notable example is probably Michonne and Carol. Despite being main characters, they almost <em>never</em> interact with each other. In fact, before Season 9 (in which they finally share a lengthy conversation), the only two times where they're seen together are in "No Sanctuary," when Michonne thanks Carol for saving them all from Terminus, and in "Them," where they are shown hugging in the background, both of which are very minor instances.
</li><li> Daryl and Merle are brothers, but they never appear onscreen together in Season 1. Aside from Merle appearing to Daryl as a hallucination in Season 2's "Chupacabra," they never even see each other until halfway through Season 3 in "Made to Suffer."
</li><li> Glenn has almost no interactions with his sister-in-law Beth.
</li><li> Carol and Eugene have their first real interaction midway through Season 10, when they and a couple of other characters are split off from the rest of the Hilltop group. This is despite the fact that they'd simultaneously been a major part of the show for over half its run by that point,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ly8y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ly8y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ly8y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Carol made her first appearance in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S1E3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S1E3">S 1 E 3</a>, while Eugene joined in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S4E10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/S4E10">S 4 E 10</a>.</span> and are both among the longest-running characters on the show.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girlfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Girlfriends">Girlfriends</a></em>, Joan, Maya and Lynn all get significant one on one time with male friend William throughout the series, but Toni very rarely interacts with William outside of a group. Later, in Season 7 when Monica permanently joins the group (after several guest appearances over several seasons), both Joan and Lynn take several episodes to bury the bad blood between themselves and Monica, leading to quite a few one-on-one interactions between Monica and Joan/Lynn. That did not happen with Maya, despite hating Monica as much as the other two.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast">Ensemble Cast</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> tends to have very interwoven storylines and everyone winds up having at least one storyline together. The exception to this is Buster and Maeby, who speak to each other precisely one time during the entire series: In the season 3 finale "Development Arrested", a brief scene sees Maeby finally speaking to Buster in order to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> get him to sign off on the movie Maeby is trying to make about the family.</span> Aside from this, they share countless scenes together but never actually interact directly a single time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MillionYenWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MillionYenWomen">Million Yen Women</a></em>: Nanaka at some point notices that almost never speaks with Yuki, despite the two of them having lived in the same house for six months. Yuki outright states that she considers Nanaka to be too dimwitted to be worth speaking to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>: Downplayed. It's hard to notice but Piper and Cole don't have any significant one-on-one time until the seventh season. By this point Cole wasn't even a regular on the show anymore and just showed up as a guest character who only interacts with Piper and another guest character for plot reason. Overall they have a lot of scenes where they are both present, but it's usually accompanied by at least one of the sisters and/or Leo. Cole was introduced as a demonic love interest for Phoebe and had the most screen time with her throughout seasons three through five. Paige and Prue both traded off being suspicious of and not liking Cole, but they each have at least one episode where their subplot put them in direct interaction with him. By the middle of season 5 when the character was off the show the most significant scene him and Piper had alone was when they were trying (and failing) to blow the other up, and even then Leo quickly came to break the tension.
<ul><li> Also, regarding the first season: Piper had very little involvement with Andy. He was Prue's love interest and Phoebe went to him a few times for information, but Piper had maybe a handful of scenes with him, and there was almost always someone else present.
</li><li> With Season 6 Paige had the least amount of time one-on-one with Chris. Admittedly her subplots that season tended to skew a little more insular than the rest of the cast as she was in a temp job and jumped from job-to-job with a different magical problem for her to solve every episode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious">Victorious</a></em>: Due to the show's fairly large ensemble some of relationships in the main cast seem closer than others, as Tori and surprisingly Robbie is the only one to have significant plot-lines with everybody. Cat rarely has any storylines with Andre or Beck that don't involve another intermediary, Andre rarely has interactions with Cat or supposed best-friend Beck, Jade doesn't really hang out with anybody besides Cat or Beck despite in group tag-alongs, and Beck rarely has storylines outside Jade or Tori (despite one very memorable episode with Robbie). Jade and Tori's relationship, while a dominant focus throughout the series, rarely has episodes where they actually hang out alone... though some have noted there's a considerably more open and less hostile dynamic between them when they're away from the outside social world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Reba">Reba</a></em>: A family variation. It's very rare to see Cheyenne and Jake interact. The few times they do interact, it's brief, unpleasant and they usually have Van, Kyra or Reba as an intermediary.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> in S7E9: Boyle casually mentions having lunch with Holt, which immediately suggests to Jake that something significant is going on, since they're the "second least likely lunch combination" out of the whole group.

<ul><li> In all but one of the novels of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a>, there is no scene where two male characters are alone together without a woman present. Austen didn't want to speculate on how men behaved on their own. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MansfieldPark">Mansfield Park</a></em> is the exception, with scenes between Sir Thomas and his elder son Tom where they discuss Tom's debts, Sir Thomas and his younger son Edmund talking about the theatre, Edmund's arguments with Tom over said theatre, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>: Despite being in the Fellowship of the Ring together, Legolas is never seen interacting with any of the Hobbits very much, even though two of them are very fond of Elves. Boromir has less interaction with Sam than the rest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroesOfOlympus">The Heroes of Olympus</a></em> follows the journey of seven separate POV characters, plus their occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Sixth Ranger</a> (mostly Nico). This trope was bound to happen, and it does: while most of the demigods develop significant friendships and/or romantic relationships with each other, Frank and Piper have the least interaction. Hazel and Jason are a close second. Piper and Hazel would count if not for their last-minute bonding in <em>House of Hades</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em>, there's only really one scene where Ford and Trillian directly interact one-on-one (when they're in the Magrathean catalog with an unconscious Zaphod). Perhaps it's because they both tend to be more competent and less quirky than the other characters, and therefore can pretty much happily ignore each other.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em>, while most pairs of main characters receive at least a few Z-skits of dialogue with each other, there is precious little interaction between Raine and Presea. Colette and Regal don't interact very much, either, apart from one endgame skit involving the two of them and Lloyd.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em>:

That said, some of them really don't like each other, and it's only the circumstances of the Blight which keep them in proximity at all.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, where various characters can be seen hanging out at each other's places; for example, Hawke may visit Anders to find Varric is just leaving, or can drop by Aveline's office in time to see her chatting with Isabela. There are even moments indicating that they have interactions with lesser characters (for instance, if you save the little elf girl from the serial killer in Act 1, she ends up joining the city guard under Aveline in Act 3). Played straight in the case of Hawke's sibling, who always leaves the party at the end of Act 1 in one way or another<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note384tx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note384tx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note384tx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you don't take them to the Deep Roads, Bethany will be forced to join the Circle, while Carver joins the Templars.

If she is recruited before the Inquisition moves to Skyhold, but you don't interact with her until after the move, or if you recruit her after the move and don't speak to her at the first opportunity, she gets tetchy with you about ignoring her.
</li></ul></li><li> With a cast of nine main characters (sorta, depending on how you consider team colors) who seem to fairly friendly with each other within their teams, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> tends to pretty fair with its cast in terms of screen time, but a clear pattern of groups has formed after seven years, with some serious neglect to non-traditional arrangements. The comics and animated shorts show that they clearly have time off and sometimes do things not involving killing everyone. In spite of this, the limited overlap between the nine of them is surprising in the supplemental material.
<ul><li> Scout is often seen opposite Spy or Soldier, and sometimes Heavy.
</li><li> Soldier gets the most coverage, playing off Scout, Heavy, Demoman, Pyro, and Spy. This is probably because he's a complete nutjob and they're great foils for his idiocy.
</li><li> Pyro only seems to get screen time with Engineer, and a bit with Soldier.
</li><li> Demoman seems to only hang out with Soldier.
</li><li> Heavy is usually seen with Medic, of course, but he also shows up alongside Scout and Soldier as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicTrio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicTrio">Comic Trio</a>.
</li><li> Engineer's only meaningful interactions so far seem to be with Pyro and perhaps Medic.
</li><li> Medic gets screentime with Heavy, naturally, but also a bit with Engineer.
</li><li> Sniper doesn't seem to get a lot in the way of 'hanging out' with any of the others, fittingly enough.
</li><li> Spy gets Scout and Soldier as his major costars.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> series Tails and Cream barely ever communicate with each other.

<ul><li> Ever since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>, more or less every character has been filed into a niche "team" that rarely interacts with the rest of the cast outside of their teams aside from Sonic himself, bordering on being an entire roster of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">SatelliteCharacters</a>.

Particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> with Team Chaotix, since they barely even interacted with the rest of the cast before suddenly being close enough to be invited to Sonic's Birthday party, only to spend the entire party standing by themselves.
<ul><li> In fact, even within the teams themselves this happens. Knuckles and Tails rarely interact nowadays unless it's plot mandated they do, Cream has more or less never spoken a word to Silver despite how close she is to Blaze, All of Team Rose rarely has anything to do with Big unless they need a third wheel, etc. Really, they're all basically just there to talk to Sonic and no one else.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kain and Rydia of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> are not only major characters in the final party, but are two of the biggest ensemble darkhorses and breakout characters of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series in general, gaining them more time and attention in the sequel. They've pretty much never interacted.
</li><li> The winner of this trope in the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>. Despite how much of this game's decades of fame has been spent talking about its characters and story, the reality is that this game was just Squaresoft showing off how many playable characters they could have, branching scenarios and fights, and side quests they could come up with this time around. Only Terra, Locke, Edgar, Celes, Setzer and <em>maybe</em> Sabin have any lasting significance to the plot and therefore the most interactions with each other. Cyan, Gau, Shadow, Mog, Strago and Relm may as well have functioned as just slightly more of a one-shot character than Leo; and Umaro and Gogo are completely irrelevant to the game altogether. Part of the reason for this is that the structure of the game itself is unorthodox - of the 40 hours you would spend doing everything there is to do, only the first 20 hours have conventional plot and progress, the other "half" of the game only involves a few chapters before you get the airship and you can just get to the end dungeon right there. There just isn't room for 12 characters to hang out much with each other when characters become interchangable 10 hours after the start. It's particularly telling that a lot of dialogue that comes from characters do not assign a speaker and are programmed to be just as interchangable. The other half of the game does allow you to explore the other characters more and get some additional rare interactions in side quests and in the ending (one short side quest in particular has the whole group suddenly take a break from their quest to fuss over buying clothes for Gau, the least interacted-with non-optional character in the group), but again it only functions as content for the player, not bringing the group closer to each other. At the end, most are still just strangers that never talk to each other or seem to care.
</li><li> Due to the heavy focus on Cloud in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, a lot of party members never get interactions with one another outside of him.
<ul><li> Barret does best of all, getting juicy scripted interactions with Tifa, Cait Sith, Cid, Yuffie and Red XIII as well as with Cloud; Aerith and Tifa get several scenes together, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBechdelTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBechdelTest">most of them are about Tifa getting jealous of Aerith's relationship with Cloud</a>; Red XIII gets a brief scene with Tifa; Yuffie shows up to argue with Barret during his brief time as party leader; and Vincent at one point tells Cid "let's go back to our rooms". Everything else is only implied at best or entirely absent. At least in both Yuffie's and Vincent's case it comes across as a deliberate character choice (Yuffie seems affectionate towards Cloud but antagonistic towards everyone else; Vincent rarely feels the need to talk).
</li><li> Aerith and Barret don't interact very much considering Aerith got caught up in AVALANCHE by saving the life of Barret's daughter, and they were two of the game's three party members during development for a while. Their main interaction is the scene in the Gold Saucer, where Aerith deliberately antagonises Barret even though he's already in a bad mood and refuses to apologize when Tifa calls her out on it, implying that Aerith doesn't actually like him very much. This is especially prevalent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em>, where they only get one battle together (the Arsenal) and pretty much never have a conversation.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite there being only six main party members in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, we never see much of any sort of group dynamic. Everyone has at least SOME connection to another member of the group, but scenes developing their relationships are sparse at best. You could quite easily play through the entire game with the idea that most of them don't really like each other, and Penelo might as well have just stayed at home for all the impact she has on both the plot and the party.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, Meryl and Otacon never interact, despite being characters so similar that Otacon will play Meryl's role in the ending if she doesn't survive, and despite Meryl's ultimate love interest being a character very similar to Otacon. The original game (not the remake) contains a brief scene where Otacon remarks on how cute Meryl's "behind" is to Snake, meaning he has at least seen her in person; the one time Meryl mentions him, she's apparently really worried about him (again suggesting that they know each other), but since his name hadn't come up in her script at all before, the voice actress mispronounces it. They don't interact in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></em>, where Meryl gets into a romance with Akiba, a character with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotParallel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotParallel">similar nomenclature and personality</a> to Otacon - Otacon is invited to her wedding but spends it lurking around in the corner, chatting to the uninvited Drebin.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntilDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UntilDawn">Until Dawn</a></em>, a game about a close group of friends which is ripe with player choices, two pairings of the eight characters  Sam/Matt and Ashley/Jessica  do not interact a single time in the entire game no matter what choices are made.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em>, Dimitri, Ingrid, Felix, and Sylvain are all long-standing friends, but Dimitri and Sylvain are the only pair of the group not able to A support each other (their supports cap at B), implying they just aren't as close.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, this applies with the male protagonist and most of the male members of SEES besides Junpei. Unlike the fourth and fifth game, the protagonist's only party Social Links are Yukari, Fuuka and Mitsuru, plus Aigis in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Re-release</a>. As a result, the protagonist doesn't spend much time with Akihiko, Ken, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamPet">Koromaru</a> or Shinjiro outside of group meetings, exploring Tartarus or Full Moon operations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Royal</a></em> theres Kasumi Yoshizawa. Despite being advertised as a new teammate to the Phantom Thieves, she only ever spends time with Joker and Akechi. And in the latter's case, it's partially because they already knew each other in passing. This is jarring when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Marie</a> still managed to come across as friends with the other member of the Investigation Team.

While initially they were together most of the time, as the time went on, their storylines started to diverge greatly, with Largo's focusing more on being "Great Teacher Largo", random shenanigans, fighting zombies and building "f34rb0ts", while Piro's went to the exploration of relationships, comparing the reality to fiction, dealing with his emotional baggage and previous relationship with Miho, and just dealing with everyday life, to the point they rarely talked to each other, and when they did they were basically having two different conversations on two different worlds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rose and Jade are seen interacting far less than any other pair of beta kids. This is probably because they are the only two who a) aren't a server-client pair, and b) neither one of them is John (who as the protagonist gets the most screen time — especially in the earlier acts — and gets to talk a lot to everybody regardless of server/client status).
</li><li> Since there are 12 trolls, there are numerous pairs of trolls who never or rarely interacted. Probably the most glaring example is Kanaya and Terezi, who are two of the most important troll characters in the series, as well as two of the less-than-half who survive to the end. They're both quite close to Karkat, and occasional dialogue from each of them suggests that she considers the other among her best friends as well...but they are somehow <em>never</em> shown directly talking to each other one-on-one a single time in the entire story.
</li><li> The B2 (post-Scratch) kids avoided this trope within their group.
</li><li> There's also the "meteor crew", the group that spent 3 years on the trolls' meteor during Act 6. Dave lampshades this trope regarding himself and Kanaya at one point. Also, Karkat and Rose never talked much.
</li><li> The 12 Beforan trolls are even worse, as they're all introduced three to four at a time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveComic">Flash game segments</a>, where the others get cameo appearances if at all. For example, Aranea has only ever interacted with Meenah, and Mituna has never been portrayed speaking to Kurloz nor Latula, who are respectively his best friend and girlfriend.

Among them, Emil and Reynir (the stowaway in question) share no language, religious belief, reasons to work together or desire to be friends, which greatly limits their possibilities of interacting.
<ul><li> From Reynir's point of view, the interactions with Mikkel and Tuuri happen via them being the only other Icelandic speakers on the crew. Lalli doesn't like Reynir very much, but both of them being mages and the only ones able to actually do something about the murderous ghosts that have taken a dislike to the crew keeps their interactions from being non-existent. Sigrun is the commander and shares a religion with Reynir if not a language. This causes her to have a few comments about Reynir's attempts at developping his power (which partly involve getting a little attention from their shared gods) and a couple of incidents before this have given them a few via-translator interaction opportunities.
</li><li> Emil can communicate verbally fairly easily with Tuuri, Sigrun and Mikkel. He has also taken a liking to Lalli despite their lack of shared language that has developed into a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddFriendship">Odd Friendship</a>. His only real visible interactions with Reynir have been Emil treating Reynir as a prisoner upon his arrival at Sigrun's command, and several chapters later insulting him in a moment of frustration because he happened to be right next to him. Otherwise, Emil seems to only even pay attention to Reynir in one type of situation: when both Lalli and Reynir have a completely simultaneous reaction to something that only they can see, giving a little shake to Emil's lack of belief in magic and spirits in the process.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameGrumps">Game Grumps</a></em> has a few examples, but since all of the players hang out regularly off-camera, they're all simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">informed attributes</a> until fleshed out farther.
<ul><li> The first few episodes of <em>Steam Rolled</em> team up Ross and Barry less out of actual chemistry and more out of the fact that Ross's regular partner Danny was too busy being Arin's partner. It didn't help that Barry had been an entirely off-camera presence up until that point, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JonTron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/JonTron">the only person to have established chemistry with him</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">was no longer on the channel</a>.
</li><li> Danny and Suzy have had almost no interaction within the channel itself, as <em>Steam Rolled</em> has a 4-player maximum and Danny is at the lowest priority of attendance due to being the host of two other shows on the channel. The only episode where they're both playing at the same time was only half the length of a normal episode.
</li><li> Barry and Suzy are the hosts of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TableFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TableFlip">Table Flip</a></em> entirely because of fan demands, and even the fan demands were entirely because they were the only two players without their own show to host.
</li><li> Valentine's Day 2014 was dedicated to this, with the <em>Game Grumps</em> episodes of the day starring Arin and Suzy and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SteamTrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/SteamTrain">Steam Train</a></em> episode starring Danny and Barry. This is less significant, as these pairs have had a lot of on-camera interactions and are married/roommates respectively, but these were the first episodes to have the pairs on their own without being distracted by other groups.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sidemen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Sidemen">Sidemen</a> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KSI">Olajide "JJ" Olatunji</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Wroetoshaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Wroetoshaw">Harry Lewis</a>, who both do not frequent with the Sidemen much in any non-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FIFASoccer">FIFA</a></em> videos, especially videos of their <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> sessions. What makes it worse is that they are the two most popular members of the group, and Harry in particular is also their newest member.
<ul><li> For JJ though, he eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">returned to full-time participation with the Sidemen</a>, as he's recording many videos with the Sidemen (reappearing in sessions for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a> Funny Moments</em>, for example) and has even brought his second channel back after being abandoned for many months. Harry, on the other hand, is still rarely joining the Sidemen, with the Sidemen Sunday videos being his only participation in the Sidemen's non-<em>FIFA</em> videos as of now.

Finally, Weiss and Yang have acted as a secondary combat duo on occasion, such as fighting together in the Vytal Tournament in Volume 3.

<ul><li> Luigi doesn't get much one-on-one interactions with SMG4, Toad, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Meggy</a>. He mainly shares his screentime with Mario.
</li><li> Likewise, Peach mostly interacts with Mario since her screentime diminished, this also means she hasn't even spoken to any of the post-2017 additions to the main cast except Axol.
</li><li> Also, SMG4 himself and Meggy don't interact with each other a lot.
</li><li> Speaking of Meggy, she hasnt interacted much with most of the prominent pre-2017 characters, with the only ones being Steve in The Minecraft Plague, Swagmaster in Marios Prison Escape, and a brief interaction with Old Man Hobo in Officer Meggy.
<ul><li> Likewise, Saiko and Tari have only interacted with the Teletubbies in The Mario Purge and the Guards in the Anime Arc; and the former has interacted with SMG3 in The Day SMG4 Posted Cringe<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note85bfo');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note85bfo" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note85bfo');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">neither her nor Tari had a real interaction with him in the YouTube Arc</span> and Peach in My Mario Academia, but that was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> revealed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> created by Axol</span>, and the latter interacted with Steve in 🌽🌽🌽🌽𝓒𝓸𝓻𝓷🌽🌽🌽🌽.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has episodes that pair in some way each of the Titans with another member, with the exception of Beast Boy and Robin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> doesn't give Superboy many opportunities to interact with Kid Flash or Artemis, which is strange since Kid Flash discovered him and Artemis expressed attraction to him.
<ul><li> Rocket gets this even worse. Due to her status as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourRanger">11th-Hour Ranger</a>, she only gets paired with Zatanna. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then she joins the Justice League in season 2.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "Eight Simple Rules For Buying My Teenage Daughter", while Meg is babysitting Stewie, he lampshades that the two generally don't interact much in an awkward attempt at making conversation.
</li><li> Lampshaded again in "And Then There Were Fewer" the party of guests divide into couples to search the mansion. Peter makes groups, among them choosing Dr Hartman and Seamus since they may be interesting as a new chemistry.
</li><li> Brian often has storylines with everyone in the main cast, except for Chris. This is mainly because Chris is generally the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> of the main cast, so plots that focus on him at all are generally not very common. The only subplots he really commonly gets with other characters are with Peter, and maybe a few with Meg. However the crossover <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS13E1TheSimpsonsGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS13E1TheSimpsonsGuy">The Simpsons Guy</a> has a Brian/Chris subplot and in one episode Peter asks Brian to tutor Chris and to be a good role model.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> scenario was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the episode where Brian tries to hang out with Quagmire only to find out Quagmire doesn't like him. Just because everyone hangs out in a group doesn't mean everyone is really friends with each other. They simply have one or more mutual common. This amusingly got averted as episodes passed, since Quagmire and Brian's resentment towards each other was exaggerated into them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis">Sitcom Arch-Nemesis</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers">Bonkers</a></em>, this is a consequence of the show's notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Production</a>. Bonkers has as his friends Fall-Apart Rabbit, Jitters A. Dog, Fawn Deer and Grumbles Grizzly. But because Jitters, Fawn and Grumbles are mostly exclusive to the Miranda Wright episodes (produced first), and Fall-Apart was created for the Lucky Piquel episodes produced later, they only interact in the one episode that bridges the two together, "New Partners on the Block". This is particularly noticeable because Fawn addresses Fall-Apart by name in that episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> Toph lampshades the fact she never got to go on a 'life changing field trip' with Zuko, unlike everyone else. While they get left by themselves a couple of times and you can get a pretty good feel for how they would get along, the fact that Toph joined the cast after Zukos turn as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> and Zuko joined the good guys shortly before the finale winding up hurt them.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel">Interquel</a> comics, its even worse. Zuko is the closest thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderThePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderThePromise">The Promise</a> has to an antagonist, while Toph spends most of her time in an unrelated subplot. In all the subsequent stories, Toph and Zuko alternate joining the adventuring party the only other story theyre both in is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderNorthAndSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvatarTheLastAirbenderNorthAndSouth">North and South</a>, Gene Luen Yangs last turn on writing duties, and Toph doesnt show up until part 2, while Zuko arrives in part 3.
</li><li> Come the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, they seem to have been the least close friends of the group. Most notably, in the Korra comics, Korra tries to get Toph to run for Mayor of her hometown in the Earth Kingdom, and Toph points out that it was Aang, Sokka, and Katara who got involved in politics, not her. This <em>pointedly</em> leaves out Zuko, whose political misadventures are a running subplot in the comics Toph isn't in. Zuko also only retired from his head of state status about seven years before the events of the comics and his daughter, Izumi, now has the job.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, the relationships between Cartman and Stan and between Kyle and Kenny are never really developed as compared to relationships between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis">Cartman and Kyle</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Kyle and Stan</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedWith">Played With</a>: Cartman and Kenny generally don't interact much, but in one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">surprisingly poignant</a> episode, Cartman admits that since Stan and Kyle were best friends, he always considered Kenny his best friend. Another episode reveals that they had declared themselves "Best Friends Forever" years before, although Kenny claims that he did this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">out of pity</a> because Cartman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">alienates everyone else</a>.
</li><li> Cartman and Stan have a storyline in "Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow." Cartman enjoys hanging out with just Stan without "stupid Kyle" around, but they don't seem to do it much.
</li><li> While there have at least been a few exceptions between the four boys, Kenny and Butters barely interact at all. This amusingly came into play in the episode "Going Native", where it is revealed Kenny is actually Butters' favorite friend and the two finally share an entire plot together.

</li><li> Most of the "Steam Team" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThomasTheTankEngine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a></em> have had an episode together within the long run. Edward and Emily have had very little interaction however. Edward also rarely interacts with Toby, likely due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">similarities in character</a> (and even being Flanderized in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat">similar manner</a>).
</li><li> Par some of the feature length specials, Sandy is rarely involved in the antics going on at the Krusty Krab in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em>, so is not seen interacting with Mr. Krabs or Squidward much individually, and is rarely placed against Plankton.
</li><li> Pildit and Spildit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em>, to the point they are never even in a scene together, something that can seem somewhat odd given they are supposedly cousins.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>: Most of the cast have had a short together, sometimes leading to unique dynamics, however, due to some being director specific, a few key stars have not interacted. Special "all star" projects such as the live action movies and <em>The Bugs Bunny Show</em> remedied a few of these.
<ul><li> Notably, Bugs and Porky had little to no interaction in the original shorts.<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow">The Looney Tunes Show</a></em> changed this, and we see them interact with each other much more.

There hasn't been an episode where it focuses on them together although their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterparts</a>, Daffy and Lola, do.

Leading to many episodes being the characters getting used to interacting with each other more and forming new bonds, such as Applejack and Rarity in "Look Before You Sleep". Even so, this trope is still played as straight as you'd expect when you have six main characters:
<ul><li> Pinkie Pie and Rarity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">rarely</a> interact outside of their larger group. Out of the first 109 episodes, there are only four scenes (in the episodes "The Last Roundup," "Putting Your Hoof Down," "Canterlot Boutique," and "The One Where Pinkie Pie Knows") where it's just the two of them without the rest of the cast. It's not until the sixth season that they get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E3TheGiftOfTheMaudPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E3TheGiftOfTheMaudPie">two</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E13SpiceUpYourLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS6E13SpiceUpYourLife">episodes</a> focusing on the two of them as a duo, and their human counterparts are even paired up for the Tri-Cross Relay in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirlsFriendshipGames">Friendship Games</a></em>.

</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Starlight Glimmer</span> is even worse than Spike, who still occasionally gets an unimportant background role. She's supposed to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">learning about friendship as Twilight's pupil and roommate</span>, so it would make a lot of sense for her to be making more of an effort to bond with the mane six, but... well, she's not. Instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsenteeActor">she generally only appears in any given episode if she's important to the plot</a> and even then her only real established relationships are with Twilight, Spike, Trixie, Sunburst, and Pinkie's sister Maud.

"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E9PinkieApplePie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E9PinkieApplePie">Pinkie Apple Pie</a>", "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E14FilliVanilli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS4E14FilliVanilli">Filli Vanilli</a>", and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E5GranniesGoneWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS8E5GranniesGoneWild">Grannies Gone Wild</a>" are the only episodes where Granny Smith and/or Big Mac spend a significant amount of time together with another mane six member who isn't blood related.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em>, the usual way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpGang">the group divides</a> is Fred and Daphne, Shaggy and Scooby, and Velma with either group (or, in rare cases, going alone). This is lampshaded in one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsNewScoobyDoo">What's New, Scooby-Doo?</a></em>, where the group decides to split in a different way for once, with Fred splitting off with Shaggy, only to find they have absolutely no chemistry as a pair.
<div class="indent"><strong>Fred:</strong> So... did you see the game last night?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Shaggy:</strong> Uh, I'm not really into sports.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Fred:</strong> Oh, right...
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Shaggy:</strong> Wanna go get something to eat?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Fred:</strong> No thanks, I'm not hungry.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Shaggy:</strong> Oh...
</div><div class="indent">*short pause*
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Fred:</strong> From now on, let's split up like usual.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Shaggy:</strong> Good plan.
</div><ul><li> Also brought up in the 2002 live-action <em>Scooby-Doo</em> film, in which Velma complains about the usual pairings, leaving her the odd man out. Fred volunteers to be her partner on their current quest, but struggles to carry normal conversation with her. Velma does appreciate the effort after a bit, however.
</li><li> Other than "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The13GhostsOfScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/The13GhostsOfScoobyDoo">The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo</a>", Shaggy and Daphne never have much one-on-one time, due to the aforementioned Fred and Daphne dynamic, though some of the movies do have them interact more often.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess">Recess</a></em>, Gus and Vince hardly interact with each other, compared to them with the other members of the Recess Gang. The same goes with Mikey and Gretchen.
</li><li> With the exception of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a> teamup, the stars of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Classic Disney Shorts</a> barely interact with each other and characters like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipAndDale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChipAndDale">Chip 'n Dale</a> and Humphrey the Bear are exclusively seen with Donald. Shorts on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HouseOfMouse">House of Mouse</a></em> remedy this a bit by having Mickey share the screen with characters like Huey, Dewey and Louie ("Mickey's Remedy"), Chip 'n' Dale ("Mickey's Mixed Nuts") and Jose Carioca ("Mickey Tries to Cook").
<ul><li> Minnie and Daisy were also more or less <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">Satellite Characters</a> to Mickey and Donald respectively until later revivals gave them more individual roles (the two in particular now spend several roles alongside each other).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a></em>, Fred Flintstone always pairs up with his best friend, neighbor, and sidekick, Barney Rubble, and when not with him, he's with his wife, Wilma. The same is said about Betty Rubble, who is also rarely seen without her best friend, Wilma, or her husband, Barney. Now, Wilma and Barney have paired up occasionally, but Fred and Betty have never teamed up together.
<ul><li> However, in the spinoff series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstoneKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstoneKids">The Flintstone Kids</a></em>, Fred and Betty get one episode together ("Freddy the 13th") where they try to purchase some Halloween costumes, but decide to use a pair of abandoned costumes they've found, unaware that a couple of crooks just used those costumes for a robbery.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> acknowledged this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> and would occasionally find ways to remedy it, be it hilariously awkward, like Kif trying to make small talk with Fry while facing certain doom in "The Beast With a Billion Backs," or genuine like Hermes and Bender in "Lethal Inspection."
<ul><li> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParodiedTrope">parodied</a> with Leela and Bender in "Law and Oracle." As two out of the three main characters, they get plenty of interaction throughout the series and have a well-established dynamic... but it turns out that when their mutual friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Fry</a> is gone, they have nothing to say to each other. Keep in mind they've known each other for at least ten years.
<div class="indent"><strong>Leela:</strong> So. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">You're a robot?</a>
</div><div class="indent"><em>[awkwardly long pause]</em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Bender:</strong> <em>...Ugh.</em> <em>(turns and stares out the window)</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> has Marco and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGadfly">Janna</a>. While there are a number of moments throughout the series where the two interact, the only times Marco is seen willingly hanging out with Janna is when one of their mutual friends (usually Star) is also in the room. This is lampshaded in one episode, where Janna responds to Marco's attempts at small talk when they're alone by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">knocking him unconscious with hypnotic suggestion</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution">X-Men: Evolution</a></em>:
<ul><li> Among the main cast, Jean and Kurt and Scott and Kitty probably had the least interaction among the characters, which becomes oddly noticeable thanks to the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Scott an</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">d Jean</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Scott and Kurt</a> were close relationships, as was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Kurt and Kitty</a> and, to a down-played extreme, Kitty and Jean. The first few episodes teased the idea of Jean and Kurt flirting a bit and Kitty gushing over how attractive Scott is, but after that, neither interact one-on-one much (especially notable given Scott's big-brother like protectiveness over his team, Kitty's status as everyone's little sister, and Kitty briefly dating his rival Avalanche, meaning they had potential for him to play a few older brother tropes that he never touched upon with Kitty).
</li><li> Averted with Rogue and everyone, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLoveIsUnrequited">Scott</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">Jean</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddCouple">Kitty</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyAdopted">Kurt</a> all have unique dynamics with Rogue, and played straight with Evan and everyone, to the point he borders on being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a> before being written out.
</li></ul></li><li> It's been pointed out on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> Headscratchers page that Bart and Maggie have very little interaction. They finally get to spend some time together in the episode "How Lisa Got Her Marge Back".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VoltronLegendaryDefender">Voltron: Legendary Defender</a></em>: The Voltron Team is meant to have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, with their bonds being vital to the creation of Voltron, but, with a cast of 7 main characters and only 13 episodes a season, some are more rare than others.
<ul><li> Shiro and Hunk rarely ever talk. It's a bit understandable, as they are very different in terms of action, motivation and personality; still, the lack of interactions between them is quite noticeable. Shiro also spends a minimum of time with Lance, with whom he also has clashing personalities. Mostly, Shiro spent his time in early season 1 with Pidge, in later season 1 with Allura, and lastly, with Keith by season 2.
</li><li> Keith and Pidge had only one significant interaction back in early season 1 and even then, it's unclear what that interaction really was, with the possibility that Keith is either extremely disappointed at Pidge for attempting to leave Voltron or has abandonment issues. (Maybe both.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>: Kevin and Sarah interact a lot with the other four kids but almost never with each other, which is odd considering that they are the two notably antagonistic characters who hate the Eds more than everyone else.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em>, the characters of Dinobot and Airazor were never shown directly talking to each other despite appearing in scenes together in various episodes; various Predacons, such as Scorponok and Inferno, were also rarely shown interacting, but this is more excusable due to their villainous nature making it hard for them to cooperate.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em>:
<ul><li> So far, Donald hasn't interacted with Webby or Launchpad too often. While Donald has been absent for the majority of the episodes (especially in the first season), it still doesn't hold water. Even in her few episodes after returning, his sister Della has bonded more with Webby and Launchpad than Donald has, especially two-for-one in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S2E20TheGoldenArmoryOfCorneliusCoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S2E20TheGoldenArmoryOfCorneliusCoot">The Golden Armory of Cornelius Coot!</a>". Webby is shown to greatly admire Donald as "one of the most daring adventurers of all time" and Donald does hug Webby along with the triplets near the end of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S1E6TheHouseOfTheLuckyGander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S1E6TheHouseOfTheLuckyGander">The House of the Lucky Gander</a>". And Donald is shown to keep a photo of Launchpad in his houseboat in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S2E12NothingCanStopDellaDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S2E12NothingCanStopDellaDuck">Nothing Can Stop Della Duck</a>", so the material is there, it just has yet to be capitalized on. The latter case with Launchpad has been rectified with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S3E10TheTrickening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S3E10TheTrickening">The Trickening</a>" showing the two interacting onscreen for the first time.
</li><li> Dewey and Louie are rarely seen together without having Huey or Webby as an intermediary though this has been rectified with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S3E5LouiesEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S3E5LouiesEleven">Louie's Eleven</a>" giving focus on their relationships without Huey or Webby.
</li><li> Mrs. Beakley has next to no screentime with the boys without Webby as an intermediary. Even in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S3E4TheLostHarpOfMervana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DuckTales2017S3E4TheLostHarpOfMervana">The Lost Harp of Mervana!</a>" where she gets some one on one interactions with Louie, the conversations are still primarily about Webby.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, Lapis Lazuli doesn't get a lot of screen time with characters who aren't Steven, Bismuth, or Peridot, as she only joins the Crystal Gems near the end of the fifth season. She never directly speaks to Garnet, and has a single conversation with Amethyst and Pearl in the whole series (including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseTheMovie">movie</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverseFuture">epilogue season</a>).
