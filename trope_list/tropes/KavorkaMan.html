In fact, he's a sleaze and/or looks like a baboon and/or treats women like garbage.

</p><p>In some cases, the character is treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod">Sex God</a> even by other characters.

This is especially common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">Long Runners</a>, where by nature of the format, even ugly or unpleasant characters tend to accumulate a fair number of love interests, one-off or otherwise.

Men are seen to value a women's appearance more than women do men's, so the idea of a genuinely unattractive woman attracting handsome men is considered 'unrealistic'. The closest common example is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">Big Beautiful Woman</a> who often has numerous conventionally-attractive men vying for her attention (an archetype with historical precedent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineTheGreat">Catherine the Great</a>).
</p><p>The line between Kavorka Man and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>, usually wide, can sometimes be very fine. A Kavorka Man minus the conquests is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a>. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyGuyHotWife">Ugly Guy, Hot Wife</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">All Girls Want Bad Boys</a> is when the ladies are attracted to a man with a seemingly repellent personality rather than repellent looks. Often arises due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy">power's allure</a> or being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexGod">surprisingly good in bed</a>.

Also contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsomeLech">Handsome Lech</a>, which is basically an inversion of the Kavorka Man, a man that's unsuccessful with the ladies despite being attractive.

For some reason, he is surrounded by beautiful women who are constantly yearning to throw themselves at him, whom he feels ambivalent towards. Like everything else in <em>One Piece,</em> this has an explanation: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The reason he rejects the women is that he still considers himself to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> to his wife who is in a vegetative state.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> has had a large number of highly attractive love interests (particularly if they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedHeads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroesWantRedHeads">redheads</a> or Japanese), in addition to having a fairly large female fanbase. This is even though he's a short, hairy lantern-jawed guy with weird hair and a perpetual scowl. Unfortunately, poor Wolvie can never settle down and snuggle because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">his enemies will harm and/or kill them</a>—or he'll just outlive them due to his extreme <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> causing him to age at a much, <em>much</em> slower rate than pretty everyone else. Not only that, but Wolverine also has rather poor hygiene (it's mentioned that he rarely bathes or brushes his teeth). The live-action movies seem to write this out (can't pass up the chance to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HughJackman">Hugh Jackman</a> shower scene). Possibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">justified</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>: Wolvie's son Daken (not an example himself, as he is conventionally attractive) explicitly has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingAphrodisiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingAphrodisiac">conscious pheromone control</a> as one of his mutant powers. It's possible that his father has a less-conscious version going on.
<ul><li> It's also that Wolverine's gruff appearance and brute demeanor belie the fact that he's actually quite brilliant. He's fluent in eight languages and conversational in a dozen more. His world travels, military/espionage training, and great age have allowed him to acquire immense knowledge and skills as well. He doesn't need pheromones to attract women.

</li><li> However, may be deconstructed since Deadpool sometimes never seems to remove his mask when he with some of his ladies. When having sex with Carmelita, he keeps his suit on. He has to leave to fight, and Carmelita wishes him luck and kisses him in case something bad happens to her. She even goes to the fight scene, wondering if Deadpool is ok. However, she'd never seen his face, and when she does, she chokes back bile and runs away in disgust.
</li><li> Granted, his face is only a mess due to injuries. When he gets his face fixed, he is quite handsome looking.

Roger is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> A-list film star with an ego and a temper to match. Jessica's entire showbiz career was appearing in "Tijuana Bibles" (cartoon porn) rather than her rather glamorous nightclub singer gig in the film. Their marriage, while not completely dysfunctional, was significantly rockier and more mercenary in nature than it is in the film.

</li><li> Swanson from Rick Alverson's cult film <em>The Comedy</em> is a hipster jerk with no filter and a large beer gut. He has trysts with three women throughout the film, wooing one of them by brushing his teeth in front of her at work in the most disgusting way possible, and another by delivering a nonsensical monologue about killing slaves and making furniture out of their skin (in a stereotypical plantation owner voice to boot).

He's old enough to be everyone else's "da," and looks every bit like a guy nearing 50 with his weather-beaten face, but his soft-spoken charm wins over the band's three female singers  he's seen kissing one of them, has sex with another, and at least gets the last one, who's engaged to a rather boring man, flirtatious with him. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As all three girls are still smitten with Joey toward the end of the film, this causes their already-tenuous friendship to completely implode, along with the rest of the band.</span>

He apparently had a relationship with John's ex-wife, May at some point before John married her. His widow, Amy is stated to be very beautiful, he briefly dates Ariel (aka.

</li><li> Sir Lancelot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOnceAndFutureKing">The Once and Future King</a></em> by T. H. White. He is known as <em>le Chevalier Mal Fet</em>, "the Ill-Made Knight", as he is short, bow-legged, and catastrophically ugly, to the point of almost being simian. Still, he gets it on with the beautiful Guinevere, just like the traditional myths. Its a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> in his case, though, as hes dedicated his life to being as much of an ideal knight as possible, making him attractive in non-physical ways that most Kavorka Men dont manage to pull off, either.
<ul><li> He also is pursued by Elaine (who was very beautiful when they first met), implicitly because she was smitten with him for saving her.

</li><li> Embarrassingly common in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardboiledDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardboiledDetective">Hardboiled Detective</a> stories. The private eye may be a drunkard, a crackhead, and a self-pitying, self-absorbed fool, but the housewife next door, the beautiful reporter, the mysterious suspect ... in fact, every female character in the book under the age of sixty (or under the age of thirty-five, the sets are equivalent), seeks his tender ministrations.

He's also somewhat misogynistic, and after he's exiled from his position as an <em>apprentice torturer</em>, he takes a paid position as an executioner. The number of women who don't seem to mind is truly impressive. Then again, Severian is an Unreliable Narrator and at least one of his conquests is a possible rape.

He's immensely fat, has a big nose, lives on strong cheese and beer, and takes snuff by the fistful. He's greedy, gluttonous, lecherous, and speaks his own brand of garbled Anglo-Dutch — yet he's constantly surrounded by lovely mistresses. His vast fortune has something to do with it, but he often seduces women by his sheer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam">awesomeness</a> too.
</li><li> Detective Terry Biggs of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LomaxAndBiggs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LomaxAndBiggs">Lomax And Biggs</a></em> is stated to look like a mule.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Havemercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Havemercy">Havemercy</a></em>, we have the almost outright sociopathic Rook, who not only treats women with a brutal kind of scorn but comes very close to killing his new professor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and long-lost brother</span> Thom out of sheer rage; the ladies, including the Esar's niece, are not in the least bit bothered by this. Though admittedly, Rook is described as being almost painfully handsome and with that whole <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys">rugged airman</a> thing going on...
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurHailey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurHailey">Arthur Hailey</a>'s <em>Overload</em> has Nim Goldman, who's on poor terms with his wife. He looks like a middle-aged Judd Hirsch, according to some covers, and has sex with an absurd number of women over the course of the book, including a quadriplegic who still has sensation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">After she dies, he pours out his story about his affair with said woman to a female reporter. She suggests he go home. He says it's too far away. She suggests he come to her place, which is only five minutes away. He barely hesitates before accepting.</span>
</li><li> Ainz Ooal Gown of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Overlord">Overlord</a></em> is a gigantic demon-skeleton with glowing red eyes, not to mention that he has no genitalia whatsoever.

</li><li> Viktor Krum from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series. He's rather ugly, and pretty awkward socially. However, he is a great Quidditch player, and thus has lots of fangirls due to this. He even manages to successfully ask out Hermione, who had said earlier in the book that he wasn't good looking.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dracula">Count Dracula</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dracula">Dracula</a></em>.

However, he has three vampire wives and manages to put several women into his hypnotic spell. He's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyOldMan">Dirty Old Man</a>/sexual predator than the more modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiresAreSexGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampiresAreSexGods">Vampires Are Sex Gods</a> trope.

He still manages to sleep around with several gorgeous women throughout the course of the series. It's mostly that his sheer charisma and force of personality completely overwhelm his physical appearance once you actually get to know him.

He has been described as the "best bang since the big one" by Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple breasted whore of Eroticon Six. He stole Trillian away from Arthur who was unsuccessfully trying to initiate a conversation with her during a party on Earth. Zaphod is not very bright, and was voted several times "The worst dressed sentient being in the known universe." And in adaptations, he's usually played by actors who while not exactly hideous are still not known for being conventional lookers. He may be President of the Galaxy, but he holds no real power whatsoever. His function is solely to direct attention away from those who hold actual power.

He doesn't even seem to need a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy">strong social position</a> to make it work - even when he's imprisoned and disgraced, it's mentioned that there's no end to how many gorgeous women turn up to visit him in his cell.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HoratioHornblower">Horatio Hornblower</a></em> considers himself one. Though he attracts the affections of almost every woman who knows him for more than five minutes, when his first wife is pregnant for the first time he finds himself hoping the child doesn't have his looks, and in books set later in his life, he ruefully contemplates his thinning hair and unthinning figure. However, Hornblower is a thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> when it comes to assessing himself (his other wish for the child is that they don't have his unhappy, self-critical temperament either) so it's debatable how much this trope really applies. The best assessment is probably the first book's neutral description of having a face neither handsome nor ugly. (For what it's worth, Hornblower's been played in film and tv by Gregory Peck and Ioan Gruffudd, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> <em>really</em> comes into play there.)

This is a constant source of puzzlement to Bobby Clark and many of the other male characters.
</li><li> Tony in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArmadilloFists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArmadilloFists">Armadillo Fists</a></em> is fat and ugly. And dresses badly. Oh, and is a <em>quadruple amputee</em>. None of that stops him from being a big hit with the ladies.
</li><li> King Shellar in <em>Strange Kingdom Chronicles</em> by Oksana Pankeeva. One of the first things we learn about him is that he is ugly. And until he learned to express some positive emotions, he looked outright frightening. Nevertheless, two women almost go into a fistfight at his bedroom door, Olga admitted that in different circumstances she would seriously consider marrying him, queen Dana actually agreed to marry him if he doesn't mind her being infertile (unfortunately, being a king, he has to) and, when he eventually marries, his wife is a gorgeous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner">Statuesque Stunner</a>, although with a scar from a battle. Neither of those women had any desire to become a queen (except for Dana who already was one).

Over the course of the show, he's seduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmaThurman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmaThurman">Uma Thurman</a>, a very devout nun, and a lesbian, offering no explanation other than, "I'm Kramer." This was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> on the episode that named it since he couldn't control the effect and almost destroyed the aforementioned nun's life against his own will, as she was willing to abandon the church just to sleep with him.
</li><li> George also qualifies and has also been lampshaded. When George can't have sex with his girlfriend, he gets smarter. Jerry theorizes that George has been devoting most of his brainpower to getting laid, and with that out of the way, he gains a new thirst for knowledge and starts studying textbooks constantly. Eventually, he is able to do things like show up the Yankees by using his knowledge of physics to effortlessly hit multiple consecutive home runs, solve a Rubik's Cube while watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Jeopardy!</a></em> and getting all the answers correct, and become fluent in Portuguese <em>accidentally</em> just from hearing the cleaning woman at his job speak it. Which indicates that he normally puts a lot of effort towards getting laid. The episode shows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts">this is true for all men</a>, not just George, but it's probably safe to say he needs to put in more effort than the average man. In one episode, a woman decides to cheat on her husband with him simply because he told her "God bless you" when she sneezed, which her husband never does. When Elaine tries to apply this to her own life however, it's revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenAreLustful">the opposite is true for women</a> as the chaste Elaine becomes gradually dumber by the hour until she finally gets laid and recovers her slipping intelligence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchNemesis">Newman</a> has also been out with some very attractive women. Jerry learns this the hard way when he realizes he is dating one of Newman's exes. Although as horrifying as that revelation was, it still wasn't nearly as bad as learning that <em>he</em> broke up with <em>her</em> for <em>not being attractive enough</em>. The idea that this woman — or <em>any</em> woman, for that matter — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBeggarsWontChooseIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenBeggarsWontChooseIt">is somehow too ugly for who he considers being the most repulsive man on the face of the earth</a>, is too much for Jerry to handle, and he can no longer bring himself to kiss her.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jerry:</strong> All I could think of when I was looking at her face... was that <em><strong>Newman</strong></em> found this <em><strong>unacceptable!</strong></em>
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Elaine:</strong> Maybe there's <em>more</em> to Newman?

</div></li><li> Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> Kramer actually has the fewest number of romantic pairings of the four main characters by a large margin. He has 27 partners over the course of the show, compared to Elaine's 50, George's 62 and Jerry's 73, although that could've been a question of focus (Kramer does his own thing a lot), and in any case—as noted—George counts as well.
</li></ul></li><li> Nick Tortelli from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em> is probably the ur-example - causes Diane to swoon just by standing near her when she doubts his abilities. His ex-wife Carla has a similar power over men in spite of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">personality</a>. Though the women Nick seduces are considerably more attractive than the men Carla seduces.
</li><li> Tyrion Lannister from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> could be considered this, being a dwarf — something even more discriminated against in Westeros than real life — however, this is offset by his wealth, family prestige, his wit and intellect, and the fact that it's implied nearly every woman he sleeps with is a prostitute. He's only been in a serious relationship with a woman twice in his life, and both times it ended horribly. It's indicated he has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed">large genitals</a> too.

</li><li> Not just Tony; nearly all the mobsters in the show have beautiful wives and girlfriends, despite many of them being ugly, mean, or both. It's implied that the women they're with are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy">attracted to the power they represent</a>.

Alan is arguably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a>, since the women he attracts tend to be low-value (i.e. older women, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">gold diggers</a>, women who are emotionally/psychologically damaged, or just all around bitches). Lampshaded in one episode where he met an older woman on a dating site. Her words: "You're male, you're straight, and you've got a job."

He's unattractive, immature, obnoxious and dumb as a stone, but manages to hook up with an attractive neighbour, has a threeway with two cute girls while in high school (<em>and at the age of 16</em>, to be exact). He also had sex with a 24-year-old woman, after lying about his age. In season 10, he went out with a 36-year-old who had three kids, one of which was older than him. By that point, he was of age.

His waitresses are constantly hanging off him and he has virtually every woman in the cast at some point — and even gets a few guys chasing him. The exception is Resistance leader Michelle, who makes it clear she doesn't know what everyone sees in him (though she pretends otherwise to manipulate him into doing what she wants).
</li><li> Bobby and Tig from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em> go through women despite Bobby being fat and middle-aged and Tig being both abusive and downright psychotic. Tig is good-looking for a man his age, though, and he has bad-boy appeal.

Taken to an extreme in Season 5 when he seduces the hot wife of Detective Kavanaugh played by Forrest Whitaker, implying him to also be a Kavorka Man. So essentially Vic Mackey out-Kavorkas another Kavorka man. Impressive.
</li><li> Played for comedy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StellaUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StellaUS">Stella</a></em>, which has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> where the balding and bespectacled David Wain is irresistible to women.

This is really very good going in a series that seldom bothers to look at anyone's private lives (because most of them don't have private lives). This does just apply to the character rather than Chris Addison, the actor who plays him; Chris Addison is quite handsome and something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">Bishounen</a>.

Despite all of that, though, Eddie is a phenomenal lover, and his and Dorothy's relationship is purely physical.

Surprisingly, in the end, the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">take the trope apart</a>: Eddie explains that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">absolutely hates the fact that he can irresistibly turn on women</a>. He <em>knows</em> that they find him sexually appealing but otherwise a complete nobody, and any woman who's actually worth dating inevitably leaves him because they realize that sex alone isn't enough for a strong relationship.

He's lazy, uneducated, drinks like a fish, and (until a certain incident involving a winning lottery ticket and the front end of a Cadillac) a selfish, white trash criminal with no redeeming qualities. He is shown to have slept with many women over the course of the series. Ironically, Earl has very little luck with women after learning about karma and turning his life around, seeing it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">his comeuppance for being so horrible to women in the past</a>.
</li><li> Earl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatIdiot">Fat Idiot</a> brother Randy.

Two of them seemed to be in it for the kink factor.
</li><li> Flavor Flav of the hip-hop group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PublicEnemy">Public Enemy</a>, who starred in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1">VH1</a> reality show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlavorOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlavorOfLove">Flavor of Love</a></em>, where each season, twenty skanks (most of whom are almost half his age) fought over the affections of what must be the most unattractive man on the planet.
<ul><li> While it was a reality TV show, Flavor Flav is, by the accounts of his bandmates, a musical prodigy and actually a quite genial guy in real life, so he does have some appeal. The fact that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">millionaire</a> helps.
</li></ul></li><li> Pierce Hawthorne on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> has been divorced seven times. This means <em>seven different women agreed to marry him in the first place.</em>

</li><li> Film actor Leslie Phillips (see Film above) was given a new lease of life in the 1970s as the star of his own TV sitcom, <em>Casanova 1974</em>, which followed the upper-class cad through a string of increasingly improbable affairs with women of half his apparent age. Phillips played Kavorka roles until <em>well into his seventies</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>:
<ul><li> Quark in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> is a short, badly-dressed, sexist pig with humongous ears and scary-looking teeth, but he is usually seen with hot women over the course of the series. He's also an alien Ferengi, however, born into a culture where women are second-class citizens with no rights, so in that sense, he's not unusual. Working around humans and other alien races in which equality of the sexes is a given, however, does make him unusual. Most of the women he is seen with are attracted to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">wealth</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIsSexy">status</a> (and/or are on his payroll), but a few are genuinely attracted to him. Probably his most impressive feat was landing a <em>Klingon</em> mistress, Grilka. In a society that lauds physical strength and detests the cowardly Ferengi on principle, this is totally unheard of (although what attracted her is his courage and straight-up audacity, which are values in both cultures).
</li><li> There is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of the alien barfly, Morn, always being accompanied by a stunning woman. Supposedly he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVoiceless">a good conversationalist</a>.
</li><li> Another joke is Jadzia Dax shooting down any and all advances from Dr. Bashir, only to go out on a date with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGhost">Captain Boday</a>. One of these men is a handsome doctor with a British accent and (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">we are led to understand</a>) a long line of sexual conquests. The other has a see-through head. Being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a>, Dax has been around the block enough not to be bothered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreAlienBiology">Bizarre Alien Biology</a>. She did not, however, ever hook up with Morn; she claims it's because she considered him <em>out of her league</em>.
</li><li> Quark's brother Rom is another example: worse dresser than his brother, even worse teeth<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1dlhz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1dlhz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1dlhz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(interestingly, one episode shows that he had a very nice tooth sharpener as a child, while Quark had to use a stick. So by Ferengi standards, Quark may be the one with bad teeth)</span>, and lacking the rudimentary smarts his brother has — though he does have a knack for fixing things. By the end of the series, he's married Leeta, one of Quark's Bajoran Dabo girls who are definitely hired for their looks. In this case, it actually <em>was</em> frequently commented on, and even Rom was bewildered by his good luck; at one point he had himself half convinced that Leeta just wanted his money, so he donated it all to charity just to make sure.
</li></ul></li><li> Franz Bieberkopf in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BerlinAlexanderplatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BerlinAlexanderplatz">Berlin Alexanderplatz</a></em> had a string of beautiful women devoted to him despite being an overweight, unhandsome, unemployed ex-con.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeepShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PeepShow">Peep Show</a></em>
<ul><li> Jeremy. Despite his receding hairline, gap teeth, and a clingy, obsessed personality, Jez is consistently involved with many attractive women.
</li><li> To a lesser extent, Mark fits the trope too. While he has encounters with fewer women, he has even less sex appeal than Jeremy.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidCross">David Cross</a> plays a few of these in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrShow">Mr. Show</a></em> (and might be one in real life) as Ronnie Dobbs, Derwin in the Lifeboat sketch and possibly Lee in "Our Secret Love." The former is a lazy, white-trash, boorish celebrity who had his first wife Tammy, also ended up with a second wife played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennyMcCarthy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JennyMcCarthy">Jenny McCarthy</a> (and in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> has a girlfriend played by Nikki Cox). Terry's inexplicable attraction to Ronnie as well might also be part of this trope. The second had been in a relationship with both a woman and <em>her mother</em> simultaneously, and the latter had an affair with an <em>entire family.</em>
</li><li> Gibby from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em>. Even though he is chubby, socially awkward, and takes his shirt off at inappropriate moments, Tasha, who is extremely beautiful, thinks he's hot stuff. Lampshaded when Sam wonders aloud, "What is wrong with that chick?", referring to Tasha.

Lacey, being from Toronto, can't understand what the hell is so attractive about an overweight, balding gas station owner who eats his own weight in chili cheese dogs every day. She eventually comes to the conclusion that all of the <em>other</em> men in Dog River are so much more repulsive that Brent looks like the perfect man when compared to them. The other women pretend to agree with her, but as soon as she leaves they dismiss it as a load of crap. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sometime between the end of the series and the movie, Brent and Lacey end up dating anyway.</span>

<ul><li> Bulldog, who is short, bald, loud, sexist, racist, and highly obnoxious, yet still manages to score plenty. He seems to be unfazed by rejection, so it's possibly a numbers game for him. Roz has admitted to finding him attractive physically even though she's well aware of him being a pig, and has had several flings with him as a result.
</li><li> Despite being financially well off and a brilliant lawyer, Donnie is short, chubby, and not particularly attractive. During the course of the show, he dates Roz, nearly marries Daphne, and ends up with another very good-looking woman. It probably helps that he's ruthlessly good at his job and a genuine sweetheart to the women in his life (even his secretary).
</li><li> Daphne's brother Simon is rather homely in addition to being a sleazy, drunken layabout who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheThingThatWouldNotLeave">doesn't know when he's not welcome</a>.

Despite the fact that the "romance" in this game has so little substance, intricacy, or overall game consequence that the comprehensive guide only gives the marriage section two or three pages, the company that developed the game is (in)famous for favoring smoothness and balance of mechanics over logic and realism so much that the end results tend to have outrageous and often comic implications(the previous game allowed anyone with an alchemy table to craft a magic potion of fire resistance from two ordinary hunks of cheese). First, none of the potential partners were designed with specifically romance in mind; they seem to have been selected at random across the board from the already-existing characters, from contract-giving guild leaders to minor characters otherwise barley above background-level. Some are old, some young. Their personalities vary wildly. All the races turn up on this list. The entire roster is always available to you, regardless of your character's age, sex, or even of which race you picked, <em>two of which are anthropomorphic animals</em>.
<ul><li> In order to get the option to marry someone, you first need to do something that impresses them - whether this is fetching some firewood, killing ten bears, besting them at fisticuffs or <em>murdering their ex-lover</em> depends on the person.

His nice-guy personality no doubt plays a factor.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>:
<ul><li> Despite Cotton Hill's advanced age, looks, lack of shins, and extremely unpleasant personality, he still scores with various prostitutes and had at least three serious relationships. When Hank finds out he has a half-brother, he angrily asks how many women Cotton slept with, the answer Cotton gave him being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround">273</a>.
</li><li> Bill Dauterive is homely, fat, bald, has poor hygiene, zero self-confidence, and a stalker-like crush on Peggy Hill. Yet nearly every episode centered around Bill involves him getting involved with a smart, attractive, successful, kind-hearted woman who genuinely likes him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">He usually manages to mess it up by the end of the episode</a>.
</li><li> Dale Gribble is skinny-fat, pasty, balding, a chain-smoking drunk and a barely-sane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConspiracyTheorist">Conspiracy Theorist</a> who betrays everyone constantly. Yet he somehow married the beautiful blonde Nancy (who, to be fair, has been cheating on him for years with the handsome John Redcorn, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby">who is obviously the biological father of Joseph Gribble</a>, though she eventually broke things off with Redcorn after a romantic dinner rekindled her feelings for Dale) and also managed to attract a beautiful female exterminator (voiced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneaneGarofalo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneaneGarofalo">Janeane Garofalo</a>) and some groupies in the episode where he and Bill compete in hot dog-eating contests.
</li><li> Buck Strickland is old, fat, balding, and a general scumbag. But he pulls in an astounding amount of tail. Though as Buck himself explains: "I'm not much to look at, but I've got a lot of money!"
</li><li> Bobby Hill is a kid version of this. He's short, chubby, effeminate, and incredibly immature for his age, yet he has little trouble with the ladies and dates a number of very attractive girls, including Connie, due to his charisma and sense of humor. This is a total contrast to Joseph, who is very handsome <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">but is painfully awkward around women</a> and everyone else to be honest.
</li><li> Boomhauer is a downplayed, yet deconstructed example. He is actually a fairly handsome if skinny-fat (like Dale) man (and one episode mentions that he's missing a toe), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotorMouth">he talks so fast that he's damn-near incomprehensible to anyone he isn't friends with</a>, which makes his excellent skills with the ladies somewhat improbable. One episode reveals that his approach is to simply ask out every attractive woman he sees until one of them says yes, getting rejected 23 times in a row before one woman finally agrees to go out with him.
</li><li> Hank Hill himself could qualify as this. While not ugly, he's rather average-looking with a beer gut, has a foul temper, has difficulty showing emotion to anyone other than his dog or inanimate objects (such as his truck), is hopelessly devoted to his mundane job of selling propane and propane accessories and has horribly outdated views on life that many would find off-putting even in a conservative area like Texas. Yet he's not only married to Peggy, but has had a number of other women express attraction to him, including Buck Strickland's wife "Miz Liz" and mistress Debbie, and a few minor female characters (one of them being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairCop">Fair Cop</a>). Of course, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> man, he does not reciprocate the affections of the other women.
</li></ul></li><li> Principal Fakey on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em>.

The latter didn't seem to get anything out of her affair with him, which might be explained by this trope.
</li><li> Rick Sanchez from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em> is an elderly, nihilistic, amoral alcoholic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> but has been seen to score with quite a few women (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeOmnisexual">and men and a giraffe</a>). He mentions how in an alternative dimension where they halted the aging process, lots of attractive women wanted to have sex with him because they were fascinated to finally meet an old person. He also had a past relationship with a hivemind called Unity. He was also once married to the mother of his daughter, though the marriage failed.
</li><li> Shaggy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>: Homer is stupid, obnoxious, lazy, doesn't know how to raise children, and endangered everybody's lives multiple times. Yet Marge still finds him attractive and other women apparently too. (Although, by his own admission, he was rejected by most women before he met Marge, so much that he tries to give Lisa advice on how to tell a boy you aren't interested.) Specifically, the women who have shown him interest were Marge, a beautiful country singer whose career <em>was</em> kicked off by Homer, a nuclear plant employee who shared Homer's sedentary interests but still had a beautiful figure, Edna Krabappel, Lindsay Naegle and Cookie Kwan. When he was an opera singer, he gained tons of female fans, including one who became his manager just to stalk him. Homer has had tons of these throughout his adult life. That said, he has a very developed music ability, can be surprisingly clever when he bothers to turn on his brain and his loyalty to his family is, in the end, and despite his innumerable acts of neglect and abuse, unbreakable.
<ul><li> Downplayed with Moe Szyslak who isn't the handsomest of males in Springfield and has quite a number of abhorrent traits, and on the rare occasions he does manage to get lucky with the ladies, those probably won't last too long. In "Dumbbell Indemnity", Moe falls for Rene&amp;eacute and employs Homer to steal his car and abandon it on the train tracks in the hopes of capitalizing on the insurance money, which backfires when Homer goes to a drive-in movie and forgets to leave it on the tracks. Homer drives Moe's car into the water and gets arrested, with Moe refusing to bail him out. Later when he plots to help Homer break out of jail, she leaves him. In "Eeny Teeny Maya Moe", he meets the petite Maya, who is 3 feet tall. Just as he starts to propose, his insensitivity goes too far when he starts making jokes about her small size, and she leaves him. Moe's attempt to get corrective surgery to try and become smaller ends poorly for him, as she wants someone who can appreciate her beauty without altering his height. In "Pygmoelian", Moe gets plastic surgery after the Duff calendars put a series of Duff decals over his face. He decides to audition for the "It Never Ends" soap opera as Dr. Tad Winslow, being surrounded by attractive women. When Homer gets ahold of a script where Moe thinks his character is about to be killed off, Homer appears as an angel and blabs a year's worth of storyline spoilers on TV, and the producer explains that he was only going to be killed off in a dream sequence, and after getting fired, a piece of the studio set falls on his face, restoring it to its homely, abhorrent looks.

Popular with human teenage girls not because of his looks, but because the ladies always have a great, fun time when they're with him.
</li><li> Chode on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift">Tripping the Rift</a></em> sort of explains this trope by saying that only women's attractiveness is based on looks, and men's attractiveness is instead based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">how much money they have</a>. He explains this, of course, as he is happily counting a very large amount of money the crew had just received and adds "and right now I'm one attractive guy."
</li><li> Cal from the series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads">Undergrads</a></em> was made of this trope. Cal was able to effortlessly attract hordes of attractive college girls. Granted, Cal was somewhat handsome and good-natured — in sharp contrast to his rival Rocko, who couldn't get a date to save his life — but he <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergrads#Main_characters">frequently makes a slurping noise while talking or drools and often ends his sentences with the word "guy".<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Among other bad habits.
</li><li> Dr. Venture of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> - a skinny, bald, hunched, pale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> with enough neuroses to fill a few books - has managed to get a surprising amount of tail. Ironically, he has very little romantic luck when he's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">trying</a></em>; whenever he decides to hold off on the terrible pickup lines and cheap suits and opens up a little about his problems, he can be quite the charmer. To whit, Doctor Quym, Sally Impossible, Myra, Nikki Fictel, and Doctor Mrs. The Monarch have all shown varying (and sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">impressive</a>) degrees of interest.
</li><li> Peter Potamus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarveyBirdmanAttorneyAtLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarveyBirdmanAttorneyAtLaw">Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law</a></em> is literally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">purple hippo</a>, yet that doesn't stop him from often picking up human women.
</li><li> Unlike Butt-head who essentially always fails at attracting women, Beavis from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButthead">Beavis And Butthead</a></em> displays an uncanny ability to be this in episodes such as "Vidiots" and "Holy Cornholio," though in both instances the duo's stupidity keep him from "scoring."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a> is an overweight 50-something anthropomorphic horse who happens to be a washed-up sitcom actor and personality-wise is very cynical, irritable and unpleasant and yet one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">running gags</a> of the show is that he has a very active sex life. It's also made crystal clear that most of his partners were just looking for some consequence-free sex with a convenient warm body that they never have to talk to again, which he is famous for in-universe.
</li><li> The former member of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a></em> is a bald paunchy middle-aged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor">Bungling Inventor</a> with a fairly childish (though friendly) personality and an abiding love of cheese. But of the four shorts and a film that make up the series canon, three of them involve him picking up a new love interest.

She's portrayed as not being traditionally attractive and with a horrid attitude. Men have usually been repulsed by her throughtout the series, but in the final episode, nearly every male character she's encountered as confessed their love to her and wish to be married.
