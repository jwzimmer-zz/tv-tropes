When his true identity is revealed, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> grabs a random person off the street, forces Aya to use her Stand so he can swap faces and fingerprints with them, kills both of them (erasing them as well) and then just returns to his ordinary life as a new person, with only the son of the man he replaced suspecting him.</span>

Teranosuke is fused with a book and donated to a restricted section of the local library, where it's rumored that anyone who borrows it can hear a voice coming from the book. Since Morioh is already a town with plenty of weird occurrences (in no small part due to the sheer amount of Stand users living there,) nobody bats an eye at either of these.

</li><li> It turns out that many aliens live among humans and go about their daily lives; they either wear humanoid disguises or look human enough to pass. K also confirms that the stories found in cheap supermarket tabloids are often the MIB's primary source for information on invasions—no one bothers to take them seriously because they seem obviously fake.

Both U.S. Presidents and the rulers of England hide individual pieces of information inside the "resolute desks"—that is, a pair of enormous desks that are sitting in the middle of their private offices in the White House and Buckingham Palace, respectively. The current U.S. president conceals the titular Book of Secrets (a one-of-a-kind text that is passed from president to president) in a false shelf in the Library of Congress, using what would be the book's call number as the combination (which would be obvious to anyone who noticed the odd gap in the numbers on the books immediately surrounding that spot). But the biggest clue to the lost city, both literally and figuratively, is <em>Mount Rushmore</em>—as in, the gigantic monument in South Dakota that millions of people visit every year.

Unfortunately, Darth Vader is wise to see through that plan and goes after the Y-Wings.
</li><li> Stated in later material as the reason that Luke Skywalker is hidden on Tatooine, despite it having been the home of his father, Anakin Skywalker, who is now Darth Vader, in a Galactic Empire of thousands upon thousands of worlds. As it's explained, even if Anakin <em>did</em> think to look, he'd avoid Tatooine because he'd come to hate the dustball that had been his homeworld.

In West Virginia. Using their real identities and appearances, and not making any attempt to deny them when approached by the FBI. Smart.

</li></ul></li><li> There's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDicksonCarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnDicksonCarr">John Dickson Carr</a> story where a killer hides a glass knife by dropping it into a jug of water. This was referenced in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThreeInvestigators">Three Investigators</a></em> mystery where a glass statue is hidden in a swimming pool.

It's also referenced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryNiven">Larry Niven</a>'s "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatGoodIsAGlassDagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatGoodIsAGlassDagger">What Good Is a Glass Dagger?</a>", in which a wizard also points out (fatally) that wizards can use non-magical weapons as well as magical ones.
<ul><li> This might not work with water and glass, which have an index of refraction of 1.33 and 1.5 respectively, but it works excellently with glass and corn syrup, which apparently have the same refractive index.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> loved this trope and often lampshaded it. Some examples:
<ul><li> In <em>The ABC Murders</em>, the mastermind behind the titular crimes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is the brother of the "C" victim, with that particular death as his goal all along; he deliberately murdered three other people with matching initials to create the illusion of a nutty serial killer and thus disguise his motives</span>.
</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple">Miss Marple</a> Tells a Story", the culprit behind a murder turns out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a woman disguised as a chambermaid; Miss Marple herself points out that no one really notices maids so even eyewitnesses who saw the woman enter the victim's room wouldn't be able to provide an accurate description</span>.
</li><li> In "At the Bells and Motley", one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousMrQuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMysteriousMrQuin">Harley Quin</a> stories, a group of clever antique thieves disguise themselves as a married couple and furnish their new home with their spoils; when the husband mysteriously "vanishes", the distraught wife immediately sells the house, including the furniture, to an overseas buyer. No one questions her actions, because they're totally in line with those of a grieving widow.
</li><li> In "The Sign in the Sky", another Harley Quin story, the murderer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> insists on winding all the clocks in his mansion himself; on the day of the crime, he secretly places the clocks back an extra ten minutes, then goes about his day, thus creating an alibi for himself at the supposed time of the murder.</span>
</li><li> In "The Disappearance of Mr. Davenheim", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Poirot</a> short story, the titular character finds the perfect place to hide: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> in prison. He robbed his own safe to frame a visiting businessman for the theft and his own murder, disguised himself as a petty thief, and got himself arrested, thinking nobody would look for a missing man in prison.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndThenThereWereNone">And Then There Were None</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Justice Wargrave disguises himself as his own corpse, then secretly moves about the mansion when no one is watching, figuring that the dead are above suspicion</span>.

Who is the murderer? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>The man narrating the novel!</em></span>
</li><li> Dame Agatha used the trope a few times in <em>The Labours of Hercules</em>, a Hercule Poirot short story collection:
<ul><li> In "The Erymanthian Boar", Poirot is tasked with tracking down the dangerous mobster Marrascud at a Swiss chalet, and the case is seemingly solved when Marrascud's body turns up. But Poirot proves that the body is <em>not</em> Marrascud  rather, the mobster has disguised himself as a waiter at the chalet (who interacts with the guests daily), killed the actual waiter, and secretly arranged for a plastic surgeon to arrive at the same time to permanently disguise him.
</li><li> In "The Girdle of Hippolyta", a rare Reubens painting themed after Hercules meeting Hippolyta is swiped around the same time that a young girl named Winnie traveling to a finishing school in France via the Chunnel is kidnapped. Oddly, Winnie definitely boarded the train in England, but somehow vanished during the ride, and later turns up unharmed, but drugged. Poirot eventually realizes the two crimes are connected: one of the art thieves who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">looks about twelve</a> disguised herself as Winnie (who'd already been kidnapped at that point) and concealed the priceless Reubens under a shoddily-painted watercolor to be gifted to the headmistress of the school. The crooks knew that nothing was less likely to be searched than a girl's trunk, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearVillainVictory">would have gotten away with it</a> had it not been for the headmistress' policy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">reviewing her students' suitcases</a> upon arrival.
</li><li> In "The Apples of the Hesperides", a rich man tasks Poirot with finding a priceless golden goblet featuring a tree engraving, with emeralds as "apples". The goblet was purchased at auction but vanished before it could be delivered. Though Poirot engages his web of contacts all over the world to find the treasure, he eventually finds the goblet being used for daily masses by a small group of nuns in Northern Ireland. He realized that since the cup was so precious, it had to be hidden "where material values did not apply"; that, plus the fact that the thief who stole it from the auction house had a daughter who became a nun, pointed to a convent.

Building a whole new base from scratch without anybody noticing would've been much harder to pull off.

To film the event, they inserted their own memory cards into the store's demo cameras and started recording. Additionally, one of the few photographers to not get caught was the one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">holding her camera in her hands.</a>
</li><li> Some of the best <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching">Geocache<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> hiding places are right out in plain sight, though the cache itself will be concealed or disguised. Stealth on the part of the finder is of great importance in finding these. Some geocachers choose to wear a bright yellow reflective vest while searching in public places, making geomuggles think they're workers doing their legitimate work, thus applying this trope to geocachers as well as caches.
</li></ul><ul><li> Shakira once went to college, for a semester, in Canada. She registered using her middle name and wore plain clothes and little makeup. The famous pop star went quite unnoticed by all of the students at the school.
</li><li> Iconic Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway learned the best way to avoid being hassled by fans in public was to wear his own #7 jersey. After all, there would be no obvious reason for the real John Elway to ever do that.
</li><li> Britain's Ordnance Survey maps show many military barracks and training areas, because there is no reason for them not to, and for the utilitarian reason that walkers and casual visitors do not stray into live firing ranges. A military barracks near a city on the Welsh borders is clearly shown on the relevant map. You would need additional knowledge to be aware this is the home base of Britain's Special Forces. However, there are only open rolling fields on the map sections featuring the military research complex at Aldermaston, the American signals installation at Menwith Hill, and the GCHQ communications centre at Cheltenham. You could be standing on top of the massive radomes the Americans installed at Menwith, looking at your OS map, seeing only empty moorland on the map where the base should be.
</li><li> During World War II, MI-5 spymasters would have their coded messages delivered between units by Girl Guides because they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathSuspicion">Beneath Suspicion</a>. It worked, too.
</li><li> An anonymous individual on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit">Reddit</a> came up with the following trick: Can't remember your work computer's password without writing it down, but don't want some passer-by with nefarious intentions to get up to mischief with your login details while you're out of the room? Use part of an address, a telephone number or something similarly innocuous and write it down on a Post-It note.
</li><li> A similar trick involves using a fake name and fake phone number as a username and password, respectively, and adding them to your phone's contacts list. Even someone who thinks to check will have to fish it out of the list of actual contacts, and that's assuming they are able to bypass the phone's own locking measures.
</li><li> Lots of different species of plants and animals hide by blending into their surroundings using camouflage. They do this to catch unsuspecting prey or avoid predators.
</li><li> Black holes can do this too. They are only recognizable when there are light sources (or any electromagnetic waves' sources for the matter) close or beneath them, but in areas with little to no sources of light or when the black holes are comparatively small, they can be unnoticed.
</li><li> There's an abandoned building in the middle of Times Square in New York City, and no one pays any attention to it. One Times Square was originally constructed in 1904 to serve as the headquarters of <em>The New York Times</em>. They moved out only eight years later. The space sits abandoned, unnoticed because the building itself is now used for billboards and jumbotrons, as well as the New Year's ball dropping ceremony.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">The most successful serial killers tend to be amazingly talented at doing this.</a> If you're curious about this (and have a strong stomach), go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and watch a video of somebody like John Wayne Gacy or Jeffrey Dahmer being interviewed, and the most striking thing you'll notice about them is how dull and ordinary they seem, and how hard it would be to pick them out in a crowd.
</li><li> Research labs sometimes do this  there could be a lab that works on a highly dangerous virus in your city, located in an old building decorated with little fanfare, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">and you would never know.</a>
</li><li> The BT Telecoms tower in London was a state secret for decades after its construction in the 1960s. Officially it did not exist, despite being the tallest structure in London at the time, freely open to the public and including a <em>revolving restaurant</em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarilynMonroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> was able to do this by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClarkKenting">changing her gait.</a> She was once walking down the street with an interviewer. No one was noticing her, and the reporter was confused by this. She then said, "Want to see her?" She changed the way she walked and gestured, and suddenly people started noticing her.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzlehunt">Puzzlehunts,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or "metapuzzles", often work this way. Ostensibly, each individual puzzle — such as a maze, a cryptic crossword, a word search, or some other game — has a commonplace solution. However, the <em>true</em> goal of the puzzle is to find the "meta-answer", which is hidden somewhere within the solved puzzle itself: for instance, solvers might have to read diagonally down the crossword answers to notice another phrase, or read the first letter of the first answer, second letter of the second, and so on. Truly difficult puzzles can veer into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle">Moon Logic</a> territory — for instance, recognizing that the apparently decorative cars on a grid are actually symbols in Morse code— but the whole goal is that all of the information you need to find it is right in front of you. It's all a question of knowing how to look at it.
</li><li> Some Escape Games (real-life versions of similar online games) use these, often as the starting point of the room (most games basically follow a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinkedListClueMethodology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinkedListClueMethodology">Linked List Clue Methodology</a>, so you have to solve one puzzle to get information or a key that will lead you to the next one). For instance, there might be something written on the back of couch cushions, or the amount of cash in a seemingly innocuous wallet could be a code that unlocks a safe.
</li><li> In the context of abusers and people with abusive mindsets, this trope can very frequently rear its head in the form of covert red flags, hints as to their true nature that seem innocuous enough to a layperson to be cast out in the open without issue. People who <em>are</em> aware of what the abusers are actually like can recognize the red flags right away, but because everyone else around them doesn't know, they aren't able to catch onto the evidence right in front of their faces. Abusers sometimes use this to blame the laypeople for not noticing or accuse them of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BystanderSyndrome">Bystander Syndrome</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">rather than taking accountability for their own actions.</a>
<ul><li> British television presenter and serial pedophile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimmySavile">Jimmy Savile</a> was incredibly talented at doing this, to the point where his predilections were an open secret within British comedy circles but not much further out. In 2000, he even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasticConfession">said</a> on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HaveIGotNewsForYou">Have I Got News for You</a></em> that he was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtUuOIXLawg">"feared in every girls' school in this country"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the laughter of the audience (but noticeably <em>not</em> the panelists). Ian Hislop noted later, "It's a brilliant disguise: you dress up as a pedophile."
</li><li> Louis CK incorporated his sexual abuse predilections into his comedy for years, including an episode in one series about his character (also named Louis CK) forcing a woman to watch him masturbate, something he actually did to his female coworkers.
</li><li> Shortly after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KeepYourHandsOffEizouken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KeepYourHandsOffEizouken">Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</a></em> author Sumito Ōwara was discovered to be following photorealistic child porn artists on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Pixiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Pixiv">Pixiv</a>, an outing he expressed indifference towards rather than accepting accountability for, readers experienced in dealing with and combating pedophiles pointed out a number of bits in the manga that in hindsight read as references to such predilections, most prominently a prolonged scene taking place in a public bathhouse depicting the main trio of fourteen-year-old girls naked (albeit censored) and with older male patrons in the background. Ōwara, for reference, was 23 when the manga began. Other red flags include one character in the trio making an ogling-ish remark about the other's legs and said other girl bringing up the topic of the third one's panties out of nowhere, as well as Ōwara including covert sexual references in his own work on Pixiv outside of the series and liking &amp; retweeting sketchier artists on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Twitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebSite/Twitter">Twitter</a>. These revelations collectively threw early suspicions about the Pixiv incident being a fluke or a bout of naïvety into serious skepticism, and ended up casting a dark shadow over the content and implications of not only <em>Eizouken</em>, but Ōwara's portfolio as a whole.
</li></ul></li><li> During the Holocaust, writer Ida Cook helped Jews afford refugee status in Britain. At one point, this involved smuggling a diamond brooch out of Germany. Upon seeing how tacky the item in question looked, she just attached it to her cheap cardigan and let border guards assume that it was fake. She and her sister Louise would wind up repeating that trick many times, and then just acted offended if people <em>did</em> comment on the disparity between the clothes and expensive jewelry that they wore.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AndyKaufman">Andy Kaufman</a> and Cindy Williams of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaverneAndShirley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaverneAndShirley">Laverne &amp; Shirley</a></em> briefly dated, and she used to love riding around town in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">a beat-up old car that Bob Zmuda (Andy's producer) owned.</a> He bought it for fifty bucks on a whim and the car was in such poor shape it had literal holes worn in the chassis (Zmuda used to pass a handkerchief through it as a party trick). She loved it though because when they'd go out in public, no one would bother them, because they figured there was no way two famous TV actors would be driving around in a piece of junk like that.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlbertEinstein">Albert Einstein</a> found the perfect way to go out and about in public while at the height of his fame. He did nothing to change his distinctive appearance, but whenever someone would approach him, he'd simply say they were mistaken: "Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein!" By all accounts, this worked.
