</p><p>These countermeasures can vary from simple messages and reminders that constantly remind (and hopefully embarrass) the player about not playing by the game's intended rules, to more serious measures like denying access to certain features (bonus content, achievements, etc.) while cheats are in effect. In extreme cases, the game can permanently 'brand' the player's save file with some kind of designation to indicate the use of cheat codes (some games can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletionAsPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletionAsPunishment">erase their save file outright</a>).
</p><p>Of course, the game's own AI is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">never penalized</a> for cheating, because everybody knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">The Computer Is a Cheating Bastard</a>.

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation3">PlayStation 3</a> introduced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Trophies</a>. In games that allow cheat codes, using them will disable the ability to gain trophies on that particular playthrough, and will also mark said save game as Cheat. Same for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Xbox360">Xbox 360</a>, except with achievements.
</li><li> This dates back to electromechanical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pinball">pinball</a> machines with the famous "TILT" error message, indicating that the table had been, well, tilted at an unusual angle to influence the path of the ball; TILT causes all controls and targets to shut down until the current ball is removed from play. It has been referenced and parodied frequently throughout media, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>.
<ul><li> The first tilt was invented by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryWilliams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryWilliams">Harry Williams</a> and used in <em>Signal</em> to prevent players from lifting the cabinet to make the game easier. The original mechanism was a ball resting on top of a post inside a cup, mounted within the player's view. If the ball was shaken off during play, the score was considered invalid. It was changed to a metal pendulum and ring soon afterward to allow mounting inside the cabinet.
<ul><li> The "Tilt" name came when Williams overheard a spectator warning an aggressive player, "Watch out, you'll tilt the game!"
</li></ul></li><li> The tilt sensors actually have a certain amount of tolerance to avoid the error being triggered by the normal shakes and vibrations that occur during the machine's operation; skilled players can successfully "nudge" the machine, influencing the ball by a small degree (not enough to be considered cheating) without triggering a TILT. And since some pinball tables are very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a>, nudging may be almost necessary to achieve certain high scores. Some machines are even programmed to detect small tilts and may even warn a player they're getting a bit too rough before finally throwing the ball-ending TILT at them. PC pinball simulators frequently provide "nudge" commands that the player may use for a similar effect, but using it too frequently will trigger a TILT message, costing players the current ball.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Even earlier pinball tables were made of wood frames, and one method of cheating was to pound the underside of the cabinet; this was quickly discouraged by manufacturers <em>hammering nails through the bottom surface</em>. Ouch.
</li><li> A now-obsolete variant is the Slam Tilt, which would detect dishonest players trying to cheat the machine's coin mechanism into thinking a coin had been inserted when it actually hadn't, or trying to steal the coin box outright. Whereas a TILT would only cost you your current ball, a Slam Tilt results in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a> for <em>all</em> players <em>and</em> voids any credits in the machine (new games don't void credits in the game). However, modern pinball machines usually won't Slam Tilt, since modern coin mechanisms aren't vulnerable to the old exploits that Slam Tilt guards against and the slam tilt is not installed by default any more.
<ul><li> Slam Tilt can also trigger if the player is grossly violent with the machine, such as lifting it up and slamming it to the floor. No, the pinball machine is not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercussiveMaintenance">an Apple III computer</a>. And forget what the machine thinks, arcade owners dislike people damaging their very expensive equipment, and getting a Slam Tilt in any shape or form is a good way of getting yourself ejected from the establishment.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Pinball/SafeCracker">Safe Cracker</a></em> puts an interesting twist on this concept: since you can't lose your ball normally, tilting instead starts Sudden Death early. If you're already <em>in</em> Sudden Death, though, you lose your ball as normal.
</li><li> Some videogames are balanced around nudging, like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrueBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrueBall">Crüe Ball</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonPinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonPinball">Pokémon Pinball</a></em>  no matter how much you shake the (virtual) table, it won't tilt.
</li><li> Strangely inverted in French, where "going tilt" somehow mutated into anonomatopeia for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOfEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOfEnlightenment">Beam of Enlightenment</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Online multiplayer games, in general, have strict rules against cheats, exploits, and real-money trading (the practice of exchanging real-world money for in-game goods, and vice versa) that would upset the game's balance. Players caught cheating face punishment, up to an including banning and account termination.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>:
<ul><li> Whenever you enter a cheat code, you'll hear a voice shouting <em>"Yooouuu cheated!"</em>. The clip is taken from one of the characters in the final level who accuses Raz of cheating, regardless of whether or not you did so, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">all psychics are no-good cheaters</a>.
</li><li> Napoleon also does not permit cheating in Waterloo World. He tells Raz not to touch his pieces, his soldiers tell you that using telekinesis on them is cheating if you talk to them, and he won't accept victory if Raz tries jumping in the stronghold directly. Yet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypocriticalHumor">he jams the gate mechanism when you're about to win</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1942" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battlefield1942">Battlefield 1942</a></em>, you can enter cheatcodes through the console. If you enter it wrong, even by one letter, the console says "Trying to cheat? Shame on you. Feel my wrath." Such a result ends in an instant failure for your team. Even if you type it correctly, you are still reduced to about five death tickets instantly. However, once the round ends and you begin another one in the same match, the cheatcode still lies in effect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImpossibleCreatures">Impossible Creatures</a></em>, whenever a player uses a cheat, you hear a message saying, "Somebody's cheatin'!" and an icon appears on the left side of the screen for all players to see that says, "Player X has cheated".
<ul><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Relic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Relic">Relic</a> did it for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> as well, catching both cheats and modified ship files, as the game would allow things like adding capital-ship weapons to smaller vessels by editing game files. <em>Homeworld: Cataclysm</em> had <a class="urllink" href="http://shipyards.relicnews.com/bentusi/super_acolyte.htm">Bentusi Super Acolytes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowItIn">Thrown In</a>, essentially fighter craft with giant lasers, something frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">modded</a> in the first game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">because they're cool</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> If you win <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Turok">Turok</a> 3: Shadows of Oblivion</em> using cheats, at the end of the credits it will say something along the lines of "Congratulations, you won! But you also cheated... Try again?".
<ul><li> <em>Turok 2</em>, if you used the level skip to reach the final boss, would not allow you to see the ending movie. However using the all artifacts cheat and manually opening the door to the final level would.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Animal Crossing</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you turn off the game without saving, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze5MPltFz34">Mr. Resetti<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows up to lecture you once you turn it back on. Keep doing it, and his rants get progressively longer and angrier.
<ul><li> In <em>Wild World</em> and <em>City Folk</em>, this presents a disadvantage to those who pull off an emergency power off because they caught one of their visitors trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Griefer">grief</a> them by means of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">bricking seed</a>. (<em>New Leaf</em> allows you to safely deal with griefers by simply flipping the wireless switch on the 3DS; you'll get an error message and lose whatever happened during the online session, but the game will resume normally and Resetti won't lecture you.)
</li><li> He doesn't appear if you reset while in someone else's town, but you still get punished in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoGameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> version; your face turns into a Gyroid and all the items in your inventory disappear.
</li><li> The GameCube version allegedly has a custom crash handler (not the standard "On Error Freeze And Screech Incessantly" crash handler) to prevent players from getting a Resetti lecture if the game crashes. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen if your house suffers from a power outage or if you accidentally knock out the power cable. It hurts enough that you lost all of your progress. It hurt even more that you have to sit though that lecture afterwards.
</li><li> In <em>New Leaf</em>, Resetti shows up if you reset your game... but only once, and his rant trails off into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">lamenting how he was put out of a job since they closed the Reset Surveillance Center</a>. You get the option to build a new Reset Surveillance Center in town afterwards, but it's optional, and if you don't build it you can reset with no more than a mild scolding from your assistant Isabelle. Even if you do, Resetti opens his lecture by asking why you reset, and if you tell him you lost power or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">had no choice</a>", he'll skip the lecture and just ask you to be more careful in the future.
</li></ul></li><li> Also, if you use a Gameshark in the GameCube version, supposedly you will get a message from the wishing well saying there is "great sadness" in your town, and you'll never be able to get the golden axe. Of course, since you have a Gameshark, you can just cheat for it, but...
</li><li> The wishing well further punishes you by refusing to let you dump deliveries you don't care to finish. This means that if the recipient of the delivery should move away before you have a chance to give them their package, then you'll have no way of getting the package out of your inventory unless you reset in someone else's town. Of course, again, you can just cheat it out of your inventory. The well is <em>trying</em>, at least.
</li><li> You can also get punished for time traveling, that is, changing the time or date by large amounts. All your turnips will rot, and stalk market prices will plummet. Additionally, the game does not make a distinction between going forward and backward in time. If you change the system clock to three months <em>before</em> your last save, when you start up the game, the town will be in the same condition as if you hadn't played the game at all for three months. Since the <em>Animal Crossing</em> games rely on being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayEveryDay">played every day</a>, or as close to daily as you can manage, a three-month "gap" in time isn't very pretty. Your town will be full of weeds, most if not all of your flowers will have wilted and died, half of your villagers will have moved out, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltBasedGaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltBasedGaming">the remaining ones will wonder where you've been for the past 90 days</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Because pausing during gameplay or using a slow-motion function would invariably tip the game in the player's favor, if you pause in the middle of a level while playing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaRappaTheRapper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaRappaTheRapper">PaRappa the Rapper</a></em> or any of its derivatives, you have to start the level over.
</li><li> In the original version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em>, if you enter three or more secret codes that unlock levels (but not the ones you find in-game that increase your item capacities or transform you, or the ones that get you the Stop 'N Swop items), Grunty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletionAsPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeletionAsPunishment">erases your save file</a>, though Bottles warns you ahead of time. In the Xbox Live Arcade version, Grunty's Code Vengeance, as it's known, doesnt work for some reason, but entering <em>any</em> code not from Cheato will disable saving, achievements and leaderboards.
<ul><li> The XBLA version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoTooie">Banjo-Tooie</a></em> did the same thing with any cheats not obtained normally, even though there was no such penalty in the original version.
</li><li> What makes this even worse in <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> is that early on in the game, you have the opportunity to refuse Bottles' tutorial. If you then pester him in Spiral Mountain enough, he threatens to delete your save file. He doesn't go through with it. Players who've seen this may well assume that Grunty's similar threat is fake too...

<ul><li> If you use certain cheat codes to make the game easier, you receive the title "Cheating Chump". That said, using cheat codes to make the game <em>harder</em>, without using any to make the game easier, allows you to get higher percentages and better ratings, and cheat codes that don't impact the game's difficulty also don't impact your rating.
</li><li> Using the Warp Barrel in River Side Race automatically pushes your time to 10 minutes. If you want to beat Brash Bear's time, you'll have to do it the legit way.
</li></ul></li><li> Using any Gameshark code in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64">Donkey Kong 64</a></em> will cause DK to spasm uncontrollably throughout the game. Even in the opening. Also, your cartridge will be permanently damaged if you save, and your file will be permanently corrupted so that you die in one hit and cannot pick up items.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> routinely prevents you from get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">100% Completion</a> should you cheat, at least in the later games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em> onwards). (Although nobody's sure if that was a coding error or deliberately put there.)
<ul><li> The game gives you a "criminal ranking" - a numeric score and associated title. Cheating gives you a negative score, and a title like "Total Liar".
</li><li> If you activate the cheat that causes every NPC in the game to become an active combatant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">San Andreas</a></em>, the mission to prevent Madd Dogg's suicide becomes impossible and the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>. Quite harsh considering it happens in the final third of the game.
<ul><li> There's no way to disable the cheat once it's activated, so if you activate it and then save...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em>, cheats are entered via the cellphone. After you enter it, but before it's executed, it will provide a confirmation screen where it <em>explicitly</em> states that using the cheat would prevent the player from earning certain achievements (which it may also state). Your stats then include a "number of times cheated" measure.
</li><li> Interestingly, none of the pre-<em>GTA IV</em> games has a problem with you using the easier "abusing saves to keep your weapons" cheat.
</li><li> Also in <em>San Andreas</em>: In the middle of a certain mission where you're in a car chase being shot at, if you use a cheat which repairs your vehicle and makes it invulnerable to damage, the car blows up instead and you fail the mission.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRow">Saints Row</a></em> series prevents you from earning achievements and disables auto-saving should you enable cheats. It's not that much of a disincentive, since regular saving is still permitted and few of the cheats are really all that game-breaking to start with (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode">God Mode</a> is not a selectable cheat in part three, for instance, but you can buy legitimate upgrades to make you practically invincible anyway). Most cheats are there just to increase the wackiness and mayhem you can dish out, so it makes sense not to punish the player too harshly for wanting to mess around with them.
<ul><li> Using certain cheats for driving missions in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SaintsRowTheThird">Saints Row: The Third</a></em> seems to wildly screw with your partners' AI when they're controlling a vehicle and cause other glitches even if you're behind the wheel.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Warcraft II</em> had a ranking system to measure the capabilities of the player. Cheating players only got Cheater rank. Thankfully, there was a ridiculously easy way around this. It could only tell if you entered a code if you did so in your current session. So if you saved your game after completing all your objectives but before getting the mission completed screen, you could exit, reload, then see the rank that was due you.
</li><li> <em>Warcraft III</em> only displays "Cheat activated!" when a cheat is entered, but custom maps often change the message into highly insulting messages about the player's competence, maturity or genetic heritage, while others actively punish the player for using cheats by failing the map or making it unwinnable (since there's no way to actually stop the game engine from running them). Many even inform would-be players that the map is not optimized to work with cheats, so there's no point in complaining if the boss was killed during his intro cutscene and freezing the game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Angband">Angband</a></em> also recorded cheat attempts in the Hall of Fame.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization</a></em> games often have a cheat menu which the player can use at any time, but use of which instantly means that your high score gets recorded as "Cheat Mode".
<ul><li> Some (most likely unintentional) other drawbacks would sometimes occur as well. For example, one of the cheats had a side effect of also mass spawning roving barbarians near your city.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomeTotalWar">Rome: Total War</a></em> grants honorary titles to characters that perform feats of battle or governance in-game. Use cheat codes on a city and you might find it governed by Flavius "The Editor", an example of this trope.
</li><li> In several installments of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em>, performing a cheat code incorrectly would result in Lara Croft exploding. The cheat codes also varied slightly from game to game, to discourage you from attempting the older games' cheat codes in the sequels.
</li><li> Count the number of Super NES-and-later games by Konami that punish the player for even thinking about "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">up up down down left right left right B A</a>". The first example was probably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius III</a></em>; to make the code work there, you have to swap "left right" for "L-button R-button", and if you entered the older version, your ship would self-destruct.
<ul><li> Or, less well known, note that the ABXY buttons form a pseudo-D-pad, and <em>turn the controller upside down</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em> if you use a cheat to obtain the Gungnir, its description is "You shouldn't cheat!"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em>: In the Great Palace, bypassing the barrier early with the Fairy spell is instant death, regardless of how much life Link has remaining.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaLinksAwakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a></em>, it was possible to pick up an item from a store's shelf, run around the shopkeeper very quickly until he couldn't see you (he tries to face you all the time but can't always keep up) and then run out the door with it. Players thinking they had managed to cheat the game were very surprised when a) everyone started referring to them as "THIEF" instead of their chosen name in dialogue and b) they re-entered the shop and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShopliftAndDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShopliftAndDie">the shopkeeper killed them</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyFriendlyFirearms">with a laser</a>.
</li><li> In the <em>DX</em> version, though, you were actually required to steal from the shop to get one of the photos in the game. Most people chose to save this one for the end of the game when they didn't need to go into the shop again anyway. The DX version also has an exclusive dungeon designed for the Game Boy Color and it has its enemies and puzzles based on colors. Trying to get past the skeleton guards on a regular Game Boy will have them blocking the way and even if you do manage to get past them, trying to play through the colors gimmick without any actual color would be too frustrating to attempt.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Biggoron Sword</a> quest, there are several items that must be delivered to their recipients <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">within a time limit</a>. And you have to travel the old-fashioned way; you're allowed (and expected) to use Epona along with any regular shortcuts you know (like the ones in the Lost Woods), but if you try teleporting to your destination with an ocarina song, the time limit will be reduced to a few seconds when you arrive.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">Phantom Hourglass</a></em>, you can play a minigame where you dig for treasures. However, you are told to stop digging and leave the minigame area after you have obtained ten treasures. If you choose to ignore this and attempt to dig up an 11th treasure, you'll be given a warning. Attempting to dig up another one will result in a 100-Rupee fine, and yet another one will have all of your Rupees taken away. If you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShmuckBait">continue to dig for more treasure after you're broke</a>, you'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourIsDeath">banned</a> from the minigame. How do you get unbanned? By apologizing and paying a 300-Rupee reinitiation fee.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>, the store kept by a bird has this: you can just fill your lantern/bottle, but if you walk out, it yells at you and once you come back, it attacks you. Fortunately, you can stop him by putting even just one Rupee in the box (but then he calls you a cheapskate when you leave), and get on his good side again by putting in a rupee without buying anything.
<ul><li> Also, attempting to roll jump the ball over a close gap in the rollgoal game will make Hena accuse you for cheating and have to restart the stage.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkBetweenWorlds">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a></em>, trying to 'cheat' the racing mini game by using Irene's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBroomstick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBroomstick">Flying Broomstick</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">Warp Whistle</a> causes the guy at the finish line to disqualify you from the race for flying to the finish. However, the game does give you an in-game way to still 'cheat' the system, just warp to Lorule via the dimension crack placed right next to the start, teleport to Skull Woods in there (where the racing organisers can't see your actions) and exit back at Rosso's House via the second crack right next to the finish line.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>: Though you can use a single Compass item as many times as you like in Adventure Mode by opening the Home menu and quitting the game right after you use one but before the game is saved, it doesn't work with skill appraisals in the Smithy, since the game saves right after you pay the required number of Rupees.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaClassic">Zelda Classic</a></em> has a built-in cheat system where the quest designer can change them. Using those and saving in that quest will permanently denote that quest with a text that says "used cheats" when the player checks the time stats.

This includes using cheats that make the game harder, for some reason. Also, in the level-ending score card for Perfect Dark, the mission's status is "Cheated" and the agent's status is "Dishonored". (Contrast to "Mission Status: Complete, Agent: Active", "Mission Status: Failed, Agent: Deceased", "Mission Status: Aborted, Agent: Disavowed" and "Mission Status: Unknown, Agent: Missing", the possible statuses if you don't cheat.)
</li><li> In both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> games, inputting a single cheat code means all saves involving that character will have 'Cheats Used' superimposed over them in bright yellow letters. Glitch exploitation, however, is another matter entirely... and both games feature some VERY exploitable (and awesomely fun) glitches.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemeHospital" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThemeHospital">Theme Hospital</a></em>: The public address system voice would start talking about it when you entered a cheat code. "Hospital administrator is <em>cheating</em>".

</li><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPinballTable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DigitalPinballTable">Digital Pinball Table</a> made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZenStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ZenStudios">Zen Studios</a> comes with an operator's menu that the player may use between sessions to modify, among other things, the table's difficulty and gameplay features. However, if the player chooses to do away with the default factory settings, they won't be able to post high scores online.
</li><li> In one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">many fourth wall breakages</a>, during the torture rack sequence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em>, Revolver Ocelot warns his prey not to "even <em>think</em> about using auto-fire, or I'll know."

That would be awesome enough on its own, but he's not bluffing: Depending on the type of controller, it <em>might</em> go unnoticed, but if the game does detect it, it's an automatic Game Over since it won't let you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">input X to raise your Stamina</a>, and Snake dies of electrocution. There is no additional meta dialogue past that point.
<ul><li> In the PC version of <em>MGS</em>, activating the "Invincibility" cheat during the minigame only made it LOOK like your health wasn't decreasing, even though it not only continued to decrease, but did NOT accept button presses to recover the health. Oddly enough, auto-fire appears to work in the PC version.
</li><li> If one uses a cheat device to obtain the PSG1 sniper rifle before you encounter Sniper Wolf, said character will shoot Meryl instead of you when you first encounter her and it means Meryl will die since you can't kill Sniper Wolf fast enough to prevent Meryl dying.
</li><li> If you input '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">UUDDLRLRBA</a>' as your name on the terminal in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2SonsOfLiberty">Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</a></em>, the game mocks you. The only other time you can use the Konami Code is on your Ranking screen - where it performs no function other than to make Snake get annoyed at you for trying to cheat after the game is already over. Also, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw</a> sequence in Arsenal Gear, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">No Fourth Wall</a> insane rants is the Colonel accusing you of using a cheating device, regardless of whether you're actually doing that or not.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolidPortableOps">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</a></em>, you can unlock special characters (such as most of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3</a></em>) via in-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> achievements, or via inputting a password. If you unlock the characters via the password, they learn slower and the cap for how high their stats can improve is made lower.
</li></ul></li><li> In one mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceQuest">Space Quest</a> 6</em>, the player needs to go through a series of tasks to determine which file to search for information needed to beat the game, which happens to be the same each time. If you try to open the file without going through the motions, the game chastises you and takes away all your points... then relents and gives them back shortly afterward.
</li><li> In the original Sierra version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGloryII">Quest for Glory II</a></em>, using the cheat code for the first game ("razzle dazzle root beer") drops all your stats to the single digits. In AGD Interactive's remake, using the original <em>QFG2</em> cheat code ("suck blue frog") first gives you a warning, then lowers your stats AND disqualifies you from obtaining paladinhood.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CodenameIceman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CodenameIceman">Codename: ICEMAN</a></em> there is a sequence where you need to play a dice game with a crew member in order to win an object needed later in the game. If you save and restore more than twice during this sequence, the crewman will accuse you of cheating and leave the room, leaving the whole game in an unwinnable state.
</li><li> Entering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">Konami Code</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall">Super Monkey Ball Jr.</a></em> at the title screen will change the title to Super <em>Nice Try</em>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> series disables most of the cheats when you're playing on Nightmare mode. The only ones that work are "iddt" and "idclev".

<ul><li> And so does <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em>, where cheats are locked out on the two highest difficulty levels, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Nightmare and Trauma</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Heretic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Heretic">Heretic</a></em>, which used the same engine as <em>Doom</em>, punishes you for trying to use the <em>Doom</em> cheat codes. The God Mode cheat (iddqd) kills you immediately, while the cheat to give you every weapon (idkfa) takes away your weapons instead and leaves you with just the staff.
<ul><li> In the demo version of the sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hexen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hexen">Hexen</a></em>, typing in the first game's invincibility code (quicken) gives you a warning the first two times and then kills you immediately the third time.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Doom</em> mod <em>Aliens TC</em> replaces the "god mode" status bar face sprite with the admonishment "Cheat! Can't hack it eh? Loser".
</li><li> Similarly, in <em>Zombies TC</em> for <em>Doom</em>, the "god mode" face has your character sticking out his tongue and wearing a dunce cap saying "sucker".
</li></ul></li><li> Attempting to unlock Extra Savior songs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DanceDanceRevolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a></em> by using Cut and Freeze Arrow-off will be disqualified, preventing you from unlocking the song.
</li><li> Cheating in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a></em> would permanently reset the player's score to zero for the game and cause the score indicator to flash "CHEATER!" each time the player does something that should increase their score, such as destroying a robot or rescuing a hostage, while not actually increasing their score. Using the cheat codes from the previous game(s) in the sequels, <em>Descent II</em> and <em>Descent 3</em>, would set the player's shields to 1 (out of 200). <em>Descent 3</em> also has a "cheat" code that does 210 shield damage to the player (also out of 200, although the Magnum-AHT's extra 13% shield power means it will still have 17 shields if the code was entered when it has 200 shields).
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em> game for the SNES, if you use the infinite lives cheat code, every time you die, a picture of Aziz appears saying "You're lucky you're a cheat, Tasker!"
</li><li> If you use cheat codes to skip to the final level of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Battletoads">Battletoads</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover">and</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DoubleDragon">Double Dragon</a></em> and finish it, you'll get a message saying "Well done, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">even the Dark Queen doesn't cheat</a>. Try again without the warps." The Dark Queen herself chastises you in the original.
</li><li> In the Good Egg Galaxy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, there's an asteroid planet that can only be reached in the third mission. If you have a flying hack or something and go to that planet beforehand, the warp pipe that usually leads to a Power Star leads to a bottomless hole that kills you. An unorthodox method, but effective, as it sets up the illusion that this can happen often if you use hacks.
</li><li> Winning the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vectorman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vectorman">Vectorman</a></em> game after using any cheat code would make the game call you out on it, and tell you to try again without them, denying you of seeing the ending and credits. This was doubly important when a $25,000 grand prize for beating the game was the factor. You can cheat all you want in the sequel without penalty.
<div class="indent"> "Congratulations! Now play without cheating."
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Claw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Claw">Captain Claw</a></em> refuses to save your progress or let you use checkpoints while you have cheats on. You are still able to unlock new levels, though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a></em>, if you used the FUND code to get free money too often, a disaster would strike your city almost immediately after (though not immediately enough not to save, and the disaster would not happen after you reloaded). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a> 2000</em> also supported the FUND code, but instead of free money it gave you a loan... <em>at 25% interest</em>.
<ul><li> Due to a programming error though, the FUND code works even better in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SimCity">SimCity</a> 2000</em> than in the original. If you enter it often enough, the interest rate overflows and gives you <em>negative</em> interest — i.e. it <em>gives</em> you a lot of money every month, instead of <em>taking</em> it.
</li><li> Similarly, in the Windows 3.1 (floppy disk) version of <em>SimCity 2000</em>, "buddamus" was the code to get $500,000 and all of the buildings (including rewards). In the Windows 95 (CD) version, it caused a spontaneous nuclear meltdown.
</li><li> Typing "CASS" gave you $250, but using it too often caused a firestorm. Typing swear words such as "Darn" or "Heck" would cause all of your residential zones to turn into churches, which don't generate tax revenue.
</li><li> <em>SimCity 3000</em> had the cheat code "call cousin vinnie" where a screen message from a shady character would offer to donate a hefty chuck of change to you. If you refused the donation, you'd get a free reward of a really cool castle building.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Burning Monkey Solitaire</em>, games that use cheats get tagged so on the high score list. However, the real penalty is that the monkeys will see it, and mock you.
<div class="indent"> "He cheats! He cheats! The naked monkey cheats!"
</div><div class="indent"> "Don't worry, I won't tell anyone."
</div></li><li> Using "Undo" in the Solitaire game that came with the iMac caused the spectators to mock you. "So that's how you win - by CHEATING!"
</li><li> Most "rooted" as in "removed protection on system area" Android devices cannot play several games, in which the games did as a measure to deter cheating by changing, for instance, points and currencies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> A rather infamous one exists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>. If the player does things such as alter ivs, give illegal movesets or steals other trainers Pokémon (all of which are impossible without a cheating device) then a "Bad Egg" will often spawn (usually in place of that stolen mon). This thing is just a useless egg that when it hatches will cause your game to crash. It also occasionally duplicates itself, overwriting other Pokémon. Since it's an egg, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeofIndestructium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeofIndestructium">you can't get rid of it, and cheating to get rid of it often just made things worse.</a> Finally, anytime you restart with it spawned; especially after the aforementioned crash, you will often find your data corrupted and forced to restart.
</li><li> If you hacked to get your Mons' stats up in any way using the statbreaker glitch, your Pokémon will turn into Bad Eggs if you boot them up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonStadium">Pokémon Battle Revolution</a></em>. The same happens in <em>Revolution</em> if, during a transfer from a DS game, any sort of obviously-hacked Pokémon exists on the cartridge (hacks which don't look like hacks don't do this). They go away once the offending Pokémon has left the DS game and its stock is reuploaded.
</li><li> Later <em>Pokémon</em> games implement methods to keep players from either transferring severely hacked (as in modified stats and illegitimate Abilities) Pokémon between games or from using them in things like Colosseums and the Battle Frontier. They don't seem to have found a way to do this for illegitimate move sets yet, though.
</li><li> Many event hacks in Generation V won't work because of the Wondercard system; they have to be triggered by a flag in the data before they'll work. So, the 900 Liberty passes you get with the '900 of all items' Action Replay code are useless. Hacking event Pokémon usually does the same thing, since the game won't recognize them as the Pokémon they're supposed to be. Despite all Pokémon being released now, using a code to fill in your Pokedex will still block you from the Global Link in Generation V.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Pokémon X and Y</a></em>, any attempt to import a Pokémon with an unreleased ability into the game, will result in the ability defaulting back to the regular ability after bringing it into the game/hatching it.
</li><li> Pokémon Bank's side app, Poke Transporter, will not send over any Pokémon that fails its hack checks. Unfortunately, there were cases where legitimate event mons were seen as hacked.
</li><li> Anything created with Powersaves, the sixth gen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameShark">GameShark</a> device, will only be tradable if it's within legal parameters. This includes stats, moves, shininess, or unreleased Pokémon or items. Oddly enough, illegal movesets are not checked for, only illegal moves, and legality does not appear to be considered for all of the aforementioned factors at the same time, so a Shiny Pikachu that knows Fly, Surf, and Volt Tackle at the same time (which was flat-out impossible for the moveset until Gen VII, and is still flat-out impossible for a Shiny Pikachu as of writing) is considered tradable.
</li><li> Cheating is now also harder because patches can be released to update software and patch previously used exploits. In one case, players were induced to update their system and close the exploit that was allowing genning Pokémon via QR codes, because the update patch for the game itself was in the Eshop. In order to go online and get it, a system update was required. Not updating blocks any online play.
</li><li> It's impossible to transfer a Mew that was created with a glitch from the Virtual Console <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRedAndBlue">Generation 1 games</a> into Pokémon Bank, unless you go through <a class="urllink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/5q4meg/how_to_trick_pokebank_into_thinking_your_gen_1/">a really elaborate process<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a></em>, Game Sync allows Game Freak to detect things like unreleased items or the sole unreleased Pokémon, Marshadow, and players are getting banned from online events and battling for it. Also, Game Freak seems to be targeting giveaways on the GTS, banning players for trading too many Pokémon too fast. Sadly, a few innocents got caught up in the bans but couldn't get the problem fixed any sooner than the pre-determined ban length.
</li><li> This is the reason <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonDiamondAndPearl">Pokémon Diamond and Pearl</a></em> never got Oak's Letter or the Member Card released for the Shaymin and Darkrai events. Players were getting them all the time through tweaking and surf glitch, so Game Freak just gave out events by wi-fi instead. Also, getting Shaymin by the glitch methods doesn't trigger the fateful encounter flag, so you can't get the Gracidea flower to change its form.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonFireRedAndLeafGreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonFireRedAndLeafGreen">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen</a></em>, if you hack Mew or Deoxys into the game to skip having to need the events for them, since they don't get a special flag otherwise, they will disobey your every command.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonShuffle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonShuffle">Pokémon Shuffle</a> Mobile</em> will not allow you to access ranked events if your device is rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS).
</li><li> Attempt to use GPS spoofing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGo">Pokémon GO</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ki3f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ki3f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ki3f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">that is, trick the game into thinking you're somewhere you're not</span> and this will result in an hour-long ban—but this isn't a typical ban in that it will not lock you out of the game. Instead, you're denied access to pokestops and gyms, and wild Pokémon will always run away from you. This was later changed so that GPS spoofing will result in a proper, typical ban. (Rooted and jailbroken users are also denied access to the game, leading to the creation of patches to fix the problem.) Of course, players have figured out this can be bypassed by teleporting back home after engaging the Pokémon but before catching it. There were also cases of people using cars and public transportation to hatch eggs at a quick rate instead of actually walking to do it. Devs countered the exploit by disabling the tracker that counts your steps, which means eggs and any achievements/activities related to distance walked would be halted until you started walking again. Likewise, the tracker won't count your steps if all you're doing is walking in circles around your house; you actually have to walk a good distance for the game to count your steps.
</li><li> Most Pokemon games use the actual time on the system clock to determine certain events, like <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCs">NP Cs</a> who will help you once daily, items that respawn, weather in the Wild Area in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Pokémon Sword and Shield</a></em>, etc. If the games notice you changing the clock, they'll cancel all daily events for a while. (There's an exploit in <em>Sword and Shield</em> that partially prevents this though.)
</li></ul></li><li> Got caught cheating in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethack">Nethack</a></em>? Your character instantly dies, with the cause of death listed as 'trickery'. Time to make a new character.
</li><li> If you use codes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> to get dummied out items, skills, persona, or the ability to have the main character use his allies' personas, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mitsuru (or Fuuka)</a> would scold you for cheating. With full voice acting. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">We are not kidding</a>.
</li><li> Use the "Unlock Everything" cheat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a></em> and the save system disables itself.

</li><li> Using the Quickplay songs cheat (which vastly expands your song choices in quickplay mode) does NOT unlock Dream Theater's "Pull Me Under". You HAVE to clear career mode (solo or coop) to be able to play "Pull Me Under" in quickplay mode. Additionally, the two cheats that actually affect how the game is played (All-slide and Auto-Kick) are the only ones that disable high scores, money accumulation, and (where applicable) achievements. Everything else is fair game for use.

At 500 coins. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">However</a>, setting the clock <em>forward</em> is fair game.

Duh", while the final boss's voice taunts you, "I've been waiting a long time for this!". You are then teleported to a large room with no cover and exactly eight copies of the final boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chairman Draygan in his mech suit</span>, though there is a grenade launcher and some ammo to help you fight back. While it is possible to win the fight if you're fast enough, by running in circles and getting the bosses to shoot through each other, the game still gets the last laugh. The moment the last boss dies, the Silencer turns to face the screen, and then, if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> is not on your side, blows up in flaming chunks (otherwise the game just exits).

These states of altered reality included invincibility and infinite ammo. While these cheats were on, you gained zero honor points and were not allowed to advance to the next mission, as punishment for cheating. Switching off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeating">Over Heating</a> tracking via the same menu, however, merely caused you not to get any points.
<ul><li> Additionally, <em>Mech Warrior 2</em> used some of the original <em>Doom's</em> cheat codes for various effects. If you entered 'idkfa', which in Doom gave you all weapons and keys with full ammo, the screen turned white, the console returned "This ain't DOOM, Bub.", and your 'mech immediately exploded.
</li><li> In <em>Mech Warrior 3</em> and its Pirates Moon expansion, turning on any cheat would display a red "DISHONORABLE" above your mech's damage display, you wouldn't be able to progress in the campaign after completing the mission akin to <em>Mech Warrior 2</em>. Which presents some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a>, since in <em>3</em>, You aren't playing as a Clanner that fights for "Honor".

In <em>The Impossible Quiz 2</em>, this is accompanied by a screen that reads, "CHEATER! Tabbing is for TWATS!" with a screen showing a tab key getting X-ed out. Worse yet, one question attempts to trick you into pressing Tab with a message saying, "Press Tab 50 times!", complete with a timer. But the timer is actually a dud; if you wait long enough, the message changes to "Actually, don't do it, you'll die!" and you simply advance to the next question.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero">F-Zero</a></em> has, in at least one course, a massive shortcut you can take by hitting a jump pad at full speed and turning hard right to land on the track opposite of you - but a flying saucer will take your machine and drop it off where it's supposed to be, thereby negating your progress. In <em>F-Zero GX</em>, taking such a shortcut without some clever exploitation of the course's hidden checkpoints will cause your machine to simply explode.

</li><li> Most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CAVE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CAVE">CAVE</a>'s console ports automatically save state at the start of each level and allow you to restart the level from that save state, but doing so disables just about everything for the rest of your run, including saving replays, records, and achievements (in games that have them).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushihimeSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MushihimeSama">Mushihime Sama</a></em>, restarting a level also yields a slightly different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> screen that has the subtitle "Let's challenge without the restart."
</li><li> The iOS ports of <em>Mushihime-sama Futari</em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi">DoDonPachi</a> Dai-Ou-Jou</em> combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">Bribing Your Way to Victory</a>. You can pay extra money to unlock options that make the game easier, but you can't save or upload any scores you get while playing with any of those options active.

Unlocking him the hard way keeps him unlocked permanently, while using the cheat code causes Hibachi to be locked back up when you exit the game.

<ul><li> The "ILM" (holding down I, L, and M at the same time) cheat, which gave you full health, ammo, weapons, and keys, resets your score to zero and adds 10 minutes to your time (to prevent getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Speedrun">par time</a> bonus), the more difficult to activate debug mode cheats had no penalty at all. However, many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Wolfenstein 3D addons</a> change the engine code so that using debug mode resets your score to zero <em>permanently</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> When playing against the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.ludochess.com/jester_eng/jester_eng.html">Jester chess program<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, you are warned upfront that the computer opponent will cheat if you abuse the Undo Move option. The computer won't retaliate <em>every</em> time you use Undo Move (aside from a "Tsss!" displayed in the computer dialog box), but it's highly likely to do so when you try undoing a move that granted it a decisive advantage.
</li><li> A different chess program - the Kasparov Talking Chess Set, an electronic chessboard that mocked you incessantly as it beat the living shit out of you - included a Take Back Move option. If you use it, the game spits mockery at you in a sulky voice, usually "Cheater" or "Scared of a program?" at you in a sulky manner. If you then happen to win the game after taking back a move, it says "You win, but you took back moves. Maybe you'd like to try it again without cheating this time?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SubTerra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SubTerra">SubTerra</a></em> has numerous cheat codes, but using one to complete a level simply doesn't register on your progress or high score table. Except for the cheat that lets you play levels out of order.
</li><li> The debug menu in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em> can mostly be used without repercussions, but if you teleport to a certain set of coordinates, Lord British will appear, call you a "thieving scoundrel bastard" and sentence you to death by lightning bolt. Should you somehow survive, there's no point in continuing the game - all life has been wiped from the planet as though you cast the Armageddon spell, and all text in both the debug menu and every clickable object has been replaced with "Oink".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVIIPartII">Ultima VII Part II</a></em> has a few "cheat zones" which are really just extremely-well-hidden areas with lots of goodies, several of which contain chastising signs.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a>: Undercover</em> lets you unlock cars early by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">paying real money for them</a>, cheating in all but name. But for plot reasons, many story missions force you to use a specific, non-tuned car on par with what you "should" have at that point in the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DotHackR1Games">.Hack//Quarantine</a></em>, using a Gameshark to cheat in virus cores (avoiding the long dungeon slogs required to earn them legitimately), results in the game becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>, via a bug in one of the later boss fights.
</li><li> Entering the infinite time cheat in the old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ZXSpectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> game <em>Spindizzy</em> (not part of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dizzy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dizzy">Dizzy</a></em> series) would remove one of the jewels, rendering the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a> and basically relegating it to one giant explore-em-up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gruntz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gruntz">Gruntz</a></em> had an odd variation on this where cheat codes worked perfectly, but if you used any of them (except a select few), you could no longer save your game.
</li><li> One of the easiest ways to get through particularly difficult courtroom sections in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em> series is to take advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> to keep you "health bar" at comfortable levels. One section in the third game's second case, however, is deliberately set up to trip you up if you do that. You are only allowed to press one statement in the current testimony: a wrong press results in a game over. The problem? Every result starts with the <em>exact same line</em> from Godot, which is about all you think you need to see to know that you have to reset the game again.
<ul><li> The final case on the second game used a similar trick when presenting a decisive witness and piece of evidence: <em>every input</em> would net the first identical lines from the Judge and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edgeworth</span>, only to change if you got it right and kept reading.
</li><li> The very last evidence-presentation of the third game will, similarly, begin with the same lines, even going straight up to an close-up on your adversary before he waits for your rebuttal.
</li><li> In <em>Investigations 2</em>, a lot of the "presenting evidence" parts come out of nowhere when you least expect it leaving you no time to save and <em>Edgeworth himself</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">actually mentions how he despises people who cheat at things</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The amateur RMXP RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phylomortis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Phylomortis">Phylomortis</a>: Avante Guarde</em> would scramble the data on all your save files and boot you out of the game if you tried to cheat by editing any of the game's data files through the editor. Needless to say, the creator looked down on cheating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> had <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/The_Cleaner">The Cleaner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a level 73 demon whose only purpose is to show up and slaughter people who get help during certain quests that are supposed to be done alone.
<ul><li> There's also a third-party add-on known as High Roller, which supposedly lets you influence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomNumberGod">Random Number God</a> in your favor whenever you type /roll. Not surprisingly, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Rickroll">Rickrolls</a> you instead.
</li><li> Another early 3rd party add-on for the same game promised to permit you to be able to hack your own character, inflating its stats to incredibly high levels, permitting you to one-shot bosses and take on cities' worth of enemy players by yourself. Also not surprisingly, this turned out to be nothing more than a dressed-up 'keylogger', a program designed to record and steal password information, thus rendering the potential cheater's account forfeit in the most satisfying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicDeath">Karmic Bitchslap</a> manner.
</li><li> From back in <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, a mistake in restoring a hacked player's gear accidentally left him with a 'GM item', called Martin Fury. GMs are Game Moderators, Blizzard employees whose purpose is to... well, moderate the game. GM items are typically used for testing and some of them, as can be expected, boast ludicrous powers. Martin Fury in particular was a tabard - a vanity item that drapes over your armor - that had the On Use effect of killing any hostile mob within a certain range, instantly. The player in question handed this item over to his own Guild Master, 'Karatechop' who chose to use it. In a raid. Against a currently unbeaten boss, the Hard Mode of 'Flame Leviathan'. Thus giving his guild a Server First (possibly also world first) and immediately attracting GM attention. To make a long story short, Blizzard came down on the now notorious Karatechop like the hammer of Thor. <strong>The account of every single person in that raid was permabanned.</strong> Every single player in that guild who was even online at the time - even if they were <em>not in the raid</em> - had his account locked for a day. Some of those accounts may have later been restored but Karatechop himself was permabanned. <a class="urllink" href="http://wow.joystiq.com/2009/04/30/the-martin-fury-scandal-karatechop-reveals-all/">Story here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Blizzard has since changed the item, effectively ending possible future re-enactments of genesis. The new effect? <em>Use: The caster commits suicide, instantly killing themself.</em> When given forbidden fruit few can resist.
</li></ul></li><li> WoW also has the "No Man's Land" debuff, which shows up if you glitch or otherwise exploit your way into a not-yet-implemented zone, such as Hyjal. With the release of <em>Cataclysm</em>, the full opening of Azeroth, it is likely that this debuff will be retired, but it is still legendary; it would teleport players out of the zone! There are also rumors (albeit, unverified) that getting the debuff automatically reported you to a GM.
<ul><li> While it may not be "automatically reported", GMs do seem to notice players who manage to do this surprisingly quickly. If you're lucky, the GM may show up to have a chat with you and warn you you're not supposed to be there. If you're unlucky, you might get tempbanned.
</li></ul></li><li> The quest "An Inside Job" tasks players with sneaking into an Iron Horde base. Should the player attempt to bypass the dungeon with any of the flight toys or a flying mount, Khadgar teleports them back to the start.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Khadgar:</strong> Are you crazy, launching yourself into the air like that! Why not just send Gul'dan a telegram? Better yet, march into the compound at the head of a Brewfest oompah band. This is a stealth mission! Stealth!
</div></li><li> The classic text only adventure game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">Zork</a></em> would mock the player if they typed either of the two magic words from the earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ColossalCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ColossalCave">Colossal Cave</a> Adventure</em>. Xyzzy, one of the two words in question, has a long history of producing strange responses in games later than Colossal Cave Adventure—rarely (if ever) beneficial. Due to the frequency of the response, "Nothing happens," in such contexts, typing xyzzy in <em>Diablo II</em> produced no result whatsoever. Not even an error message.
</li><li> The RTS <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfNations">Rise of Nations</a></em> doesn't penalize you for cheating at a skirmish. If you ever cheat in the Conquer the World Risk-type mode, though, your faction will become known as "The Cheaters".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FreeSpace">Descent: FreeSpace</a></em> disallowed the player from advancing to the next mission if cheats were activated during the mission. However, either due to a bug or an undocumented function the infinite ammo cheat <em>remains activated</em> on subsequent missions. This allows the player to activate the cheats and choose to replay the mission with infinite missiles and primary weapons energy without having to activate cheats.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4zfyj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4zfyj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4zfyj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is (somewhat) balanced by the fact that the AI also gets the same cheat — there are two versions of the infinite ammo cheat, and the one that "remains" is the infinite ammo for ALL cheat. In fact if the player had activated the cheat, quit to the main menu, switched to a multiplayer profile and then hosted a multiplayer game ALL players who join will get unlimited ammo!</span>
<ul><li> <em>FreeSpace 2</em> had the same bug/feature with the infinite ammo cheat, but it also allowed the player to advance to the next mission even after activating any cheats at all.
</li><li> You'll get a message asking you to stop cheating upon reaching high-ranks on the first FreeSpace game. In the end, you'll get a message about you deserving the fact of becoming admiral and having to read boring books.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusEx">Deus Ex</a></em> saves have "-CHEATS ENABLED-" in big white letters superimposed on screenshots of save files that have cheats activated. However deactivating the cheats by reversing the state of the console command that enabled them will also get rid of the message.
<ul><li> Trying to save a game with an abundance of skill points crashes the game because of a buffer overflow. This was never fixed and probably intentionally.
</li></ul></li><li> Entering a cheat code in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupermanReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SupermanReturns">Superman Returns</a></em> for the 360 will earn you the "Not So Super" achievement, worth zero points, and will prevent you from getting any more achievements, either.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PanelDePon">Tetris Attack,</a></em> you can set an AI controller for either player in the options menu. The idea is to let a player enjoy vs. matches when they don't have another player around, but you can also use them in the single-player mode and beat the game easy with a high-level AI. However, instead of the ending, you'll get a <a class="urllink" href="http://twitter.com/SorachiJirachi/status/1190319537918533632">"Hey! Quit trying to cheat!"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> message.
<ul><li> This is pretty easily circumvented though because you get sent back to the main menu right after getting that message so you can disable the AI, go right back to single player mode, and immediately continue where the game left off, which would be right before the last fight (which it is depends on difficulty level). So, if you're feeling particularly lazy (or if you're having a hard time getting through the game on very hard difficulty and you REALLY want to see that ending) then this is a good way to do it anyways. Obviously though you still have to do the last fight yourself to get the ending so if you're not very good at the game then this isn't very helpful.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PunchOut">Super Punch-Out</a></em> supposedly prevented you from accessing the fourth and final circuit with a career/save file if you used a Game Genie or Pro Action Replay (not sure this still applies to modern emulators). Of course, you also had to not be defeated in the first three circuits as well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">which is likely why you were cheating in the first place...</a>
<ul><li> There <em>are</em> a few unofficial codes that will not trigger this glitch. Emulators won't remove the glitch, but they can make the game easier via reduced speed, save states, and rewind, which is plenty enough. And once you've unlocked the Special Circuit on cartridge or emulator, you can use as many codes as you want without fear. This is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a> than anything.
</li></ul></li><li> In newer console versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopNMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PopNMusic">pop'n music</a></em>, there are cheats that unlock hidden songs. Entering these cheats will disable score saving, and they wear off once you turn off the system.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSuffering">The Suffering</a></em>, you occasionally get random horror images flashing up on the screen complete with a mix of sounds; if you use any cheats, these flashes become a LOT more common.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WingCommander">Wing Commander</a></em> compilation "Kilrathi Saga" (1-3), the launcher program gives you the option of making yourself invincible, in the first two games, akin to the old "origin -k" command line switch, but changes your callsign to "CHEATER".
<ul><li> In <em>Privateer</em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack">addon</a> <em>Righteous Fire</em>, with invulnerability activated at any time during a mission, whether random or plot, you can't get credit for completing it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YumeNikki">Yume Nikki</a></em>'s useless minigame NASU, you can activate a cheat using a variation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">Konami Code</a> (← ← → → ↑ ↓ ↑ ↓) which replaces the playing character's head with an eggplant and makes 300 points eggplants appear more often. However, it also prevents you from saving your score.
</li><li> In <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</em> (and possibly other games in that series), using any cheat will result in your picture (next to your score) being stamped with the word "POSEUR". It doesn't appear to do anything else, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AncientDomainsOfMystery">Ancient Domains of Mystery</a></em> added a checksum in 0.9.9 Gamma 10; modifying the saved game causes enemies to become ridiculously powerful and causes you to lose your equipment periodically.

</li><li> The NES version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SolomonsKey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SolomonsKey">Solomon's Key</a></em> has warps to help you get to the end of the game — a good thing because there are no saves and no continues and the difficulty is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">punishing</a></em>. Of course, using even a single warp means you'll skip one of the levels with mandatory hidden objects, forcing you into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadEnding">Bad Ending</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZoneOfTheEnders">Zone of the Enders</a></em> has a cheat code that will give you maximum health and maximum ammo for every weapon in the game. It also sets you back a level every time you use it. You don't level very quickly in <em>Zone of the Enders</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em> does not appreciate the player entering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">Konami Code</a>.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Null Driver</a> gives you 99 stat points, which lets you level up all stats to their maximum and still have points left over, fills your ammo to all owned weapons to their max, can turn enemies into random scenery objects, and the ones that don't get transformed explode. It also switches sprites and background tiles with other random images from the game with every use, which makes it difficult to tell what's a platform and what's not. Still able to navigate your way through the level? Some important doors or key terminals to those doors may be sprite-swapped with something else that prevents them from being used, trapping you in the level. Lucky enough to avoid that (or smart enough to only use the thing once)? Your time for that level gets set to 59:99, so it's impossible to do a speed run using this weapon. The graphic-swapping effects also last until the game is closed, even if you load a different save file.

<ul><li> As of late April 2016, the VAC system has banned every single LMAOBOX user on Steam, including over 100 competitive players in UGC. LMAOBOX is the most notorious hack in TF2 because it was completely undetectable and allowed players to gain an immense unfair advantage over others without ever suffering consequences other than possibly a kick from the server. This changed when a user stumbled upon the source code of the hack and reported it to Valve. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A similar but less severe case happened with people who used a program to pretend that they were launching TF2 through Linux to get the Tux cosmetic item: it works but it changes your Steam profile name to "I cheated for a tux". You can change it back, but it will still be on your list of previous names.
<ul><li> However, it's also had a much more long-term and, more importantly, hard-hitting consequence: Tux is forever untradable. The earlier OSX equivalent to Tux, the Earbuds, were one of the most valuable items in the trading circuit. Since it can only be assumed that the main reason for said cheating is that a similar jump in value for Tux would surely follow, this assures that the cheaters walk away with little more than a worthless penguin.
</li></ul></li><li> The mildest form of this trope is that having cheats <em>enabled</em> but not yet used in the console, or even in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DVDCommentary">developer commentary</a> mode, prevents you from getting achievements.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6hm2m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6hm2m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6hm2m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">On the flip side, the game <em>does</em> warn you that accessing developer commentary disables achievements.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The official <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">Episode I: The Phantom Menace</a></em> game would only allow you to use each cheat a finite number of times. Once you hit the limit there was no way to use that particular cheat again without starting a new game file.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster">Tetris: The Grand Master</a></em> game will reject your record if you activate any codes prior to starting the game. Even codes that make the game <em>harder</em>, such as TGM1's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Upside-Down and Mono</a> modes.
</li><li> If you finish a level in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Blood">Blood</a></em> under the influence of cheats, a big "YOU CHEATED!" message will appear on the final stats screen.
</li><li> <em>Lotus Turbo Challenge 2</em> has a password that locks the timer at 10 seconds during the race. It doesn't punish you directly: it lets the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">score cap</a> punish the player instead by wrapping the score to zero.
</li><li> In some gamebooks you are at some point asked if you have a particular item that can't be obtained in the game (or something similar); should you go with that option, you'll be told off (or punished with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonstandardGameOver">Non-Standard Game Over</a>) for cheating.
<ul><li> One specific example were the <em>Zork</em> gamebooks published in 1983-1984, based on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Zork">computer game</a>. All four of the books had traps for cheaters involving a non-existent item, such as the Magic Sneakers from the Prince of Kaldorn in the first book <em>Zork: The Forces of Krill</em>. If you picked the choice to use them, you get punished by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Vindictus</a>, the Patron of Decision Novels, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">cast a spell on you as punishment</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> As implied by the above quote, pretty much every Konami game from the PS1 onward, except for the occasional shooter, has rapid fire disabled. Not that big a deal for a one-time task like in <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, but this made every incarnation of <em>International Track And Field</em> ever almost completely unplayable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>VI-VIII</em> had Obelisk Puzzles. Even if you knew the solution, the event producing the reward in question would not happen unless you really visited and read inscription on all obelisks. In some games the event was tied to a specific time happening only few times a year, meaning if you tried and failed you had to wait until next moment. Subverted because while this forces you to collect all pieces of the riddle, you still don't have to <em>solve</em> it yourself.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> 6</em> there is a gate which requires you find 6 passwords scattered over <strong>huge</strong> dungeon. They would work only if a person entering them had their corresponding scroll in their inventory, so simply looking them up in walkthrough wouldn't work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> 7</em>, it is particularly easy to abuse save states. They did, however, set it so you couldn't do that in The Arena. If you save in The Arena and reload, you get taken back to Harmondale. The best you can do is save right before entering The Arena and hope to get lucky with the random monster selection.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>: The Movie</em> for Amiga, activating cheat mode will flip the title screen upside down. If you beat the game the ending screen will also be upside down, making it hard to read.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em>Perfect Cherry Blossom</em> simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">closes itself</a> if you try to use a hacking program to modify your lives, bombs, or power.
</li><li> Most games feature a "Slow" column in replay and high score lists, showing the average amount of slowdown throughout the game. Ideally, the Slow percentage will stay at 0%, but sometimes, often due to the player's PC being overtaxed, the game may dip in speed, bumping the percentage up, so if the player tries to deliberately slow down their game, anyone checking their high score tables and replays will know. Many high score threads for <em>Touhou</em> games will reject runs where the Slow percentage exceeds a certain amount, often 10%.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Beggar's Canyon race of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron">Rogue Squadron</a></em> you'll be chastised and disqualified if you fly out of the canyon to take a shortcut. That said, and it's unknown if this is a bug or a feature, it <em>is</em> possible to cheat in this way if you're very quick about it and fly over the third dune as low as possible.
</li><li> In <em>Star Wars Rogue Squadron III</em>, when playing the Multiplayer Co-Op Mode, if you used the "Turn the second A-Wing into an awesome car" code you can't proceed because both players need to be in an A-Wing. Of course, there is also an "Unlock every mission" code, so yeah...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter Tri</a></em> players who are caught cheating face a ban from the game. Bans aren't permanent, though: they are set to expire...<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence">in the year 9999</a></em>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note78sob');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note78sob" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note78sob');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Players who attempt to circumvent this ban will receive an actually permanent ban.</span>

Of course, you can usually get to about level 2300 before this kicks in.
<ul><li> Using hacked weapons to put some of your stats up to the billion range doesn't cause the game to call you out on it however, but editing the characters causes cheksum errors in every game in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Flash game <em>Combat Instinct 3</em>, if you attempt to manipulate the game's playback, you'll get a "Nice Try!" message and your health will rapidly plummet.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead2">Left 4 Dead 2</a></em> punishes players who cheat in Survival mode. Several maps have exploits that let players be safe and zombies can never reach them. This causes the AI Director to pour Spitter acid on the group to coax them into getting back into the playing field. If the players somehow avoid this, the Director will then outright damage players continuously until they die. This doesn't always work since some exploit spots are considered "in the field" by the Director.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> prevents you from unlocking the three hidden characters of the single player campaigns if cheats have been used during the tournament. Naturally, this point is made moot once you use the cheat to unlock them anyway.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ConkersBadFurDay">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></em>, the cheat code entry screen has an imp who will make fun of you for using cheat codes ("You cheating bastard!").
<ul><li> Entering an incorrect code however, will result in the fire demon saying that someone must have told you the wrong cheat. Do it a second time.... "Didn't work the first time, ain't gonna work the second time. Dipshit".
</li></ul></li><li> If you cheat in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MasterOfOrion">Master of Orion</a> 2</em>, you can still win and the game will give you a score, but it won't go on the scoreboard and the final screen will say, "The Council has decided to strip you of your title in the hopes that you won't CHEAT next time!"
<ul><li> When you cheat in multiplayer mode, the game will also tell the other human players about it a few turns later.
</li></ul></li><li> Enabling cheats in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Section8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Section8">Section 8</a></em> disables saving your game, essentially making them entirely useless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaptorCallOfTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaptorCallOfTheShadows">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</a></em>, you could enable a cheat that allowed you to - with a single button-press - fully restore the health of your ship AND give you a Death Ray, one of the best weapons in the game. However, it also reset your score to 0, which in this game meant reducing the money you earned up 'till then to 0. The moral, according to the manual, is that "You can cheat death, but not taxes." However, you can use this code multiple times during a mission, racking up a <em>pile</em> of death-rays, and then sell them afterwards for a huge profit - then use that to buy all of the best weapons in the game and several Power Shields.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em>, the audio cue for entering a cheat code correctly is Jim yelling "Cheater!"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8k20y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8k20y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8k20y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the Genesis and Sega CD versions only </span>
<ul><li> Using the debug code to jump to a late-game level in the SNES version would take you there, but nine times out of ten, after completing the level you were sent back to <em>What the Heck?</em>

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLionKing">The Lion King</a></em> on Sega Genesis had a cheat menu with level select, but there was a problem; after completing whatever level you'd selected, you'd automatically be taken back to level two of the game, which, incidentally, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">the hardest level in the game.</a> Both this and the above <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> example seem to be a coding quirk rather than a deliberate example of punishing cheaters, since you're merely picking a replacement for level 1 and not your starting level (it's a debug mode).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraftII">StarCraft II</a></em> will disable your single player achievements temporarily just after you use a single cheat code.

Their explanation is that since the game is always online, using cheats to gain achievements in the single-player campaign would unfairly affect someone's online prestige. And, since the game is always online, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">banning a player's account prevents them from playing the single-player portion of the game as well</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>OpenTTD</em> has a nice little message when you open the cheats menu that "You will forever be marked for your actions!" and your name won't appear on the list of awesome people.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DestroyAllHumans">Destroy All Humans!</a></em> game had no penalty what-so-ever for cheating, though in the developer commentary unlocked by completing the game, the developers "<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">have no respect for you if you cheated.</a></em>" The sequels, except for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinOff">Big Willy Unleashed</a></em>, abolish the use of cheats completely, but cheats aren't really needed since the games became extremely easy.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jumper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jumper">Jumper</a> Two</em>, turning "modifications" on will prevent the player from earning gems or getting best times in a stage until they are turned back off.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog1">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> mod (found <a class="urllink" href="http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_1_@_SAGE_2010">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) gives you <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16VAMuR1Pc4">this screen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, normally limited to problems with the lock-on feature, when you try loading a savestate. It won't even go away when you try to reset the game.
</li><li> In the original <em>Warlords Battlecry</em> using cheats causes your hero to not earn any experience points at the end of the current level. This can be bypassed by saving, quitting to desktop and reloading just before winning the level as this deactivates all cheats.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KensLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KensLabyrinth">Ken's Labyrinth</a></em> has no love for cheaters. Upon level completion, it bellows "You cheated!" at you and gives a message at the top of the high score box, such as "Don't touch those cheat keys!". Worse still is what happens once you complete the episode you're on:
<ul><li> In Episode 1, it traps you in a cell with big flashing walls that say "GAME OVER" and bars that separate you from the actual map that the ending of Episode 1 happens on.
</li><li> In Episode 2, the final door of the level normally leads to the ending. If you've cheated, it instead leads to a series of five ten-cents-to-pass doors that open onto a hall made of walls that say "NEXT TIME DON'T CHEAT!"
</li><li> And in Episode 3, the game's last key door leads to a room with a holding cell for the game's bosses and the way back to Earth unless you're a cheater, in which case it leads to a room with no exit and bars enclosing walls that say, as before, "NEXT TIME DON'T CHEAT!"
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a> 2</em>, one level features two terminals that can only be reached by cheating. Their message? "Cheaters don't really win, and winners don't really cheat, Unless you're talking politics."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperAndTheThieviusRaccoonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooperAndTheThieviusRaccoonus">Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus</a></em>, if you input a Gameshark code to get infinite health, you will indeed get infinite health - but the Thievius Racoonus moves you get from bosses, which are essential to most of the platforming and/or sneaking sections, will only work with about 50 percent accuracy at best. So, sure, you'll have infinite health, but have fun falling off cliffs constantly or even failing at a SCRIPTED EVENT MOVE in the beginning of a boss fight (Mz. Ruby's mosquitoes), rendering the game basically unplayable without either massive amounts of patience or, y'know, turning the cheats off. The irony is that, looking back, the game is ridiculously easy, and there is really no reason to cheat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Strife">Strife</a></em> using cheat codes causes bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptBreaking">Script Breaking</a>. Warping to the last level prevents you from beating the game as the end boss is immune to all weapons the weapon cheat grants. Cheating to get the ultimate weapon early causes the rebel base to change location before you perform missions required to advance further.
</li><li> This trope is discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent">Questionable Content</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1571">here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

To get this permission, you need to do a quest. However, you can get the permission from other characters and show it to the guard protecting the dungeon. But if you do this, the guard will say that you are cheating and will take the permission from you. Now both characters can't enter the dungeon.

If you do this, the game warns you that if you activate it, your save will be permanently in Cheat Mode, and you will be unable to use the online leaderboards. Since the online servers were taken down, this is no big deal. What it <em>doesn't</em> tell you is that it also prevents you earning Trophies/Achievements.

</li><li> The second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpaceHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpaceHulk">Space Hulk</a></em> video game (Vengeance of the Blood Angels, the one that was on 3DO, PS1, and PC) <em>accidentally</em> did this on the third mission, where a couple of your squadmates fire through a door for an extended period of time and then follow you to the next section of the hulk. The exact amount of time varies because they stop firing when their weapon jams. One of the cheats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">prevents weapon jams</a>.

An enormous specter of the fallen god Dhuum appears and reaps the player, instantly kicking them off the game servers.
</li><li> If you use cheat codes to go to the final stage in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameGear">Game Gear</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaMasterSystem">Sega Master System</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a></em> and don't get the Chaos Emeralds, you will still get the bad ending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EccoTheDolphin">Ecco the Dolphin</a></em> has a menu that can be accessed by pausing while Ecco is facing you and entering the correct button sequence. There's a level select part of the menu, but the problem is, you would be taken just as often as not to a damaged or buggy version of a level. It's even possible to end up returning to the opening sequence with its auto-scrolling mechanics, but with the ability to control Ecco. Often, these glitchy levels were identifiable by the fact that only the level password appeared, no level title or description. Or, the game would simply return to the title screen and freeze there. All you could do was reset the game. In addition, if you use the debug menu (or even are just using an emulator on PC to play) to beat the second game in the series, the "secret password" message is replaced with something along the lines of 'try playing without cheat mode'.
</li><li> Adding scripts and mods to your installation of an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X-Universe</a></em> game, or activating the script editor in a save, results in that save gaining an unremovable ***modified*** tag. This tag means you can't upload your game stats to the Egosoft site's leaderboards or complete achievements. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/XRebirth">X Rebirth</a></em> did away with this, which was probably for the best because the game was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousBeta">nigh-unplayable without mods at release</a>.

</li><li> With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne">Max Payne</a></em>, Rockstar announced that cheaters in Max Payne 3's multiplayer will be forced to play in a specific playlist filled with nothing but other cheaters and have their leaderboard times/scores deleted/removed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter">TIE Fighter</a></em> featured a pair of toggles in the in-flight menu to turn on invulnerability and unlimited ammo if the player thought the mission was too difficult. However, turning either on for even a second would cause the player's final score to drop by 90%.
</li><li> For the mobile version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CandyCrushSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CandyCrushSaga">Candy Crush Saga</a></em>, there's a well-known cheat that lets you replenish your lives without having to wait by setting the system time of your mobile device a couple of hours ahead. However, if you do this and then let your lives run out, there's a chance that the time counter to your next life will be reset to an ungodly amount of time (like <em>tens of thousands</em> of minutes ungodly). The sad heart that shows up on the No Lives Left screen will even occasionally cry <em>black tears</em> if this happens.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em>, it is possible to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> to win against Gambler Daoshen in the Imperial City.

Even with extreme luck, winning isn't quite assured, and with low luck, winning is nearly impossible. Attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">abuse your savegames</a> to avoid losses will cause the game to automatically disable access to any gambling games for 60 seconds under the in-universe pretense of 'preventing cheating.' It isn't <em>insurmountable</em>, but it certainly is inconvenient, as a hand of cards or a spin of the wheel usually goes by in a fraction of that time. A fast player can get four to six rounds of blackjack (and about 1000 caps of potential profit) completed in that minute.

</li><li> There are third-party tools for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ingress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ingress">Ingress</a></em>. If you are caught using one (usually in the form of a large number of client-side requests), you'll most likely be demoted back to Level 1.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em> likes to play around with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerplexingPlurals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerplexingPlurals">Perplexing Plurals</a>; the plural of "kiwi" is "kiwus" for example, playing on the standard "-us" to "-i" pluralization convention. Certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupons</a> or other items that you can only ever legitimately have one of will often have a plural calling out the player on attempting to exploit the game — the plural form of the "Staff of Ed" is "Staves of Ed, you dirty exploiter you".
<ul><li> After some players used a glitch to obtain absurd amounts of in-game currency ("Meat"), the "Mr. Exploiter" item was offered by an NPC sales-penguin for 1 billion Meat—more than anyone could possibly get legitimately at the time. Players weren't punished for buying it, since it was only intended to drain the cheated Meat out of the economy (not everyone who had cheated Meat had performed the glitch themselves), but wearing an Exploiter puts "This person is the lowdown dirty bearer of a Mr. Exploiter" on your profile page.
</li><li> The "scratch n' sniff sword" and crossbow let you put up to 3 stickers on them to change their bonuses. If you do anything sneaky with your browser in an attempt to add more than 3 stickers, your character tries (and fails) to stick one on the "business end" of the weapon and gets a negative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusEffect">Status Effect</a> for their trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> The cheat menu for the PC game <em>Recoil</em> has a confirmation button that says "I'M A". Highlight it with the mouse before clicking on it to return to the game, and it changes to "LOSER".
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> has six clues leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FryingPanofDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FryingPanofDoom">Frying Pan</a>. This is a weak weapon, but can receive up to five augmentations, making it potentially one of the strongest weapon in the game. If you dig it up without finding all six clues, it deals zero damage and has no augmentation slots.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioKartDS">Mario Kart DS</a></em> has no major penalties for cheating. However, using any "Unlock all characters/vehicles" code via Action Replay will keep R.O.B., the game's final secret character, locked (This does not lock the player out from unlocking him naturally by completing either the Nitro or Retro GP's in Mirror, and even though R.O.B. isn't unlocked, his three vehicles become available). Secondly, any code that grants the maximum rank to a cup (three stars) will not retain when the game is turned off, even if the player does something to provoke the game to save.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a></em>, inputting a cheat code in name entry screen and confirming it will disqualify the player from getting feats on that file (unless it's a purely cosmetic code that doesn't affect the actual gameplay). Playing in Co-op mode or (prior to the <em>King of Cards</em> update) playing as a Custom Knight via amiibo will also disable feats.
</li><li> Cheating in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal">Portal</a></em>'s challenge mode will cause the results screen to display the word "CHEATED!" in big red letters, making that run null and void.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PonyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PonyIsland">Pony Island</a></em>, you get chastised by the game's creator for cheating and not playing his game the way he intended. Given that the creator is <em>Satan</em>, however, and that it's literally impossible to progress in the game <em>without</em> cheating, you won't be inclined to feel guilty.
</li><li> Downplayed in the text survival-porn RPG <em>Flexible Survival</em>. Using any of the game's various cheats lowers your score (and can send it into negative numbers), but the only thing having a high score gives you is a cheat code that grants you 200XP instantly at the start of the game (which will boost you to just a few points shy of 6th level). And given how easy it is to earn points in the game, it's not even really a significant penalty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheStanleyParable">The Stanley Parable</a></em>, attempting to activate cheats in the console sends you away into a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=teNsICR8JGY">Serious Room<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the Narrator gives you a lecture on cheating and locks you away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongerThanLifeSentence">for one hundred billion trillion years</a>.

However, this also means that once you have all your weapons at level 10 and Ratchet's health at the cap of 200, there are no penalties.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToneSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ToneSphere">Tone Sphere</a></em>, the "judgedelta" cheat allows you to change the size of the timing windows. Entering a positive value for the cheat to make the timing windows looser will disqualify any scores you get with it.
</li><li> In real life, electronic test administration software often come with an entire suite of anti-cheating counter-measures, from things as simple as logging mouse-movements and keystrokes to see if you are alt-tabbing to cheat-sheets, to completely disabling all functions on the computer that is not strictly related to the test (often by creating a window that takes up the entire screen, including the Start Menu on Windows <em>even if Always On Top is enabled</em>, and disabling moving or resizing the window), to using the webcam to check that you have not left your desk and tracking your eye movements to see if you are looking at cheating materials (useful for tests that are taken at home, not at supervised testing facilities).

However, this only happens if you do it in front of them. If you're behind them (the Penguin) or very far in front (Koopa the Quick), you can cheat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyPlanetRobobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyPlanetRobobot">Kirby: Planet Robobot</a></em>, using amiibo in the Arena, True Arena and Meta Knightmare Returns modes will label your record with the amiibo icon to show that you used them.

It will also be blocked out when a girl lets you ask her something about herself (likely to make it more difficult to ask her something you haven't yet).
</li><li> <em>Treasure Master</em> was a game developed for a contest that gave you a chance to win real money and prizes, so attempting to play it through a Game Genie would cause the game to refuse to load.

It's the only thing in the game that deals pure damage (so shields and armour won't help), and it's even the only thing that is immune to Bard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">Tempered Fate</a> ability, which affects even things like turrets and Baron Nashor. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrappyMechanic">The dodge stat</a> allowed the user to mitigate this damage, which is part of why it was removed.

Of course, with the proper cheats, you can bypass this... until you absolutely need a blue shell to progress further.
</li><li> Freeware <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> fangame <em>Sonic Gather Battle</em> quickly gained infamy for having a ludicrously invasive anti-cheat DRM. This includes invading your computer to steal information such as your IP address to upload to a cloud server, changing files in your OS' registry, and force-closing your internet browser if you even so much as type "cheat" or "hack" into it. It's so bad, that the game is considered by many to be malware disguised as a game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RhythmHeaven">Rhythm Heaven</a></em>: In <em>Megamix</em>'s Final Remix, if you try to cheese your way through the "Clap Trap" segment by repeatedly tapping/pressing A, the game will penalize you by locking out your inputs for the duration of the "Jungle Gymnast" and "Karate Man Senior" segments.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBrosX">Super Mario Bros. X</a></em>, using any of the various cheat codes that give you items, lives, or other things such as free map movement will disable saving. Unless you type "redigitiscool" while on the map screen, which will let you save again.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TetrisTheGrandMaster">Tetris: The Grand Master</a></em> clone <em>Heboris</em>, if you are playing a mode or mission where the objective is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldTheLine">surviving for a set amount of time</a>, and you use a rotation system that lets you keep blocks from locking into place for an extended period of time, the timer will stop and the game will tell you to "PUT THE BLOCK!" until you actually lock it in place to let the timer resume.
</li><li> <em>Bloons TD Battles</em> has no mercy if you cheat, especially if you're on mobile or Steam. If the mobile version detects you have been using cheats to get tons of medallions, earn a lot of battle energy, or if you play the game on a jailbroken device, then the game will look normal, but you are actually sent into a hacker pool where you can only play against other hackers in the hacker pool and won't be able to earn medallion rewards from weekly leaderboards or be able to join clans. Both versions (flash and mobile) also detects hacks throughout the game and instantly disconnects you if you use a hack to place towers or upgrade towers for free.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlugDefense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlugDefense">Metal Slug Defense</a></em> and it's sequel, using any explicit tools that allows to cheat the game such as increasing the number of medals and sorties, the development team will make your account get suspended and cannot be recovered again once if you get caught doing this behavior which can be found in the rules.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fortnite">Fortnite</a> Battle Royale</em> has Playgrounds mode, a limited-time mode where you and an optional squad can explore and build on the island without the hassle of other players trying to kill you. However, it doesn't let you gain XP or complete challenges.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quadrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quadrax">Quadrax</a></em> had set passwords for each level which obviously could be shared between different players. To prevent this, <em>Quadrax III</em> to <em>V</em> (made by different developer) had randomized passwords between installations (later installments would use account system instead). However, that's not the end of it: the game actually verifies if the previous level was effectively finished, otherwise even correct password wouldn't work, so anyone trying to brute force their way will just waste their time.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Nintendo Wars</a></em> series has these two rules: if you move a unit you can press B to undo the move if you haven't chosen an action for that unit yet (like, Fire, Wait, Capture, etc), and if a unit bumps into a hidden enemy along their path during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a> they are "ambushed" and immediately end their turn on the spot without being able to act. This means you can "scout" by continually choosing different moves and cancelling to see if paths are clear with one unit, then cruise another through a path you unfairly know is clear. To discourage this, the devs set it so during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FogOfWar">Fog of War</a> a cancelled move still burns fuel<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10sdxp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10sdxp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10sdxp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Moving five squares normally burns five fuel, but moving five squares, undoing the move, and moving five squares in a different direction will burn ten fuel instead</span>. The game also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">neglects to tell you this</a>, meaning most players find this out the hard way after thinking they'd found a clever way to game the system only to realize their units are burning a ton of fuel <em>Advance Wars: Days of Ruin</em> prevents scouting by making it so that the unit doesn't actually move until you confirm the action taken.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AntiIdleTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AntiIdleTheGame">Anti-Idle: The Game</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Ultimate Avoidance, if you move your cursor outside of the game window, it's an automatic Game Over.
</li><li> The exhaustion mechanic in Battle Arena, where holding down a key as an alternative for idling will have consequences. Holding down the key for 10 minutes causes your damage to take a nosedive, and holding it for another 10 minutes kills you.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWare">WarioWare</a></em> games do allow you to pause when playing, but the screens will turn black during the microgame if you pause there since you could cheat if the display wasn't covered up when paused.
</li><li> Within an instanced dungeon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PerfectWorld">Perfect World</a></em> called Dawnlight Halls, getting the "dice" middle path will have the player party fighting a gambling-loving succubus named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuzzleBoss">Kailia the Otherworldly</a> at the end of the path. Kailia loves punishing the player party for all failures to roll the correct number on the puzzle die in her arena by inflicting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuffDispel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuffDispel">Status-Buff Dispel</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CooldownManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CooldownManipulation">Cooldown Manipulation</a> debuff that CANNOT be dispelled (and as it lasts as long as two minutes, waiting it out is not a viable strategy either). If you didn't time your use of an invulnerability potion just right to prevent being afflicted (not considered cheating, as immunity potions have cooldown timers to prevent their abuse), then you will need to "sacrifice" FIVE of your skills by using them, with the understanding that the debuff will prevent you from using any of the sacrificed skills again for up to two full minutes. Thus if you're NOT playing either the main tank or the main healer, you'll probably get the idea to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">flee the battlefield</a> and come back after Kailia has cast her debuff-and-purge. Deicide and Judgment modes, however, make escaping in a cowardly fashion an EXTREMELY risky tactic, as Kailia will constantly launch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPolykill">One-Hit Polykill</a> strikes covering a quadrant of the battlefield, entirely unrelated to aggro (moving clockwise in Deicide, moving randomly in Judgment). If you're in the hallway leading from the dice-game board to the battlefield when her death-quadrant strikes one of the two front quarters of the battlefield, Kailia WILL strike you dead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">even if you're on the apparent "safe" side of the hallway</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a> 2</em> on PS2 has, hands down, the most vicious anti-cheat ever. You decide to make two saves before you start cheating, just in case. You then fire up your cheat device. And suddenly find that after a couple battles, the game crashes on battle entry. Bad cheat code, right? Boot without cheating, load the save file. It still crashes. Oh well something bad must have saved. Good thing you made that backup. You load the backup save, without cheats. It crashes too now, at the exact same spot. When the game catches you cheating, it infects the system save of the game. If any infected save is read, the infection that causes battle crashes spreads to other saves it can find. Your backup "just in case I got caught cheating" save has become worthless. You have to delete all infected saves (and since you can't tell what's infected that means every save from the game on the card) and start completely over without cheating. Don't even think of trying to switch memory cards. Delete all infected VP2 saves, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars. Failing to do so will risk it spreading to your clean saves. Heaven help you if you failed to remove your little brother's infected memory card before booting the game, as now your saves are likely to crash too. Or failed to hard reboot before putting your card in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CusterdsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CusterdsQuest">Custerd's Quest</a></em>: Type in "Cheat" and the game responds with "CHEAT MODE ERROR! PROGRAM CORRUPTED!" and boots you out.
</li><li> Certain titles in the <em>City Building</em> series of games created by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImpressionsGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ImpressionsGames">Impressions Games</a> and Creator/Activision will reduce your mission score to 0 with the note "CHEATED - no score" if you use cheats meant to aid your game performance. Using the purely aesthetic ones will have no effect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManDrWilysRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManDrWilysRevenge">Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge</a></em>, if you think about using a cheat that unlocks all weapons, they will deal no damage to most of the bosses. For example, using Atomic Fire on a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan1">Mega Man</a></em> boss.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> has a few anti cheat measures put in place if players get clever and try to circumvent the rules:
<ul><li> In every trial and raid, a boss will have a "do the mechanic or my follow up attack will cause a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyWipe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyWipe">Total Party Wipe</a>". Some bosses have a backup where if the players somehow manage to bypass the instant kill attack for failing a mechanic, the boss will spam their attacks until the survivors die. In the event that players manage to exploit a boss due to their AI breaking, they run the risk of having their accounts suspended or even outright banned since abusing exploits is against the terms of service.
</li><li> The 2nd boss of The Copied Factory raid has all three alliances on separate platforms with mechanics that each alliance has to deal with on their own. If an alliance revives a fallen player from a different alliance, that player will be placed with the alliance that revived them. In order to prevent players from purposely killing themselves so that they don't have to do their own mechanics, the boss will transport misplaced players back to their own platform.
</li></ul></li><li> The Desert Bus game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PennAndTellersSmokeAndMirrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PennAndTellersSmokeAndMirrors">Penn and Teller's Smoke and Mirrors</a></em> requires several real life hours of play of driving the bus from Tucson Arizona to Las Vegas Nevada. Players trying to one up the game will usually place a heavy object on the acceleration button so the bus drives itself, only to find out that the bus occasionally drifts to the right so that the player is actually playing by keeping the bus straight. Letting the bus drift off the road makes it stall out and then a tow truck takes it back to the start with the same amount of time spent driving.
</li><li> <em>The Longing</em> requires the player to wait 400 days for the main ending, with various events happening over the course of days, weeks, or months. Players using cheat engines to accelerate the game clock are teleported to a single room prison where they are chained to a massive ball and told to click a button 400 times to repent. Once this is done, the game tells them to return the game clock to normal or get sent back to the prison again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Progressbar95" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Progressbar95">Progressbar 95</a></em>: Double subverted. The game does not complain if you use cheats, but you can delete their cheats.txt file in ProgressDOS to get the Fair Play bonus. If you don't use them or are playing on an easier difficulty, it's likely the better option.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KittensGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KittensGame">Kittens Game</a></em> players detected using an autoclicker<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11nu6c');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11nu6c" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11nu6c');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Clicking "Gather Catnip" 2,500 consecutive times without 2.5 seconds ever passing between clicks</span> will find themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementMockery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementMockery">"awarded" with the achievement</a> "Super Unethical Climax".

If the player uses cheats to unlock the Speer Plan focus, a <a class="urllink" href="https://i.redd.it/qck82daw9oc51.png">special event<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> has Speer try to introduce his plans to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">work with the USA against Japan</a>... only for Hitler to storm out of his room (still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingPyjamas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmbarrassingPyjamas">wearing his nightgown</a>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">screaming about the player cheating</a>, chewing them out for using console commands when HE conquered all of Europe without them, before telling them to restart the whole game, and play FAIRLY this time. Speer, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceWhatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceWhatAudience">completely baffled as to what Hitler is screaming about</a>, decides to restart the heating system, hoping that Hitler's mental breakdown was just a lapse in the air conditioning.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infinite1Ups" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Infinite1Ups">Infinite 1-Ups</a> trick is more intentionally parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPaperMario">Super Paper Mario</a></em>, where attempting it will actually cause your score to <em>drop.</em>

The password contains a checksum that not only makes it more difficult to change your stats or stage just by changing one character (although there are walkthroughs that have cracked this checksum), but it also imposes a minimum starting stage based on your ship's stat sum, so you can't just, say, go into stage 2 with a maxed-out ship.
