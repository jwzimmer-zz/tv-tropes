</p><p>The literary term for this is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartia">hamartia,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a Greek term from Aristotle's <em>Poetics</em> (and an admittedly vaguely-defined one—it can also be interpreted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a>).

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AccelWorld">Accel World</a></em> Kuroyukihime, also known as Black Lotus, has two major ones. The first is the decision to kill Red Rider, spurred on by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her sister lying about Red Rider plotting to put the other kings at his mercy through the nonaggression pact</span>, which leads to her being labeled the worst criminal in Brain Burst, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being kicked out of her house when she confronts her sister with a box cutter in the real world</span>. The second is the decision to raid the Imperial Palace with the Elements, a team of four high-level players with special abilities <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTailoredToTheParty">intended to counter</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourGods">The Four Gods</a> (who must be engaged simultaneously, lest they recover health too quickly). The mission ends in failure, with Black Lotus and Sky Raker barely escaping, and with the other three Elements being trapped in a situation in which the enemy will kill them repeatedly if they log on, thus leading to the old Nega Nebulus breaking up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: The irreversible choice that leads to Griffith's downfall and brings all of the Hawks down with him is his tryst with Princess Charlotte immediately after Guts leaves the Band of the Hawk. From this follows his arrest and torture, the outlawing and near annihilation of the Band of the Hawk, and the whole chain of events leading up to the Eclipse—by which time Griffith has hit the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> and is persuaded to sacrifice the lives and souls of all of his followers in order to ascend to demonic godhood. The cause of this mistake was that Griffith couldn't reconcile his ambition with his human emotions—he grew to care about Guts as more than a mere pawn, but couldn't admit his feelings to Guts or himself, nor abide not being able to control Guts's destiny. That created a void that he impulsively tried to fill with sexual conquest and control over someone else. This is just the biggest mistake in the Golden Age Arc, since Guts and Casca might be said to have made crucial mistakes of their own which contributed to that ending:
<ul><li> Guts himself knows all too well that leaving the Band of the Hawk was the biggest mistake he ever made, since the place where he belonged was right there and he just didn't realize it. This was the catalyst that led to Griffith making the tragic mistake above, and stemmed from Guts' misjudgment of both Griffith and himself. Guts took Griffith's speech to Charlotte about what a friend is at face value, and always saw Griffith as a perfect figure looking down on everybody else. Even though Casca told him when they were hiding in a ravine that he was special to Griffith, and that Griffith was not a god but a vulnerable human like everybody else, Guts still couldn't see past his admiration for Griffith or realize that he wasn't inferior to Griffith. He thought that Griffith didn't need him, and that the only way to prove that he was Griffith's equal was to go out and find his own dream. A year after that Casca tells him how wrong he was, saying that Griffith fell apart because he left.
</li><li> Casca's great mistake just before the Eclipse was telling Guts to leave her and Griffith behind and follow his own dream. Griffith happened to overhear the entire conversation, which drove him off the deep end, causing him to abscond with the wagon, crash in the shallows, and reunite with the Crimson Behelit at the moment when he was most emotionally vulnerable to temptation. Casca's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> was the combination of her loyalty toward Griffith, her dutiful and self-sacrificing nature, and the conflict that those first two created with the fact that her true romantic feelings were towards Guts. Even though she was forced to realize how physically disabled Griffith was by his torture, and knew how much Guts' departure had devastated him, she either ignored or failed to see the warning signs of how Griffith's feelings of despair, jealousy, and spite were metastasizing into something dangerous. Griffith had always been the savior from her childhood, and even though she later learned of his human weakness she never could have imagined him turning on her and Guts. When Griffith made an unwanted advance on her while she was changing his bandages—essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">Attempted Rape</a> if not for his physical disability—she was devastated but couldn't admit to herself or to Guts that that's what had just happened. Instead of reacting with anger, she gave Griffith what he wanted least: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontYouDarePityMe">pity</a>. Casca decided to stay with Griffith, but Griffith would always know that she did it out of pity and would never love him the way that she loved Guts. Worse, she told Guts to leave when she knew that he was the person that Griffith most cared about, because she didn't want Guts to give up his dream for the sake of her and Griffith, and felt intense guilt for not staying at Guts' side like they'd promised as lovers. In order not to have made that mistake, she would have had to not be Casca anymore, since her tragic mistake was something she did out of her noble but flawed sense of self-sacrifice and obligation.

He had intended to embrace her Special Administrative Zone wholeheartedly, but he didn't know until it was too late that he was suffering from a sudden onset of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a>: an offhand comment became an irrevocable command, and he was forced to kill his beloved sister, tarnish her name, and destroy a fleeting chance at peaceful resolution</span>.
<ul><li> Suzaku commits two major tragic mistakes. The first is killing his father, which more or less guarantees Britannia's conquest of Japan and results in Suzaku becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a>. The second is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">having the FLEIJA loaded onto the Lancelot- since Suzaku is still under the effects of a Geass that compels him to "Live!" he's compelled to fire it when Kallen's about to kill him and he has no other options to fend her off, thus destroying Tokyo, killing millions of people and causing him to take part in the Zero Requiem to atone for this action</span>.

Because Kyubey is treacherous, because Sayaka's seemingly selfless wish was made with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlySelfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretlySelfish">Secretly Selfish</a> intentions, and because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until Madoka's wish</span> all those who make the contract with Kyubey are doomed to become witches, Homura is right. Sayaka commits a further act of Hamartia by refusing to cleanse her Soul Gem, because she's in despair from seeing Kyousuke Kamijou (her childhood friend, on whose behalf she made the wish, and who she never had the courage to confess to — which isn't helped by a certain reveal about what mahou shoujo are leading her to believe that she is no longer human) accepting Hitomi Shizuki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession">Love Confession</a>. Her despair not only turns her into a witch, but leads to both her own death and that of her rival-turned-friend Kyouko Sakura.
<ul><li> For the villains' side: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Incubators never expected that Homura's seemingly simple wish would cause an infinitely amplifying chain reaction that would derail their entire system since it ended up creating a God and a Devil with powers beyond anyone's control.</span>
</li><li> In the spinoff, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiOrikoMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PuellaMagiOrikoMagica">Puella Magi Oriko Magica</a></em>, Madoka makes such a mistake when she goes over to help Homura, thereby resulting in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Oriko being able to kill her with her final attack, thus causing Homura to reset time so that she can prevent Madoka's death</span>.

Years later, in Side:Future, Munakata, having become unhinged, stabs Sakakura over the previous incident. Sakakura survives, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but ends up performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to end the Final Killing Game and redeem himself</span>.

Saburo survived, but the two men's friendship was irrevocably ruined, and Kuroda became quite cynical and bitter over the betrayal.

The story has all the elements of the tragedy...except Luther never seems to really make the mistake that leads to his doom. From the moment he grabs the Hercules Method, to the end of the strip, his fate is decided. Even his first confrontation with the Librarian fails purely because of the Librarian's strength.

The crime for which he was punished was that he killed his father and married his mother - but due to circumstances completely beyond his control, Oedipus never knew that they were related to him. On the other hand, you could say that this wouldn't have happened if Oedipus had not, in his pride, quarreled with and killed another chariot driver - a chariot driver who ultimately turns out to be his father.
<ul><li> That said, he had the option to not investigate these circumstances, but that wouldn't have changed the fact that they still happened, and his people were suffering as a direct result of it.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>: In Act 3, the eponymous prince learns that Claudius was indeed guilty of murdering his father, and catches Claudius unawares while praying. Instead of avenging his father right there, Hamlet decides that it's not good enough - he wants Claudius to die with unpaid sin on his soul, so killing him in the act of confessing won't do. Hamlet resolves to kill Claudius later. The fallout: Hamlet does attempt to kill Claudius later, during his confrontation with his mother, only to kill Polonius instead by mistake. The death of Polonius drives Hamlet's lover Ophelia to madness and death, angering her brother Laertes enough to challenge Hamlet to a duel - the duel that ultimately results in the death of nearly every named character.
<ul><li> For extra irony, just after we see Hamlet leave, Claudius notes that his praying is nothing more than lip service and he doesn't truly feel sorry for the murder.

Granted, Tybalt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">probably deserved it</a>, but everything still goes to hell for both lovers because of it. This is a particularly interesting turning point because until then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfwayPlotSwitch">the story plays out exactly like a standard Elizabethan romantic comedy</a>, which would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">inevitably</a> have paired up both of the eponymous lovers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares">and probably Paris and Rosalind into the bargain</a>) <em>and</em> made their parents put aside their differences.
<ul><li> It may be even earlier then that... as Romeo unintentionally <em>provokes</em> Mercutio into dueling with Tybalt and thus gets him killed. By acting inexplicably nice to Tybalt, Mercutio was angered because it seemed like Romeo was being a coward (Mercutio didn't know about Romeo's marriage to Juliet).

It only takes him a few scenes to realise his error, but the fallout is severe: the deaths of Cornwall, Gloucester, Cordelia, Goneril, Regan, Edmund, and finally, Lear himself. The ending also implies that Kent is about to kill himself too, leaving only Edgar and Albany behind to pick up the pieces.

From the moment he insists on a) the gratuitous "sacrifice" of Alarbus and b) the crowning of Saturninus as emperor despite Bassianus being an immensely superior choice, the play's gruesome and devastating bloodbath is inescapable.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Othello">Othello</a></em>: Othello's point of no return probably occurs in Act III, Scene 4, when he engages in a pseudo-ceremony with Iago to swear vengeance against Desdemona and Cassio. Here he declares his mind will never change, and from this point on he never again doubts his delusional suspicions until after he has fatally smothered his wife.

If not for this decision, nothing more than a fist-fight would have occurred; however, Tony's interference backfired and provoked a fatal knife duel that directly and indirectly resulted in three deaths — Riff (killed by Bernardo), Bernardo (killed by Tony in vengeance for Riff) and Tony himself (killed by Chino in vengeance for Bernardo at the end).

It was a little settlement in a canyon for the Great Khans, a tribe that constantly harassed the NCR as they took over the region and expanded their territory. Eventually, soldiers were sent in to destroy the "base" at Bitter Springs and a group of 1st Recon NCR snipers deployed around the canyon's exit to ensure none of them managed to escape...but as the place burned, the Khans tried to get their women and children out first. Add in some confused communications, and the higher-ups still gave the order to fire. Result: 1st Recon snipers gunning down wounded non-combatants as they tried to run.
