</div></div><p>In any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">science fiction or fantasy</a> series, human beings are the most ephemeral of creatures. Every other sentient species lives at least as long as, and usually far longer than, human beings. The only exception are the brutish races: Trolls, Orcs, or Ogres - they mature faster. Ironically, humans have one of the longest lifespans of all mammals in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Of course, the inevitable follow-on from this is that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">humanoid</a> character may be well over a century in age but only look to be in his early thirties. This sometimes leads to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a> or, in extreme cases, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">Time Abyss</a>.
</p><p>In practice, humans age unusually slowly, compared to other mammals, for well-understood reasons. If an animal has a 90% chance of being killed by predators or disease by the age of three, there's no point in it being able to live to 30: instead, it will typically die of old age at around three. Thus, small animals, which have more predators, age faster, while birds, which are harder to catch, live much longer than mammals the same size, apart from bats, which have a similar lifespan to birds.
</p><p>These considerations can actually do a lot toward justifying both the trope and the "brutish monster" exception to the rule: An orc or ogre that lives by the sword will die by the sword at an earlier age, and will be better off if it reaches its prime fighting age earlier and has a set of teeth that are designed to be very effective in biting enemies instead of built to last eighty years. Similarly, it's common that the elves have created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVIllage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVIllage">a safe and isolated environment for themselves,</a> where they can reap the benefits of a lifespan that isn't cut short in a few decades.

The unusual bit is that even large mammals with almost as few predators as humans die of old age decades before humans, with the exception of some whales and elephants. Intelligent aliens should be similarly long-lived compared with their near relatives. If they've managed to slow down their aging process (through, say, genetic engineering), their natural lifespan could be long indeed, making this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justifiable trope.</a>

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> actually builds on this trope, with longer-lived races stating that they're impressed at how fully humans <em>live</em> their short lives compared to themselves.

Sesshoumaru, Inuyasha, Naraku, etc.) live far longer than any human, and while they may look spry and youthful, in reality they are many hundreds of years old. How quickly they mature relative to humans seems to vary.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Moriking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Moriking">Moriking</a></em>. Moriking explicitly points out that an insect's life is short, and rhinoceros beetles are not expected to live longer than the fall after emerging from their pupae in the summer. Shota promises to take care of Moriking until the end of his natural lifespan, while Shoko displays shock at the notion that these human-like bugs would die so quickly.

</li><li> Non-human/animal folk in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">magic world</a> live several times longer than the human species, and it shows up in their aging as evidenced by Princess Theodora. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Asuna has been hinted to not be human, instead having been alive for <strike> twenty or thirty years</strike> at least a hundred years and probably more while looking <em>four</em>. She only started actually <em>growing up</em> physically until she went to Mahora.</span>
</li><li> Namekians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> live for at least 500 years. The Kaioshin live for about 75 million. Saiyans live about as long as humans, but they stay young longer.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yu Yu Hakusho</a></em>, the Spirit Royalty live exceptionally long times. Prince Koenma is only recently potty-trained, and claims to be at least 500 years old.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> kind of has this trope. In the OVA, ordinary alien Juraians live about the same length of time as humans, but members of the Galaxy Police who have undergone "body enhancement" live about three times as long, and members of the royal family who have bonded to Jurai trees can live for maybe 20,000 years. Other characters like Ryoko, Washu, and Kagato can live for thousands of years for other reasons. In short, lifespan of a human being (for a wide definition of a "human") in Kajishima's canon is directly corresponding to one's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">awesomeness</a></em>. The more ass you kick, the longer you live, plain and simple.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em> with the Windermerians, who only live about thirty years on average. The difference is illustrated when, speaking of his mother, Hayate mentions he hasn't seen her in quite a while. When Freyja says how sad that is, he absent-mindedly replies, "Eh, it's only a few years.",<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0v55s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0v55s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0v55s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Freyja is already fourteen and thus have just twenty years <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Hayate</span> <em>at most</em>, so a "few years" for Hayate is a huge chunk of life for her.</span> which makes Freyja wince and look even more sad. Hayate looks like he's mentally kicking himself for that comment.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a>:Re</em>, with one of the variants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrids</a>. The most common result of a human and a ghoul mating is a Half-Human, a being that possesses enhanced physical abilities but no other ghoul traits. Unfortunately, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> and have a significantly shortened lifespan compared to either parent species. While their external appearance remains youthful, they start suffering age-related conditions in their 20s and are considered elderly if lucky enough to live into their 30s. The oldest known example was going blind from Glaucoma at the ripe old age of 32. Since they're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a> used as living weapons, their already-shortened lives are further reduced by the likelihood of dying in battle.
</li><li> Fairies and Giants in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins">The Seven Deadly Sins</a></em> have extremely long lifespans, and tend to see time accordingly. When Diane and King lived together, they shared a meal with a peasant. By the time they got around to seeing him again, he was an old man. Neither of them noticed that so much time had passed.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible">Invincible</a></em> both plays this straight and subverts it. Invincible's dad comes from a race of superpowered moustache-wearing aliens that live for thousands of years, but he still gets to meet a race which can live a lifetime in around a year, and yet are very intelligent. He had a kid with one of them, Oliver; Oliver's lifespan is uncertain, possibly an average between those of his parents, but he aged from "infant" to "teenager" in maybe two years. He also <em>really</em> managed to piss Mark off during their <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">epic battle</span> by comparing Mark's mother to a pet whom he would long outlive.
</li><li> The elves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em> are descended from spacegoing aliens who had overcome aging and disease. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Wolfrider elves have wolf DNA, courtesy of their shapeshifting ancestor Timmain, which gives them a finite lifespan - a mere few thousand years or so. The creation of the Wolfriders was necessary in order to make their adopted planet accept the elves as part of its ecology.</span> Furthermore all elves have immortal spirits. Trolls and Preservers are also extremely long-lived, but humans and wolves have normal lifespans.
</li><li> It varies depending on the canon, but (at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PostCrisis">Post-Crisis</a>) it's generally accepted that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> is essentially immortal, having stopped aging in his late 20's. He can still be killed in battle (and has been) but as long as he can avoid that, he can live forever. This leads to the unfortunate fact that all his friends and loved ones — including his wife <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LoisLane">Lois</a> — will turn old and gray while the Man of Steel remains young. Not really an issue thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCOneMillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCOneMillion">DC One Million</a></em> we learn that Superman is still alive in the <em>853rd century.</em> He's spent the last hundred millennia in the heart of the sun, becoming super-charged by its rays to the point that he is essentially a god. All this, just so he can use his new powers to bring Lois back from the dead so they can live together eternally.
</li><li> It's implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sleepwalker">Sleepwalker</a> and his race are extremely long-lived, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Cobweb</a> has been ravaging the Mindscape since before recorded time and Sleepwalker has fought him on many occasions.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSmurfs">The Smurfs</a> are definite long-livers compared to humans — they can live up to 600 years (Grandpa Smurf is a few centuries beyond that) and still remain active and sprightly. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">animated</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSmurfs">adaptation</a>, it's mostly due to the Long Life Stone which gives the Smurfs their longevity, though its power must be replenished every 1000 years or the Smurfs will suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapidAging">Rapid Aging</a> that leads to their death.

<ul><li> Mentioned by name in one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> novel. The Clans, a faction of humans descended from an army that left the bulk of human-controlled space (the Inner Sphere) behind centuries ago, use a program of genetic engineering to breed new, supposedly vastly improved generations of warriors every five years. Because the superiority of their breeding program is indisputable (to them, at least) a warrior facing warriors two or three generations younger than he or she is will be hopelessly outmatched. Most Clan warrior careers are over by the age of about thirty. In negotiating a truce between the Clans and the Inner Sphere, the Inner Sphere representative, Anastasius Focht, wants a long truce, initially proposing "forever." The Clan representative, ilKhan Ulric Kerensky, is pushing for a short truce (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">even though he's opposed to the invasion in the first place,)</a> because of the rapid nature of Clan warrior careers. As Focht asks for thirty years, to give the Inner Sphere a full generation to advance their technology (which is hopelessly far behind that of the Clans) and training, Ulric replies that the Clans "are as mayflies to you." The eventually agree on a fifteen-year truce.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em>, the guerilla war between the Animorphs and the Yeerk Empire lasted three years and shaped the fates and lives of thousands of sapient creatures. The larger war between the Andalites and Yeerks was on a scale even larger. But in the end, the entire conflict was only a blip so small as to be unnoticeable when it came to the war between Ellimist and Crayak. The kids' war lasted three years, the war between Ellimist and Crayak lasted <em>hundreds of millions</em> or even <em>billions</em> of years, one that continues even after the Yeerk Empire is destroyed. If one looks at the series as a battle between good and evil, <em>absolutely nothing was accomplished</em>. What's one Yeerk Empire to Crayak?
<ul><li> It's implied that the war is more critical than it seems, for reasons that will only be clear to the mortals of the galaxy a century or two down the line.
</li><li> True, considering how much the Yeerk war influenced the budding, new conflict between humans, Andalites, Yeerks, <em>Kelbrid</em> and The One:

When humans make contact with the cheela, they inadvertently start an industrial revolution. They start transmitting their encyclopedia. It takes the cheela many generations to decrypt and interpret the message, but after <em>six hours</em> they know as much science as the humans do. After <em>twelve hours</em>, they have developed faster-than-light travel, flown throughout much of the galaxy, and transmitted a message back to the humans with everything that they learned, encrypted so that the humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady">will only gain knowledge at a rate that we can handle</a>. What happens to the cheela later is not specified.

<ul><li> Vlad lampshades this in his early life, remarking that, given the <em>functional</em> life expectancies of members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMafia">the Jhereg</a>, he really doesn't have to worry about lifespan differences between himself and his Dragaeran associates.
</li><li> One Dragaeran, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Sethra Lavode</a>, is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> around 220,000 years old.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HisDarkMaterials">His Dark Materials</a></em>, Serafina Pekkala, the witch Queen, discusses the impossibility of equal relationships between men and witches due to the lifespan issue; witches live for many hundreds of years. Angels in His Dark Materials live even longer; at one point an explicit comparison is made that as human life is to witches', so are witch lifespans to angels'. Pullman also inverts the trope with the Gallivespians, tiny human-shaped people who reach maturity rapidly and die after living roughly ten years.
</li><li> Inverted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VernorVinge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VernorVinge">Vernor Vinge</a> short story "Original Sin", in which the alien Shimans have such a short lifespan that they have to specialize intensively or risk wasting their entire life becoming educated. For instance, someone trained in a certain scientific process might have relatively little experience in communication, and would thus be unable to explain it to anyone.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">Tolkien</a> worked human jealousy of the unlimited lifespan of the Elves into a plot point in the story of the fall of Númenor.
<ul><li> However, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> reveals that death, far from being a disadvantage of Men, is actually intended by Eru as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">gift to the race</a>, allowing them to depart from the world early and go on, presumably returning to existence beyond Middle-Earth, while the Elves are stuck on Middle-earth until its end, thus resulting in their growing wistfulness and melancholy as they see the world around them changing and decaying. Death also allows Men greater defiance of Fate.
</li><li> Even the Númenóreans are long-lived compared to other humans (most Númenóreans can live to 200—the royal line, which has Elvish blood, can live up to twice that). Dwarves have a similar lifespan—they live to about 250 on average. For that matter, so are Hobbits: a hobbit comes of age at thirty-three, and it's not uncommon for them to live well over a century.
</li></ul></li><li> Also appears in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington">Honor Harrington</a> series, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a>. Humanity has a anti-aging drug regimen that must be started as early as possible to be most effective. This also leads to a interesting variation: Being that the regimen (called "prolong") has different versions that were developed at different times, this trope can happen <em>three ways</em> normals -&gt; first-gen -&gt; second-gen -&gt; third-gen, where people that are in their seventies and have a full space-navy career can appear to be in their early teens to those who have not experienced the effects.
<ul><li> There's profound socio-economic effects too. First Generation Prolong was only discovered around a century ago, and on rich planets like Manticore there isn't anyone physically over 40, and the life span will go for 300 years. 3rd Generation like Honor will go much farther, 500 is possible. For many worlds, the promise of Prolong being administered for free as a Government program is a major plot point. This causes what's practical in governments to change. One Government's Annexation bid will gradually rewrite districts in the new federal government, with the core nation having dominance written in for the next 20 years, and ending fully in 70 years. Given that the prolong makes this nothing on a human lifespan makes it work.
</li><li> This trope lent an undertone of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">tragedy</a> to the early relations between humans and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BondCreatures">treecats</a>. The 'cats are very long-lived, as in 250-300 years. The first treecat to bond with a human, Climbs Quickly/Lionheart, did so when he was about 50 (a young adult), and she was 11. When she died at about 104 years old, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">suicided</a> soon after, having lived only about half of his natural span. Treecats continued to bond, because they considered the results worth the price. The advent of prolong for humans served to remove <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">the Suck from the Blessing</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> James Blish's excellent <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CitiesInFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CitiesInFlight">Cities in Flight</a></em> series does the same thing, with two drugs - one that holds off aging, and one that prevents almost all disease. Unfortunately, the supply is limited, so only those who can prove their worth to society are ever started on the drugs - and some people are considered just too old to start now.
<ul><li> Later in the series' continuity, the longevity drugs are used as currency, because they're basically impossible to counterfeit and they can be diluted to make change. This is okay for the planetbound cultures, who just age and die normally. For the Okies, who need them <em>as drugs</em> if they want to survive the journey from system to system, it doesn't work so well.

<ul><li> In the <em>Future History</em> stories, there are a group of humans, referred to as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Families">Howard Families<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who live inordinately long lives, in comparison to "normal" humans. One member of the Family, Lazarus Long (among other names) has lived, as of the last work by Heinlein on the subject before the author passed away, about 2,000 years, give or take a century, and is still going strong. Although the advancing march of science eventually created a rejuvenation technology capable of working on normal humans, ironically out of the human race's mistaken belief that the Howard Families were hiding the 'secret' of longevity drugs. This sparked a massive planetwide research effort to 'rediscover' the 'secret' after humanity's initial attempt to make the Howards yield the 'secret' up by force obviously failed. The rejuvenation therapies also work on Howards, who routinely use them to extend their lifespans even longer — Lazarus Long would not have reached 2000+ years of age without rejuvenation, although his natural lifespan was unusually long even by Howard Families standards.
</li><li> In Heinlein's standalone novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarBeast">The Star Beast</a></em> Lummox had been the Stuart family pet for four generations or 120 years, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and was still a child by her species' standards</span>. It is also stated that humanity is the shortest lived sapient species in the known universe.

This includes the pure-blooded Tiste Andii, Tiste Liosan and Tiste Edur (being invaders from either a different world that is at the same time the origin of Order and magic this shouldn't surprise anyone), the Jaghut, T'lan Imass (who turned their whole people into undead in order to extinguish the Jaghut) and most likely the Thelomen Toblakai and K'Chain Che'Malle matrons as well. Also immortal (unless killed, which happens a lot) is every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Ascendant</a>, god, dragon, greater demon or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">personification of a principle</a>. Add to that age-defying alchemy and sorcery and a lot the characters appearing in the books are significantly older than the current civilizations with a few going up to 500.000 years, or even as old as existence.
</li><li> Robert Jordan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> has the Ogier  for them, ninety years or so amounts to young adulthood, while the channelers (magic users) can live as long as six centuries, under the right circumstances.

And then there are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Great Old Ones</a> and other godlike beings, which are truly immortal. In fact, some of them are actually older than the entire universe!
<div class="indent">That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die.

After all, she really is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Great Old One</a> even if she <em>looks</em> like a teenager.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IainBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IainBanks">Iain M.

Also invoked when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture">Culture</a> ship investigates Earth, and the ship tells our narrator:
<div class="indent">"Their children's children will die before you even look old, Diziet. Their grandparents are younger than you are now..."
</div></li><li> Played with in the old short story "They Live Forever" where a man is found who has clearly lived for centuries without aging. The immortal brushes off questions saying that he is exactly like everyone else where he comes from. The narrator's grandfather decides to find the planet of eternal youth but their ship crashes on a different planet, killing the entire crew except the boy. Eventually the narrator befriends the natives who live for at most fifteen years. As the story ends he is seventy-four and when a child asks how old he is the narrator realizes the natives don't have a concept of that length of time so he says he doesn't remember. He leaves, depressed, and the child's mother assures the little girl that the narrator is simply immortal.
<ul><li> Another story with a forgotten title involved an immensely long-lived alien recruiting a team of humans to travel to another planet and help advance the civilization of a sentient species who exist in a blur of speed and whose lifespan is measured in <em>hours</em>. The team quickly learns that being "immortal" is no picnic...
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the subsequent species of man in Olaf Stapledon's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastAndFirstMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastAndFirstMen">Last and First Men</a></em> live much longer than the "First Men", in fact after one of several societal collapses the average lifespan drops below 40 (until a long-lived mutant starts a religion and spreads his genes). The Second Men live for over 190 years. The Eighteenth Men live an average lifespan of 250,000 years and do not die of old age. That reads like a logical contradiction, but it's not: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they die when the sun turns into a red giant ahead of schedule</span>.

Its people live, grow old and die within ten days, at a rate of about a decade a day. When the heroes discover and take shelter in the forgotten ship's sealed interior, they're astonished to find they're no longer growing old, and speculate that without the solar radiation's effects, humans might live to an unthinkable one hundred days old.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In Dutch author Paul Harland's novel <em>Water to Ice</em>, one of the protagonists is a many-thousands-of-years old man who was made immortal by aliens. His particular variation is interesting: Like Dorian Gray, his "aging" is transferred to a transcendental "painting" of him. After so many centuries, he wants the thrill of being able to die back, so he placed the picture in a vault, which is then sunk into the corona of a star. It could go at any moment, but it's impossible to predict <em>when</em>. However, he also describes an encounter he once had with a species of electromagnetic beings, which exist for only fifteen <em>minutes</em> at a time before dying forever, and how their joy and wisdom is a constant soothing memory to him. Unfortunately, when he meets his original benefactors - aliens who see it as their holy mission to banish mortality from the universe - they inform him casually that they have since bestowed immortality on aforementioned ephemeral beings. He then triggers his vault to open.

<ul><li> Most Barsoomians voluntarily undergo a pilgrimage upon reaching the age of 1000 (at which time they're still physically in their prime) down the River Iss to what their legend tells them is paradise (they're actually eaten, either by beasts or by the Therns, at the end of the journey). Ras Thavas, who doesn't believe in any such mystical claptrap and avoids physical confrontation, is pretty close to dying of old age when first encountered ... he's probably about 2500 (Barsoomian years, so around 5000 Earth years).

He himself is at least 1,600 years old. During the course of the story, he and other characters encounter an planet where people on it live an Amish-like style of life, where re-booting technology is not used, so people die in fewer than 100 years.

The biggest changes from modern times include various fantasy races living side-by-side with humans and various pieces of technology being alive and having to be tamed instead of built.

Even worse, a community of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanSubspecies">Human Subspecies</a> called Longers was found in Big New-York that have a lifespan roughly double that of normal humans.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArrivalsFromTheDark">Arrivals from the Dark</a></em>, with medical advances, humans can expect to live for several more decades past 100. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Faata</a>, the very first alien race encountered by humanity, has its ruling caste live for many centuries (some have been alive for over 1000 years). On the other hand, all the other castes are genetically engineered to live for a few years at most. This is topped by the next race officially encountered by humans, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Lo'ona Aeo</a>, who routinely live for many millennia (if not tens of millennia), partly because they have willingly became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePeople">Space People</a>, since living aboard specially-constructed orbital habitats tends to be safer than on a planetary surface, and environments can be adjusted to promote longevity. This also affects how they perceive youth. For example, a Lo'ona Aeo, who is in his 90s, is seen as a brash teenager by his elders. When one book's protagonist meets his Lo'ona Aeo brother (long story), the brother expresses his sorrow over the death of their father. The protagonist is surprised, pointing out that their father died in battle decades ago, and that he has already made peace with it. The alien explains that, for his long-lived species, it seems as if it happened yesterday. Additionally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">human-Faata hybrids</a> and their descendants can potentially live for 150-200 years, although no one has actually live that long due to many of them dying in battle or for other reasons. It's called the "Corcoran curse", since it also means that the male hybrids mature very late in their lives and are unable to have children until they're in their fifties. There is also a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshifters</a>, who can live for millennia (it helps when you can alter your cellular makeup at will), which is compensated by their extremely low birthrate. It's mentioned that most other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Aliens</a> have lifespans comparable to humans. Inverted for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Dromi</a>, whose incredibly high population growth compensates for their short lifespans. A typical Dromi, who doesn't die a violent death (unlikely), can expect to life to about 40-50 human years. The higher Dromi castes are older than that but only thanks to Lo'ona Aeo-supplied longevity treatments that must be administered regularly. Even then, the fact that their bodies continue to grow with age means that, eventually, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquareCubeLaw">Square-Cube Law</a> kills them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> stars colonies of stray and feral cats. The cast is lucky to make it to 7 years old due to the large amount of fighting, the high child mortality rate, and the risk of dying in winter.

<ul><li> The basic character races are all longer-lived than humanity, with the exception of half-orcs, whose average lifespan is about 40 years. However, the nonhuman races all take longer to mature, as well — a "young adult" elf is 100 years old, while a dwarf takes forty years.
</li><li> Elans are arguably the prime example of this here. They can sustain themselves indefinitely without food or water, and are incapable of dying of old age. However, they're actually humans that have been altered through a "mysterious psionic ritual."
</li><li> On the other end, there are the Thri-keen, a race of psionic insect-people. Their maximum age? 29.
</li><li> Half-orcs have a shorter lifespan because their non-human parents, orcs, have a shorter lifespan. Indeed, most of the "evil" "brute" races tend to have a slightly shorter lifespan, ranging from dying in their 60s to dying in their 40s.
</li><li> Early <em>D&amp;D</em> editions give gnolls a life expectancy of 35 years.

<ul><li> Eldar are virtually immortal (Eldrad Ulthran, one of their leaders, was alive and active at the time of the Great Crusade, 10,000 years ago).
</li><li> Orks only grow stronger as they age; thus, they have the <em>potential</em> for immortality (but due to their violent natures, they seldom live long).
</li><li> On the flip side, Tau and Kroot have natural less-than-human life expectancies (around 40 year in the Tau case, though Kroot can prolong their lives by assimilating the DNA of longer-lived creatures). Their awareness of their pitifully short lifespans probably at least partially explains her hyper-ambition.
</li><li> Humans themselves, due to things such as gene treatment, cybernetics and the odd effects Warp travel has on aging, have the potential to live for several centuries — or at least, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">Haves do</a>. Space marines, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> humans, also have the potential to live for centuries (Most gene-lines start showing signs of age-related degradation at around 500 and are killed in battle before too long. The closest thing to a death by old age was one who had been required to stay in a room on a ship that was subsequently abandoned. When he was rescued after 10,000 years he was so fragile that he didn't survive being moved).
</li><li> Chaos Marines, due to the power gained by being card-carrying members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">The Legions of Hell</a> and living in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Negative Space Wedgie</a> where "time" and "continuity" are more guidelines than set rules, live for thousands or tens of thousands of years.

Being skeletons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">in SPACE</a>, the Necrons don't really count for this, but their Star Gods, the C'tan, who have lived for <em>billions</em> of years, do.
<ul><li> Played with in the Necron's backstory, the Necrontyr had short lives and were really jealous of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Old Ones</a> who lived for very long times, the C'tan got the Necrontyr to transform their bodies with living metal, the transformation dulled their minds and senses, and thus we have the Necrons, Warrior-Robots of the C'tan.
</li><li> The C'tan are hinted to be born at the birth of the Galaxy, making them the oldest beings in the universe with no exceptions (predating even the Chaos Gods, although that can be contested due to the laws of the universe not working in the Warp).
</li><li> The fact that both the Necrontyr and the Tau have/had such short life expectancies has led to some interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">Epileptic Trees</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also Asdrubael Vect, leader of the Dark Eldar, who is supposedly old enough to have remembered the founding of Commorragh and to have witnessed the birth of Slaanesh (making him one of the few, if not only, mortals older than a Chaos God).
<ul><li> His backstory has since been retconned, as it's flatly stated there were many older than him and he was not the founder of Commorragh, as he was but a mere slave even after it's founding.
</li></ul></li><li> Craftworld Eldar skirts on this since that their "death" is simply being sealed inside a stone so their souls are not devoured. They are fully capable of being "reanimated" when placed in Wraithbone armor (although in doing so the spirit can never be put to rest again). Farseers in particular become gigantic walls of sentient crystal, meaning they could live forever so long as their craft world isn't destroyed.
</li></ul></li><li> Warhammer plays this trope pretty straight. Humans have the standard 50-100 year lifespan we are used to (albeit with medieval or early modern levels of health and medicine, and the concurrent reduced average life expectancy), while Dwarfs can live for many hundreds of years and Elves for a couple thousand. The Slann and their Lizardmen servants are older still. Ogres and Halflings tend to have lifespans similar to those of humans. Indeed, the comparative briefness of human life is why only man has pursued and developed Necromancy - magic to extend life and cheat death is of little use to already virtually immortal Elves. The humans of ancient Nehekhara tended to live about five times as long as modern ones due to a pact they made with their gods, though all of this long-lived breed have been wiped out and rendered undead. At the other end of the scale are the Skaven - chaotic rat-men who generally only live for twenty years (though their leaders can extend that to a couple of centuries using dark magics). The lifespan of Orcs and Goblins has not really been touched upon, though given the race's penchant for perpetual violent warfare it is unlikely that many of them ever get to find out either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>: The process of Exaltation <em>greatly</em> expands a person's life span. The Dragon-Blooded, who get the short end of the stick, typically live for several centuries, and the Scarlet Empress was around for close to 800 years before she disappeared. Solars and Lunars can typically live up for several millennia; Ingosh Silverclaws, one of the oldest-lived Lunars in the setting, died of old age at somewhere around 3100. The Sidereals, who get even greater longevity, can live for close to <em>6,000</em> years; there are Sidereals still around who remember the Primordial War and one who is older than history itself. Needless to say, when you live that long, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglePower">mortals swiftly fall out of your peer group... and possibly your notice</a>.
<ul><li> The Abyssal, Alchemical and Infernal Exalted also fit this. The first two are immortal, due to being undead/robots respectively, while the Infernals replace the Dragon-Blooded in being the shortest lived Exalted, with a lifespan of only 150 years.

Metabolic testing has shown that elves are mortal, but in the 70 years since they appeared none have shown visible signs of aging. Dwarves seem to be similarly long-lived. Since numerous dragons are confirmed to have survived since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn">Fourth Age</a>, they're all assumed to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A small number of elves are also fourth world survivors.</span>

The main character is an immortal who is doomed to outlive everyone he cares about: Wives, children, friends, everyone. The game milks it for all it's worth - almost all of the "Thousand Years of Dreams" content touches on some variation on the theme, mostly for drama, sometimes for laughs: <a class="urllink" href="http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=-6Q0iMl0jeY">MAMAAAAAAAAAAAAA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

Most of them are <em>much</em> older than they look (such as the protagonist, Laharl, who looks to be about 13 despite being over 13 <em>hundred</em> years old).

Meanwhile, humans "don't even live to 100".
</li><li> Eventually averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em> universe. The night elves <em>were</em> immortal... but they gave up their immortality in order to drive back the Burning Legion. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> opens with the night elves coping with the fact that they're going to start dying natural deaths for the first time in... well, forever.
<ul><li> Still played straight, though, in certain expanded universe sources that may or may not be canon. While night elves are no longer immortal, they still have lifespans of more than 1000 years. They're freaking out about losing immortality mainly because that's much shorter than they were going to live without it. It's also suggested that their lifespans might "catch up with them"; Tyrande Whisperwind was a young adult when immortality went into affect. 10,000 years later, seven years after immortality was lost, she'd developed crow's feet. It's debated whether this was caused by rapid aging or just the affects of stress. Among the other races, high/blood elves still live centuries, as do gnomes and dwarves. Draenei lifespans are a mystery but there are some over 25,000 years old. Even the normally short lived races catch up to humans, trolls and orcs only live a couple decades shorter than the average human.
</li><li> Dragons live for tens of thousands of years. This becomes a plot point in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheAncients" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarOfTheAncients">The War of the Ancients</a></em> trilogy, where the red dragon Korialstrasz (under the guise of an elf mage named Krasus) ends up in the distant past, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneMeAllowedRightNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyOneMeAllowedRightNow">problems pop up due to him coexisting with his younger self</a>. Apparently, life force and magic are shared between them.
</li></ul></li><li> A plot point that was lampshaded several times by the long lived laguz of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>. All laguz and those with laguz ancestry have extended life spans, triply so with the Dragon Tribe. When several dragon allies from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTellius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTellius">Path of Radiance</a></em> encounter Ike and friends in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTellius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTellius">Radiant Dawn</a></em> they are somewhat awed that the Greil Mercs look different and are surprised that Ike and Co. miss them.

<ul><li> This is also brought up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> with Tiki and Nowi, both dragons. Nowi is a thousand years old but still looks like a preteen girl, and while Tiki's aged physically since <em>Shadow Dragon</em>, she looks nowhere near as old as she really is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Fire Emblem: Binding Blade</a></em>, this is also an issue for the divine dragon Fa. She is centuries old yet looks like a human child of about six. She doesn't understand why Igrene's daughter "went away" and breaks down when the half-dragon Sophia tries to explain that Fa will outlive all of her human friends, and Sophia herself, by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">an incomprehensible amount of time</a>. Sophia herself is about a hundred years old, and neither she or Fa look any different than they did when they made cameos in the prequel.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>. In general.

Gods can live for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">as long as they are worshipped</a>. Ghosts can last forever. Poltergeist have theoretically limited existences, but that can still be for quite some time. Fairies are technically an inversion, but they respawn immediately after death, and are functionally immortal. Then there's the Lunarians, who are humans that live on the moon. The moon lacks impurity, which is what causes death, so they end up being space elves.

He believes that humans are always dogged by the fear of death due to their relatively short lifespans and are driven to achieve as much as possible while simultaneously rarely living long enough to see the consequences of their own actions.
<div class="indent"><strong>Loghaire</strong>: When a human looks upon something he thinks "how can I use this", when he should be thinking "what are the consequences of it's use?"

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Paladins">Paladins</a></em>, this is inverted for fairies.

One NPC in Zora's Domain recalls playing with Link when they were kids, but although Link has been in stasis for the past century and has an excuse to still have a youthful appearance, the Zora also looks like a young adult. In a sidequest, you can additionally hook up a human man and a Zora girl who are around the same age temporally—but the human is an adult while the Zora is still a child (physically anyway: according to the Zora, they mature emotionally and mentally before they do physically, so there's a relatively brief window where they have the mind of an adult and the body of a child).

<ul><li> In an extreme example, the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Transformers</a> may very well be incapable of dying of old age, so long as they remain properly nourished. Indeed, throughout the entire franchise, no Transformer has ever been observed to die of natural causes, on or offscreen. The characters from the first series went into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">suspended animation</a> four million years ago, and when they woke up, all their old acquaintances were still fighting the war. They're rarely shown as being affected by old age (except for one character, Kup), and one character, Vector Prime, may very well be nearly as old as time itself.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers">movies</a> add <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan">Jetfire</a> to the list. Apart from being <em>one of the first Transformers to ever live</em>, his aging is explained as from being starved of energon. He even comments that his father was the <em>first wheel,</em> ("What did he transform into? Nothing! But he did it with honour!") It is however conceivable that energon starvation and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheIsolation">hiding in a museum with nobody to talk to for several years</a> has made Jetfire go a bit peculiar, or that he's just trying to mess with Sam's head when he says this. The Fallen, one of the original Thirteen, is even older and is still spry from better care over the years.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nibblonians from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em> have very long lifespans. Nibbler is at least 1000 years old and still seems "youthful" for his species.
<ul><li> Inexplicably, the Nibblonian race itself is seventeen years older than <em>the universe</em>.

Thanks to perceptual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDissonance">Time Dissonance</a>, to a Petalar, that single day is an incredibly rich, full and meaningful lifetime.

</li><li> A short stop motion film called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DasRad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DasRad">Das Rad</a>" involved two perspective of time between two sentient piles of rocks named Hew and Kew, and the humans who, over thousands of years, progress from cavemen to building a future metropolis which rot and fade away at the end of the film. Being rocks, Hew and Kew act and talk so slowly that centuries pass during their conversations and the humans who pass by (which are barely visible to the rocks due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDissonance">Time Dissonance</a>) see them as ordinary piles of unmoving rocks. At one point, Kew picks up a broken wooden wheel discarded next to him by a human pulling a rickshaw passing by and inspects it in curiosity before it rots and biodegrades into nothingness.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>: it's heavily implied that Finn the Human and Jake the Dog were infants at the same time, Finn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">canine adoptive parents</a> died of old age leaving his older brother (now approaching middle age while Finn's barely an adolescent) to raise him. On the other hand, it's unclear just how rapidly Jake actually ages. Jake isn't exactly an ordinary dog either, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since he's the result of a shapeshifting alien creature implanting an egg in Joshua's head</span>.

It's not clear whether this is a characteristic of alicorns in general (the only other two to have been seen in the show were originally regular ponies who were turned into alicorns) or whether Celestia and Luna are a special case. Discord and Tirek are both (so far) the only representatives of their species (draconequus and demon-goat-centaur-thing, respectively), so it's unknown if they're naturally long lived or have artificially extended their lives with magic. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJournalOfTheTwoSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheJournalOfTheTwoSisters">The Journal of the Two Sisters</a></em> reveals that "natural" alicorns like Celestia and Luna are <em>very</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLived">Long-Lived</a>, though they are not immortal, though this is thrown for a loop in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> where Twilight Sparkle is shown to have become like Princess Celestia unlike her now elderly friends and Princess Flurry Heart has aged normally. Similarly, it's implied that Spike, being a dragon, has an extremely long lifespan as even in the distant finale he looks and sounds like a buff teenager whose voice hasn't even cracked yet.

The youngest of the Crystal Gems is over five thousand years old. Pearl at one point remarks that she remembers when humans were nothing but hunter-gatherers.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The diamonds are even more ancient. Although their exact ages haven't been confirmed yet, Yellow's remark in the movie that Spinel's 6,000 year long isolation was absolutely nothing implies that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeAbyss">they are probably millions of years old at the very least.</a></span>

It's also largely irrelevant because there are only two <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(actually three)</span> Alteans left alive.

Just when they think they can finally get a moment's rest, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">the eggs hatch and it starts all over again</a>.

When Timmy first meets him, the Fly starts out as a baby, then after saying that he has a 24-hour lifespan, he ages into a teenager. In the Fly's second scene, he is a college freshman. In his third scene, the Fly is married and has two sons (who both age into teenagers). In the Fly's fourth and final scene, he is elderly and his two sons are young adults, but all three meet their demise via a fly swatter.
