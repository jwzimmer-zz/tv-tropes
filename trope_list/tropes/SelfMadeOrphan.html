According to legend, when she saw the guard with his sword drawn, she said, <em>Ventrem feri</em>—"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousLastWords">Strike at my womb</a>."
</li><li> In Amityville, Long Island, New York, Ronnie DeFeo shot and killed his parents and four siblings in bed on November 13, 1974, at 3:15 am. The hauntings the book and movies based off of the book claimed aren't real, though, just the crime.
</li><li> In Bellevue, Idaho, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Marie_Johnson">Sarah Marie Johnson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, then 16, killed her parents on September 2, 2003, because they forbade her from dating a 19-year-old boy.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzane_von_Richthofen">Suzane von Richthofen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (<a class="urllink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5207124.stm">descendant of the<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a>) is a Brazilian girl that is in prison for killing both her parents when she was 19 years old, with help from her boyfriend and his brother. It made quite a sensation in the media.
</li><li> One case in Medicine Hat, Canada. A young girl, influenced by her much older boyfriend, murdered her entire family.
</li><li> In Finland, a teenaged girl coaxed some older boys to kill her mother over domestic differences; fortunately, the crossbow bolt intended to do the job only grazed her skull, and she managed to escape.
</li><li> In 1954, an incident happened in Christchurch, New Zealand where Pauline Parker and her friend Juliet Hulme killed her mother. Their story was made into the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenlyCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavenlyCreatures">Heavenly Creatures</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterJackson">Peter Jackson</a>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateWinslet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KateWinslet">Kate Winslet</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelanieLynskey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelanieLynskey">Melanie Lynskey</a> starred as the girls. Ironically, Hulme became a murder mystery writer after adopting the name Anne Perry when she was released.
</li><li> One that changed (a small part of) history: one fine summer evening in Nepal, Crown Prince Dipendra walked into a family dinner and shot the whole place up, killing his father, King Birendra, his mother, Queen Aishwarya, his two siblings, and five other relatives, before shooting himself in the head. He would take a few days to die, but not before being proclaimed King of Nepal while in a coma. As a result, his uncle Gyanendra took the throne. Through a long series of events, this massacre led to the abolition of the Nepalese monarchy in 2008.
<ul><li> That's the official version, anyway. Many in Nepal accused Gyanendra of being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> who arranged the massacre (in collaboration with Chinese spies) and framing Dipendra, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">so that he could have the throne for himself.</a> Fueling this theory is the claim that the right-handed Dipendra "shot himself" in the left side of his head, which is a relatively unlikely suicide. The theory persists even though Gyanendra's own wife, Komal, was wounded in the massacre.
</li></ul></li><li> In 2011, a seventeen-year-old boy by the name of <a class="urllink" href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/tyler-hadleys-killer-party-20131218">Tyler Hadley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> murdered his parents with a hammer. Then he threw a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildTeenParty">Wild Teen Party</a>.
</li><li> In 2015, a woman named Clauddine "Dee Dee" Blanchard was murdered and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> daughter Gypsy Rose disappeared. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/michelledean/dee-dee-wanted-her-daughter-to-be-sick-gypsy-wanted-her-mom?utm_term=.qnYDYWyG3#.fbEwGyz6K">It turns out<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that Dee Dee had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MunchausenSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MunchausenSyndrome">Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy</a> and, through several years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">she</a> forced Gypsy to pretend being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> (attracting both attention and benefits), until Gypsy got rid of her with the help of her online boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn.
</li><li> In the early 1970s, Michael Morgan of Georgia, under pressure of his wife Hollis Wingo Morgan, who threatened him to no longer let him see his children again, hired his brother and friends to murder his parents <a class="urllink" href="http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/124/67/index.html">and got a death sentence<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In the Spring of 2001, 17-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Natalie DeMola</a>, along with her boyfriend and his friend, killed her mother Kim because she had enough of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MamaBear">her overprotection</a> and tried to make it look like a home invasion gone wrong. They probably would have gotten away with it upon speeding away from the crime scene had they not had a traffic collision with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">the district attorney's car.</a></em> They all received life sentences.
</li><li> On Easter Sunday 1992, wealthy Californian college student Dana Ewell hired his two friends to shoot and kill his parents, Dale and Glee, and his older sister, Tiffany, to get his hands on their vast inheritances. While the men were able to easily kill his father and sister, his mother tried to run only to be chased down and finished off. All three men were eventually sentenced to life terms.
</li><li> Attempted but ultimately subverted with a Florida teenager, Jacqueline "Nikki" Reynolds in 1997. To wit, she was adopted by a loving Christian Fundamentalist couple as a baby, but grew into a rebellious/mentally ill teenager and began to date a boy who the parents did not approve of.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4w7v7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4w7v7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4w7v7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">but overall was <em>not</em> a bad guy; they disliked him due to him not being a good student and not having the same Christian standards that they shared. Even the night of the crime, he called Nikki's mother and apologized for all of the grief their past relationship had produced; she completely understood, even admitting that it was her <em>daughter</em> all along, who had grown obsessed with him to the point of even lying about being pregnant by him, who was the real cause of the problems</span> She soon believed that all of her problems would go away if she killed her mother then and there, kill the father after he came home from church and go to school the next day and kill her <em>ex-boyfriend</em>, but after brutally stabbing her mother and her eventually succumbing to her injuries, she regretted her actions and couldn't bring herself to carry out the other murders. She was sentenced to life the following year and her father and ex-boyfriend cut ties with her permanently.
</li><li> In October 2007, Daniel Petric shot his parents for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">denying him access to the latest "Halo" video game.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5vt55');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5vt55" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5vt55');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He had the game because he had suffered an injury that gave him a staph infection which permanently stopped him from playing sports and he ended up getting safer video games and after getting <em>Halo</em> and his parents learning the true nature of the game, got rid of it</span> He then fled and told police that it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderSuicide">Murder-Suicide</a> with his father, a <em>pastor</em>, shooting his wife and then himself. Instead, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">father survived</a>, the boy eventually admitted to what he did and he ultimately forgave his son and he was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole in 25 years.
