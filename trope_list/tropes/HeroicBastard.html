</div></div><p>While the badass hero or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> may get called a bastard, it's not usually meant literally. This trope is for the heroic protagonist for whom "bastard" is just a factual description, not a comment on their personality. They could easily be very pleasant and well-mannered, but their parents never married.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Until fairly recently in fiction, a child born out of wedlock was often expected to have a treacherous or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">villainous nature just due to the fact of his illegitimate birth</a>, which of course is how the term "bastard" came to mean someone who was...well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">a bastard</a>. In modern times, however, with the rise of more liberal and humane attitudes — as well as the rapid increase in unwed motherhood as a societal phenomenon — it has become less acceptable to assume that a person will have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheBlood">tendency toward evil behavior</a> just because Dad never gave Mom a ring or because Mom or Dad had the kid when one of the two already gave a ring to another person.
</p><p>Back in the day, this could be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfFulfillingProphecy">Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</a>. Since a child born out of wedlock would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">target of all kinds of discrimination and would not be allowed to participate in some central parts of society</a> (like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaithHeelTurn">church services</a>), they often had to become ruthless, cunning rogues just to have a chance of surviving. Especially since the fathers didn't have to care for them (and often wouldn't) and the mothers may have used the kid to let out their frustration about "those goddamn men". Fatherless children have a documented tendency to violence, suicide, lack of self-control, and poverty — so, statistically speaking, there's something to the stereotype, though how much of this is due to the social stigma is left as an exercise to the reader. But most bastards manage to rise above these expectations.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In fact, modern authors have found that making their hero a bastard can have some valuable dramatic benefits. Perhaps the parents never married because one of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">vanished mysteriously</a>; this can lead to a juicy revelation later in the story when it is discovered that Mom or Dad is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousParent">someone very important to the plot</a>. If the writer is feeling generous, the vanished parent could be a local power figure or at least wealthy. If not, the vanished parent could end up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">someone the hero has to fight</a>. At a minimum, being born a bastard and getting socially snubbed for it can give your character a reason to feel mistreated yet prove his heroic character by rising above it and saving the world anyway.
</p><p>Interestingly, if we look back far enough, we find that most of the greatest heroes of ancient Greek myth were born out of wedlock, making this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>. However, this generally only applied if the hero's parents didn't marry because one of them was a god — most often baby-daddy Zeus, who had serious fidelity issues with his goddess wife and was forever running around impregnating mortal women with heroes. It should be also be noted that in ancient Greece, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">"heroic" did not necessarily mean nice</a>, so many Greek heroes were bastards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">who were also bastards</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>If a heroic character is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">Child by Rape</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore">Son of a Whore</a>, he usually fits this trope as well. In some cases, it may be secondary to the other one.
</p><p>If the Heroic Bastard is also a heroic <em>bastard</em>, he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero">Sociopathic Hero</a>. And while the heroic bastard may be magnificent, he is not automatically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a>. For the villainous version, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">Bastard Bastard</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, Edward and Alphonse Elric have their mother's surname because she never officially married their father, Van Hohenheim, despite living with him for years and sharing a house with him. Hohenheim's failure to make an "honest woman" out of Trisha Elric is in the manga and the second anime because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's a living, immortal Philosopher's stone, and probably doesn't actually exist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndeadTaxExemption">in any official records</a>, and he was trying to keep his sons from being associated with him to keep them away from Father, who would want to use them in his plot</span>. <br/>Similarly, the first anime version <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is a near-immortal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surfer</a> with a jealous and centuries-old ex-lover/ex-wife looking for him, who probably wouldn't have the best intentions in mind for his new family. His latest body may or may not have had its own name and proper records, but Van Hohenheim for whatever reason didn't want to use them if it did, likely to not take any kinds of risks. (And considering that Dante later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFatherLoveSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveFatherLoveSon">wanted Ed to be her "consort"</a> once her plan to hijack Rose's body was complete, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama">with or without his consent</a>, he had quite the point.)</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendofArslan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeroicLegendofArslan">Prince Arslan</a> was roundly denounced by his detractors as not being of royal blood, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which turns out to be true in the novels and the manga, as Queen Tahmine confessed that he was the son of one of their royal cavalry and a serving girl,</span> but quickly proves to his devoted companions and several nobles that he is charismatic, kind, and intelligent enough to make a great ruler regardless. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterMagneticTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterMagneticTeam">knack for attracting high-class and devoted followers</a> definitely doesn't hurt either.
</li><li> Serpico from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is the illegitimate son of a powerful merchant born from an affair with a maid. He's also one of the few genuinely good characters in the series, as he cares for his legitimate sister Farnese and protects the weak.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Takuto Tsunashi</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StarDriver">Star Driver</a></em>.

Pretty late in the series it is revealed by the Elves that he never had a proper father. Just to clear up facts, he is a (almost) complete asshat, so the title was fitting way before that reveal.
</li><li> Touma H. Norstein of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em>. Like in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille">Ratatouille</a></em>, it's never stated outright because this is a kid's show, but the implication is that he's the son of an Austrian aristocrat and a Japanese exchange student who never married. He's a nice guy if a little cold at first, but he suffered due to his illegitimacy, as his grandmother told him to his face (right after his mother died!) that he was a member of the great Norstein family, yet he wasn't.
</li><li> Future Trunks from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>. He states clearly to Goku upon their first meeting that Bulma and Vegeta never got married because the former did not want to. Main-timeline Trunks was as well, though his parents do eventually marry.

His mother Yukino is a former model who got knocked up by an extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">wealthy man</a> and quit her career to have him. This results in heavy resentment from her towards him, and strong and complicated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OedipusComplex">love/hate</a> feelings from him towards her, also affecting his relationship with Yukari.

<ul><li> In the anime, Rei was going to be adopted properly into the family and Fukiko was fine with it; the reason she wasn't is because she and Fukiko made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidePact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicidePact">suicide pact</a> but Fukiko chickened out in the middle of it, so it appeared Rei had tried to kill herself out of the pressures of joining the family and so the adoption was cancelled.

His birth father's family greatly scorned him, especially when it turned out he had magic that he couldn't control very well. While he could have grown up into a shameless playboy to cope with loneliness, Catarina made sure to make friends with him when they were little and he ends up growing into a very calm, responsible, and elegant young man worthy of his position as the heir of the Claes duchy. And since he was adopted to become the new Claes heir, his bastardy is largely irrelevant. Note that in the original timeline, one of the reasons he was so lonely was because Catarina's mother thought he was her husband's bastard, and treated him horribly. In the new timeline, she ends up confronting her husband about it almost immediately, discovers the truth, and has a good long talk about their relationship. They become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SickeninglySweethearts">Sickeningly Sweethearts</a> after that, and the Claes family grows up happily, giving Keith a stable home after spending his formative years in an abusive household.

<ul><li> Hercules, Perseus, Ramma, Sigurd, Apollo, Artemis. In fact, the whole of the Heroic Age in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> was basically about a bunch of heroes ("hero" coming from an ancient Greek word that was basically a synonym for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemiDivine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemiDivine">demigod</a>") who were mostly badass extramarital children of Olympian gods (first of all, Zeus), making them the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of Heroic Bastard (both in academic sense and often personality-wise).
</li><li> A startlingly large number of the protagonists in classic Arthurian myth are illegitimate, to wit:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> himself was born of a deception when Merlin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">disguised Uther Pendragon as Gorlois</a> so Uther could sleep with Gorlois' wife, Igraine. Uther and Igraine did get married before Arthur was born, so he is not of illegitimate birth, just illegitimate conception, so technically qualifies.
</li><li> Merlin was said to be the child of a human woman and an incubus. It doesn't seem likely that they were married.
</li><li> The "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">perfect gentle knight"</a> Galahad, one of the Grail-finders, was the bastard son of Lancelot and Elaine.
</li><li> Mordred is usually the son of Arthur and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">half-sister Morgause</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMistsOfAvalon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMistsOfAvalon">Morgaine</a>). While many of the older versions of Arthurian myth paint Mordred as a typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BastardBastard">double-bastard</a> (evil as well as illegitimate), more recent works (and even some of the older ones) have tried to reform this character, at least so that he's more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">Fallen Hero</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicVillain">Tragic Villain</a> who is utterly broken at the revelation.
</li><li> Perceval, in the versions where he's Pellinore's son. And that's just the major characters. To this add Sir Tor (one of the knights of the white hart), Guinglain (Gawaine's long-lost son), Yvain the Bastard (so called to distinguish him from his half-brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">also named Yvain</a>), and Sagramore in many of his Hungarian incarnations, plus at least two other bastard sons of Arthur (Logors and Arthur the less) and anyone that has slipped this troper's mind. As the majority of the fathers in these cases were major knights themselves, the original ballad writers were apparently more concerned with the genealogy than they were the marriage vows.

Since he's serving Gustavus Adolphus, one of the few "good" monarchs of that time period, and is visibly disgusted at atrocities committed by German soldiers, he's probably Heroic even before the arrival of Grantville.
</li><li> Aeneas in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAeneid">The Aeneid</a>.</em> He's the illegitimate son of the goddess Aphrodite/Venus and the mortal Anchises.

Since he is a fearsome fighter, however, the only people who mention this are relatives (local traditions disapprove of shedding the blood of kinsfolk), idiots, and people a safe distance away.
<ul><li> In the sequel, king Urgit of Cthol Murgos is revealed to be one, as Silk's late father found the Murgo nobility's custom of sequestering their women nothing but an inviting challenge. The result is actually a benefit to Urgit (and by extension, his kingdom) as he's spared from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">hereditary insanity plaguing the royal bloodline</a> (as well as giving him enough cunning to win the deadly succession war). It also saves him from Mallorean Emperor Zakath having him horribly killed as part of his (Zakath's) methodical revenge extermination of the Urga bloodline. After some king-coaching from Garion, Urgit goes on to be a fairly decent king.

Records are kept of when such a liaison produces a child - a birth certificate includes maternal ancestry and may have notes such as "Great-grandchild of Kei Whistler and Order of the Sword crib captive Gerard, #458". The current generation of Whistlers had married parents and grandparents, but it's well established that those grandmothers whose children ended up so respectable were roguish.
</li><li> Besma bint Abdul in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caliphate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Caliphate">Caliphate</a></em> is the daughter of a rich merchant and his concubine, and she is probably the kindest, decent, most generous character in the book. Unlike many examples of this trope, she was raised by her father and is considered his favorite child unlike Besma's half-brother Fundail, who is actually legitimate and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">real little monster</a>.

He also happens to be illegitimate (his mother refused to marry his father because "he could produce no more than seventy-one quarterings in his arms"). Despite how little legitimacy matters to the events of the book, Cunegonde's brother refuses to allow her to marry so far below her. He never lets up on this tiring belief, even after Candide bought him out of slavery.

He is the bastard son of Earl Fitzherbert, known as "Fitz", and his housekeeper (who in short order becomes his former housekeeper) Ethel Williams (who raises Lloyd). In the second book of the trilogy, "Winter of the World", he becomes a tireless crusader against fascism, fighting first the British Union of Fascists in the East End of London, then going to Spain to fight in the Civil War, and finally fighting Nazi Germany in World War II.

However it is widely rumored that he is actually illegetimate since the queen wasn't very faithful to her husband. The fact that, unlike his brother, Nikolai doesn't look anything like the king certainly doesn't help either. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His mother eventually tells him that he was indeed born from an affair she had with Magnus Opjer.

(At one point Ward introduces him as "cousin", in the correct assumption that everyone will assume he's one of the many bastards Ward's father fathered.) There's also Stala, Ward's half-aunt. She's a bastard from his mother's side of the family. The king has a bastard half-brother, who is much more heroic than he.

</li><li> The main character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>, Eragon, is one, the son of Selena and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Brom</span>. One could argue that this applies to all Elves, as they don't marry. However, as a result, they don't even really have the concept of "legitimacy" and view it as a pretty silly human notion. Eragon angsts a bit over this after he first hears it, but he's told that his parents considered themselves married, assuaging this a bit.

</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neogicia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neogicia">Neogicia</a></em>. The female protagonist Saly develops unusual powers after her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">Bio-Augmentation</a> into a neomancer and Emperor Keynn Lucans sponsors her into a prestigious neomancer school. Keynn's involvement is kept as discrete as possible, but a teacher that does not like Saly very much eventually mentions Keynn keeping an eye on her out loud in a crowded classroom. Thanks to Keynn notoriously not having a family and privately being in no hurry to start one thanks to being in a quasi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause">Immortal Procreation Clause</a> situation (he's physically in his mid-thirties at ten centuries old), rumors of Saly being either his bastard daughter or pregnant with his illegitimate child quickly emerge.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">Zig-zagged</a> by the main character of Kate Thompson's fantasy novel <em>The New Policeman</em>, who is a teenager who is teased by his fellow students because his parents were never married and he has his mother's name. However, his parents are actually a stable and loving couple who have lived together since before he was born, run a farm together, and have two children, and they decided not to get married <em>explicitly so</em> her children would be guaranteed to keep her last name. So from his point of view, he's not a bastard—but from the point of view of several people in his community, he is, since, despite his parents having a rock-solid long-term relationship, they were never formally married and thus that technically makes him a bastard.
</li><li> Both Cat and Bones from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightHuntress">Night Huntress</a></em> series. Cat is the product of rape, and she and her mother are both shunned by their small town for her out-of-wedlock birth. Bones is both a bastard and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SonOfAWhore">Son of a Whore</a>.

</li><li> Lirael of the Clayr, although not technically illegitimate since the Clayr don't typically marry, has to deal with very similar social disapproval because her mother ran off mysteriously (against tradition) and returned pregnant with Lirael, and completely refused to speak of the identity of Lirael's father. The odd circumstances of Lirael's birth, combined with her non-Clayr looks and lack of Clayr gifts, all cause her to be treated by some as an awkward "love child" rather than a "true daughter of the Clayr". Using her Remembrancer powers she at one point looks into the past and sees her mother and father meet, confirming her worst fears that she was conceived as a one night stand, and stops the vision before she can see her own conception. It's only much later that she finds out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her father is Terciel, the former Abhorsen, which not only makes her the heir to the title but also Sabriel's half-sister, and it's the Abhorsen looks that she inherited</span>.

Though Rognvald does not deny Einar, he makes clear that he does not care for him and considers him an unworthy offspring on account of his mother's low status. Nevertheless, Einar frees Orkney from the Vikings that have occupied it, proves to be a capable ruler, and when Rognvald is treacherously killed, ironically Einar is the son who avenges him.
</li><li> All of the Demigods (also known as half-bloods) from Rick Riordan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonAndTheOlympians">Percy Jackson and the Olympians</a></em> series, since the Greek gods have not changed their habits from ancient times and leave plenty of illegitimate children around.

In fact due to the widespread nature of this trope, the only heroes in the universe that <em>aren't</em> this trope are the main protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKaneChronicles">The Kane Chronicles</a></em>, and a few non-demigod main characters like Rachael and Hearthstone (of course having married parents doesn't mean the latter two had happier home lives, and the Kane Chronicles protagonists had parent absences due to death and legal custody fights).

He also develops into the other type of bastard, the literal meaning already applicable since the Empress had never married his father:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sgt. Catrone:</strong> Order received and understood, and I will comply. You bastard. <br/><strong>Prince Roger:</strong> That I am. Literally and figuratively. The last bastard standing. The flag of the <em>Basik's</em> Own wears a bar sinister proudly.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRiftwarCycle">The Riftwar Cycle</a></em> has a couple:
<ul><li> Martin Longbow is a bastard child of Duke Borric of Crydee and a serving girl. This poses a problem after his father, on his deathbed, legitimizes him as his son. Since he's the oldest of Borric's children, this puts him first in line for the throne of the kingdom itself. Thankfully for the kingdom, he surrenders his claim to that throne in favor of his younger half-brother Liam and ends up as the next Duke of Crydee.
</li><li> Eric von Darkmoor is the bastard (although his mother tried to claim that he was legitimate and that his father's relatives annulled the marriage in order to get the Baron-to-be to marry another noble for an alliance) son of the Baron von Darkmoor. He is a much better person than the eldest legitimate child of his father.
</li></ul></li><li> Bane the Bastard in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rigante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Rigante">Rigante</a></em> series, the illegitimate son of King Connavar.

This gives him an interesting place in society (that society being France on the eve of the Revolution), with one foot in the world of his noble foster father and one foot in the common world of his presumed mother. It also allows for a dramatic revelation about his real parentage at the climax.
</li><li> Pearl Prynne, the illegitimate child of Hester Prynne, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheScarletLetter">The Scarlet Letter</a></em> by Nathaniel Hawthorne, is a slightly revised version of the "illegitimacy means evil child" notion. Because the entire book is about the rebounding effects of denying and admitting sin, Pearl is seen as a living embodiment of the scarlet letter A worn on Hester's chest. Pearl is irreverent, impish, and obsessed with the scarlet letter, and a source of much anguish to her mother, until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her father admits to being Hester's lover and fellow-sinner. After this, Pearl's character changes completely — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">one might say she becomes a "normal" little girl</a>.</span>

</li><li> The titular hero in Bernard Cornwell's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Sharpe">Sharpe</a></em> series is the son of a prostitute and an unknown man.

</li><li> George R.R. Martin's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> has bastard children of all sorts with a wide variety of temperaments. The most notable and heroic is Jon Snow, the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, and is one of the characters in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">series' world</a> most befitting a classic hero — also described as a <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/yarEbKyk8PU?t=146">"classic hero"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">author, George R. R. Martin</a>. While Jon is raised by his father alongside his trueborn siblings as part of the family in his father's home castle, loves and is loved by his father and siblings, Jon still feels like somewhat of an outsider in his own family. He chooses to join the Night's Watch to earn his own honour. It is possible that his half-brother, Robb, with whom he was very close, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> officially legitimized Jon as a Stark in his will and named Jon as heir, as he talked to his mother of doing</span>, but Jon does not know this yet. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is a popular fandom theory that Jon is not Eddard's biological son, but his nephew, as Jon may be the son of Eddard's sister Lyanna Stark and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Prince Rhaegar Targaryen</a>, both deceased.

<ul><li> King Robert Baratheon's bastard children come across as quite heroic if sharing the Baratheon stubbornness. Gendry is quite decent and selfless, joining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Brotherhood</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">without Banners</a> as he likes their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless">ideals</a>.

</li><li> Ser Rolland Storm, the Bastard of Nightsong, is a relatively minor character but comes across as quite decent. When King Stannis Baratheon is losing the war and surrounded by various scheming and ambitious nobles, he mentions Rolland is one of the few good men left to him. Rolland helps Davos Seaworth send Edric to safety and is left by Stannis to hold Dragonstone when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sails to the Wall, refusing to surrender even to vastly superior odds.</span>
</li><li> "The World of Ice and Fire" writes of Benedict Rivers, a bastard of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudingFamilies">Feuding Families</a> Blackwood and Bracken. He is despised for his parentage, however, he's such a great warrior that he is able to become the first man to unite the Riverlands, and takes the name Justman, creating a Royal House that rules the Riverlands for almost three centuries.
</li><li> The bastards Addam of Hull and Alyn, apparently bastards of the deceased Laenor Velaryon (or, more likely, Laenor's father Lord Corlys Velaryon, who didn't want his wife to be offended), who are legitimized at the request of their "grandfather", becoming heirs to Driftmark. Despite Rhaenyra taking the actions of two other dragonseed, the Two Betrayers, as proof bastards are treacherous, forcing Addam to flee, Addam heroically gathers an army to fight Rhaenyra's enemies, dying in the process. His brother succeeds Corlys as Lord of Driftmark and becomes known as Oakenfist for his naval victories.
</li><li> Played with on Brynden Rivers "Bloodraven", one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">Aegon IV's</a> "The Unworthy" many bastards.

However, his methods may have been necessary, considering the very real threat the Blackfyres posed. Eventually, Brynden's extreme actions, murdering one of Daemon's sons despite an offer of safe conduct, forced Daeron's grandson Aegon V to send him into exile. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Currently it's unclear whether Bloodraven is working with the Others or against them.</span>
</li><li> In "The Tales of Dunk and Egg", Egg <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Prince Aegon</span>, while talking about the Blackfyres and Bloodraven, claims bastards are treacherous by nature. Dunk (Ser Duncan the Tall) points out that he is probably a bastard, as he doesn't know who his parents are. Dunk is one of the few figures in the series who lives up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmour">Knight In Shining Armour</a> ideal.
</li><li> Ser Glendon "Flowers" (who insists he is Glendon Ball) plays with this. He claims to be the son of Quentyn Ball "Fireball" (considering his mother was a camp follower who slept with a lot of men around that time this is dubious) and at first comes across as a jerk to Dunk for his support of the Blackfyres. However he turns out to be a very good jouster and closer to the knightly ideal than many of the knights at a Tourney, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who were being bribed to lose to Daemon II Blackfyre</span>.

Still, he is always conscious of being a bastard, which means he will get no inheritance and must make his own way in life. He can at any moment hear nasty insults because of his being a bastard (in one case he fights with one of the insulted and knocks out to of his teeth). Above all, he is tormented by not knowing who his mother was - his father refuses to tell him, and others don't know. Only at the very end of the book does he find out that his mother had always been there, she was a woman he knew since childhood, and with whom he always had very ambiguous relations. Unfortunately, just before he found that she was his mother he had a very nasty quarrel and drove her away, and he would never find her again.
