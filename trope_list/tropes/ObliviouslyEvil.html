These villains aren't justifying their wrongdoings. They aren't compelled by unnatural forces. They just don't comprehend that they're doing anything wrong. This can be achieved in several ways:
</p><p></p><ul><li> They might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">mistake morality for black and white extremes</a>.
</li><li> Their perceptions could be tainted with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>.
</li><li> Their minds could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingTorturedMakesYouEvil">broken by torture</a>.
</li><li> They could have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">legitimate but completely alien value system</a> and by that system what they are doing <em>is</em> good.
</li><li> They could just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid">be too stupid</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroublingUnchildlikeBehavior">or too young</a> to understand that there are consequences for their acts.
</li><li> They might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe">too selfish and self-absorbed</a> to understand they're hurting people.
</li><li> They are being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePawn">deceived by someone else</a>.
</li><li> They have animal-level intelligence and are acting out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">instinct, not malice</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><li> They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">outsourced their morality to their master</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindObedience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindObedience">as long as their master likes it then it's right for them</a>.
</li><li> They may not be privy to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> and thus not know their actions are causing damage.
</li><li> They will be confused or annoyed at any explanation that what they're doing is wrong, and react with confusion or disdain if the heroes disagree with them.
</li><li> Their victims are so fundamentally different, that the "villain" is honestly unaware of or even incapable of acknowledging their existence (or at least that they're sentient and hurting), and the victims cannot communicate their plight to them.
</li></ul><p>There are two basic requirements for a character to be this trope:
</p><ol><li> They are effective. The character is quite capable of causing tyranny, tragedy, chaos, wanton destruction, etc. Contrast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionWithAnFInEvil">Minion with an F in Evil</a>, who represent relatively minor threats to the protagonists.
</li><li> They have no idea that they're doing <em>anything</em> objectionable. In their eyes, their actions are either good or simply harmless. Even if they recognize that something is wrong, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">they won't realize that they are the problem</a>. For example, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexIsEvilAndIAmHorny">Sex Is Evil, and I Am Horny</a> character might sexually assault women and feel as if he's <em>their</em> victim.

It may place the heroes into a situation where they can't even try to reason with the villain. It can also be used to underscore that the villain is indeed a tragic figure, as he or she or it may never have actually intended to harm anyone. Alternately, this can be used to make a creature sympathetic. You give it a valid reason for doing the things it does, and once it has that reason, it won't see what it's doing as wrong.
</p><p>Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> are like this. They just wanted to build a nest and get some lunch, but they stumbled across countless strange structures and were suddenly under attack by tiny bipedal creatures.

Such a character may qualify as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonMaliciousMonster">Non-Malicious Monster</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreCthulhu">Humans Are Cthulhu</a>.

All throughout the film, he never even once considers that he's in the wrong and genuinely seems to believe that he's acting by the will of God.

<ul><li> Victarion Greyjoy is by no means a malicious man, and is certainly no moustache-twirling villain. In many ways, he's actually quite admirable and straightforward. However, he wholeheartedly believes in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ARealManIsAKiller">warped</a> values of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">the culture he was raised in</a>, and is too <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">lacking in imagination, intelligence, and self-awareness</a> to question them, let alone work around any existing loopholes for moral purposes. Or to work out when he's completely flunked Comparative Religion 101, for that matter.
</li><li> Brandon Stark unwittingly breaks almost every skinchanging taboo still remembered north of the Wall — all of which are in place to avoid people like him and Varamyr Sixskins misusing their power by abusing not just other people, but the beasts used as hosts, as well. Unlike with Varamyr, who knowingly becomes reviled and feared for theatrically chucking the rulebook into a metaphorical shredder, it's not exactly Bran's fault: <em>nobody has ever taught him that rules even exist</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Worse, what few teachers he has may even be deliberately misleading him.</span>
</li><li> Robert Arryn is in the same boat as Bran: too young to realise that what he's doing is downright hideous. Calling for and then watching executions isn't supposed to be fun for small kids, but you try telling him and his mother that.
</li><li> Crown Prince (and later King) Joffrey Baratheon does usually have some idea when what he's doing is considered bad by other people around him — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">watching their impotent rage is one reason why he enjoys being a outright prick to others,</a> after all. The thing is, he often really doesn't comprehend the multiple reasons <em>why</em> people would take issue in the first place, both because he's not all that bright or well-educated and because he's been raised to see whatever he does to be actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralMyopia">OK if he's the one doing it,</a> since he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">outranked almost everybody around him for his whole life.</a> And, even if he doesn't outrank everybody all the time, it's still OK...if those very select few don't ever find out! (Which they <em>mostly</em> do — not that he thinks that far ahead.) Worse, many at Court have routinely covered for him when things have gone badly wrong, so he's not fully aware of how knock-on effects or direct consequences can affect him and others around him, too (and how that is not a good thing). He genuinely struggles to understand moral concepts more complex than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIMakeThem">"Because I Said So",</a> and usually fails to. His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">Stupid Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid">Lethally Stupid</a> acts have all of their roots solidly in this trope. Keep in mind that he's only about thirteen years old with a neglectful home life and a poor genetic hand (unsurprisingly. Cersei is to blame for both). He still is a prime example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">an evil little monster</a> to deal with, however.
</li><li> Ask yourself this: in a world with things like psychiatric evaluations and antipsychotic medication (things Westeros could do with, frankly), would Aerys II "The Mad" Targaryen ever have become the paranoid pyromaniac who thought murdering two Starks and requesting the head of a third with a side order of a Baratheon would solve things? If the answer is "no", then most of his atrocities would have to live here, on the grounds that Captain Reason was not at the helm of his ship a lot of the time.
</li><li> Daenerys Targaryen means well enough and isn't a dunce, but when trying to Do Good in politics, she messes up. Badly. The decent, well-rounded and unbiased education she needed, but was actively denied by her unconventional upbringing and abusive brother... might have saved <em>a lot</em> of lives had she ever got it <em>before</em> she tried being a teen queen. Some of what she does goes so badly wrong, it hovers between this and the slightly more benign <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteTheRightThing">Not Quite the Right Thing</a>.

</li><li> Dolphins are depicted similarly (and, in fact, the Howler mindset is directly compared to theirs), which means that this trope applies to <em>them</em> as well (at least in the Animorphs universe). This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, probably, as dolphins have been observed killing porpoises for fun.

They are portrayed, to some extent, as almost sympathetically dumb and not terribly malicious, and yet they are fond of inflicting gruesome, senseless violence for no reason. It seems to be a product of their living environment, the deep, world-encompassing caves that cause peculiar Lamarckian mutations to their inhabitants; humans who colonize these areas quickly either die or assume aspects of the Hadal way of life, including casual cannibalism and sadism towards outsiders. The Hadals have been known to initiate surface humans to their society as a gesture of goodwill, or to replenish their numbers — this involves months of gruesome mutilation and rape.

As Susan Sto-Helit says when confronting him, "You were the little boy who didn't know the difference between throwing a stone at a cat and setting a cat on fire." Teatime is only an apprentice assassin. Not because he can't perform well, but because he is known within the Assassin's Guild for <em>lack of elegance</em> on his assignments, which, in his case, means not only killing the target but nailing the target's head to the wall and killing his family, servants, and household pets on the way out for fun. Oddly enough, he actually likes animals—he just doesn't think of drugging a guard dog instead of nailing it to the ceiling.

Elijah uses this to point out how robots could be used to commit murder by performing tasks that they have been led to believe are harmless, giving the example of getting one robot to poison a glass of milk (telling it that the milk will be poured out and not given to a person), and then having a second robot (who doesn't know the milk is poisoned) give the victim the poisoned glass.

<ul><li> One killer was hallucinating that he was in a war zone and that his victims were members of the opposing army. In actuality, he was running around construction sites and his victims were innocent bystanders. In fact, a number of killers fit this trope by virtue of being insane or mentally disabled. Another good example is one murderer who committed all his crimes while in a state of psychosis, then couldn't remember them afterwards. He was absolutely horrified when he found out what he'd done.
</li><li> Another good example would be Samantha Malcolm of the season 5 episode "The Uncanny Valley". Mentally unbalanced after prolonged sexual abuse by her father - and countless rounds of electroshock he subjected her to so she'd never rat him out - Samantha only wants to recreate the dolls she loved as a child. Unfortunately, she does this by abducting women, keeping them paralyzed with a cocktail of drugs, and sewing them into dresses and wigs to resemble her beloved toys. She has no real idea that what she's doing is wrong, and Reid points out that her intention isn't to kill the women she takes, to the point where she actually takes relatively good care of them. She just keeps them paralyzed for so long they eventually die of overdoses.
</li></ul></li><li> Most killers from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSI">CSI</a></em> qualify.

<ul><li> Interestingly, it's often proven after the fact that Cameron made the right call. For example, Sarah is horrified when Cameron kills Enrique just because he <em>might</em> have been an informant, but a message left on Ellison's answering machine reveals that he was indeed an informant, and he was about to reveal the Connors' location to the FBI.

<ul><li> Some followers/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">demons</a> of Nurgle are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffablyEvil">very happy</a> and just want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndCallHimGeorge">hug others</a> and make them a part of the family of grandfather Nurgle. They don't get why being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">rotting zombies with gaping weeping sores</a> (among other things) isn't desirable to others. Nurgle is, quite literally, likened to a jovial grandfather. He's easily the nicest of the Chaos gods.
<ul><li> This side of Nurgle is emphasized by his daemonic beasts, giant plague-ridden, acid-oozing slug-creatures called the Beasts of Nurgle; they're killing machines with the minds of playful, friendly puppies, who don't realise why their "playmates" become so dull and silent after a short hug. One of the more recent additions to the daemonic arsenal is the Rot Fly; the grown up form a Beast of Nurgle assumes once its perpetual bafflement gives way to resentment of the way that mortals won't play with them, becoming malevolent, flesh-eating fly-monsters.
</li></ul></li><li> Then there's the arguable case of the Thousand Sons, who received so many "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">gifts</a>" from their patron god Tzeentch that they were beginning to turn from gene-boosted human sorcerers to gibbering monstrosities. Arguable because whilst the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">denizens of the Warp</a> often appear genuinely clueless about the limitations of the mortal physique, assuming that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">Tzeentch</a> acts out of ignorance is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">seldom a wise move</a>.
</li><li> There's also the Orks, who fight, maim, and kill their way across the universe because... it's fun. And it's what they were made to do. And all the other Orks are doing it. And it just feels <em>right</em>. They also have absolutely no fear of death, and consider a good enemy who can provide a hard fight to be a resource worth cultivating and releasing if captured; the Orkish word for such an individual is <em>Grod</em>, which roughly translates as best friend or favourite enemy.
</li><li> This is apparently standard attitude for the Imperium, as in one <em>Last Chancers</em> novel one of the title Penal Legion actually thinks that xenophobia towards humans isn't a very good reason for wanting to start a fight with a human, apparently forgetting the fact that the Imperium pillages and slaughters any alien species they come across, more often than not pursuing the race to extinction or very close to it.
</li><li> Ogryns are a species of abhumans who are as stupid and childlike as they are huge, displaying absolute faith in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> that gets them held as an example. Getting them to side with Chaos involves less tempting and corrupting them as it does simply getting a superior telling them the Emperor is angry with the loyalists.
</li><li> Solidly Averted by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">Inquisition</a>. Inquisitors are all too aware that the wholesale slaughter of species who don't even have a concept of space more than ancient cavemen, monsters that very much deserve to be killed like the forces of Chaos and some Xenos species and even fellow humans who are endangering Imperial order and military logistics by rebellion or noncompliance (for example, over the fact that they may be starving or being worked to death) is a grim necessity. Though the occasional delusional maniac can be found as well, subjecting people what other Inquisitors would just put a lasbolt to the back of the head to horrible tortures to get a confession of heresy out of them, when the person was still worshipping the Imperial Cult and just wanted more food for their family.

As an example, making a video to give Lisa as a birthday present, but not recalling anything about her. Not even the stuff that should be obvious, like the fact that she is a vegetarian. The video turns out to be just tear-jerkingly, rage-inducingly insulting to her.

SpongeBob doesn't mean to hurt or annoy Squidward or drive him insane, all he wants is to make him happy and have fun. Patrick's just too stupid to know any better. Mr. Krabs, while usually just flat-out evil when not falling victim to Plankton, does genuinely seem to believe that his greed helps his business. Best illustrated in "The Krabby Kronicles" when he responds to SpongeBob's concern about their tabloid newspaper:

She protests and questions why she was transferred, unaware that throughout the three episodes, she was pretty much a villain. Her overall bossiness, planning to eliminate Zoey behind her back, and using an injured Sam as a human shield. In fact, throughout the series, Courtney is the only antagonist (or antagonistic character like Duncan and Eva) who is oblivious that she is a jerk towards everyone and still thinks everyone loves her.
