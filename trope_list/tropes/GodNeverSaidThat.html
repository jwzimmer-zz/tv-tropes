</div></div><p>When there are important gaps in a work's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a>, there are a few ways that they can be filled in (short of within the work proper, which would just be additional Canon):
</p><p></p><ul><li> Sometimes, creators say stuff about important gaps in canon. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>.
<ul><li> If they wind up changing their mind afterwards, Word of God turns into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">Flip-Flop of God</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Sometimes, people close to the creator say stuff about important gaps in the canon. That's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Word of Saint Paul</a>.
</li><li> If Word of neither God nor Saint Paul is available, fans will often make stuff up themselves to fill in important gaps in canon. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>.
<ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><li> Sometimes, Fanon ends up being taken as the next best thing to canon, at which point it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">Word of Dante</a>.
</li><li> Sometimes, Fanon gets imported right back into the original canon. Unsurprisingly, that's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanon">Ascended Fanon</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">And sometimes</a>, people just make stuff up, and falsely attribute it to the creators or the original canon (sometimes unintentionally). Many who hear this type of information don't usually realize that God Never Said That.
</li></ul><p>This is about that last one (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontExplainTheJoke">in case you couldn't tell from the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Title Drop</a>).

God Never Said That differs from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Beam Me Up, Scotty!</a> in that that trope is about things not said or done by the <em>characters</em>.

Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">Urban Legends</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCultureUrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopCultureUrbanLegends">Pop Culture Urban Legends</a>, which propagate themselves by similar means.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> A mistranslation of a line in the episode "Bye Bye Butterfree" led to the mistaken belief that it was canon that Butterfree die after they mate.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2008/07/second-pokemon-interview-with-masamitsu-hidaka-many-interesting-points">In an interview in 2008<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Masamitsu Hidaka stated that when Ash Ketchum becomes a Pokémon Master, the show will end. Many fans took that to mean that Ash will never win a Pokémon League because if he wins, he would be a Pokémon Master. Never mind the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToBeAMaster">the goal of Pokémon Master</a> is deliberately vague, with Ash himself saying that winning a League is just a small step to that goal and that being a Pokémon Master is greater than simply being the world's strongest Pokémon Trainer. This misconception has become so notorious that <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em> director <a class="urllink" href="https://cho-animedia.jp/anime/107460/">Daiki Tomiyasu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had to address the issue by saying that a Pokémon Master is not just winning the League and that <em>learning</em> is more important over winning or losing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amusingly, Tomiyasu had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenWinLossStreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenWinLossStreak">Ash win his first Pokémon League and become the Champion</a>, as if to hammer in that fact once and for all</span>.
</li><li> This is also stated that <em>Pokémon Sun &amp; Moon</em> was non-canon to the anime timeline according to a Twitter post written by the sound director. However, that was a mistranslation because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said that, after returning from Kalos, Ash spent three weeks at home before going to Alola.
</li><li> Despite fans saying someone confirmed it, it has not been confirmed that Verity from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonIChooseYou">Pokémon: I Choose You!</a></em> is the daughter of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cynthia</span>. Her mother is a powerful trainer from Sinnoh who looks like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cynthia</span>, but the director has stated that they're not the same character.
</li></ul></li><li> For years, fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em> used Tomino saying that "for people like Katejina, death is the easy way out" to illustrate just how evil she was. In fact, Tomino never said this. The actual quote was that he "wanted to give Katejina a punishment heavier than death", and even <em>this</em> was a misquote from <a class="urllink" href="https://wavemotioncannon.com/2016/11/08/interview-hideaki-anno-vs-yoshiyuki-tomino-animage-071994/">this interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, where the actual quote is that he wanted to give her a punishment heavier than the <em>blindness</em> that was ultimately decided upon. Tomino pitied Katejina, and insisted that though he was obligated to punish her at the end, he wanted to leave her alive so that she has the chance to work hard to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">atone for her evil deeds</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">earn her happy ending eventually.</a> Basically, Tomino's stance on Katejina's fate shows that he believes she <em>is</em> redeemable, rather than the opposite.
</li><li> This was pretty common during the airing of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>:
<ul><li> An interview from director Mitsuo Fukuda was altered, leaving many a fan to think that he actually believed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMessiah">Chairman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Durandal</a></span> was right for his actions in the last episodes.
</li><li> Another was <em>SEED Destiny</em>'s infamous interview with screenwriter Chiaki Morosawa, which was also a fake. Thankfully, this was caught by a forum administrator when they looked for the original article.
</li></ul></li><li> Happens quite a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, partially thanks to its age and its copious amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">Fanon</a>. Four of the most common "falsely canonical" statements are:
<ul><li> "The Jusenkyo Guide took Ranma and Genma to Joketsuzoku to investigate a cure": He didn't. No reason why he took them there is ever given, though the fact that the two are in China to train and the fact that the village is full of martial artists, plus the fact he <em>is</em> doing the tour-guide routine when they reach the place, may indicate he took them there per request after Jusenkyo turned out to be such a flop for training.
</li><li> "Happosai/Nabiki is a total villain": <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RumikoTakahashi">Rumiko Takahashi</a> has never said anything about their villain status; the most that happened was that she once reported in an interview that being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">Karma Houdini</a> is what makes Nabiki funny and has called her nothing more than "a greedy girl with an impure heart". She also thrice drew non-canonical pieces of artwork showing Nabiki in a stereotypical "devil suit".
</li><li> "There is no cure for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Jusenkyo</a>": Takahashi has, in fact, stated that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">water of Nanniichuan</a> will undo a Jusenkyo curse for Ranma or any of the other cursed men, and showed a temporary version of Nanniichuan curing him and Genma for its duration. This likely came from the fact that nobody ever managed to get their hands on Nanniichuan water and use it (which can actually be explained quite easily as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>), and the fact a minor villain managed to use Jusenkyo to create a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MixAndMatchCritters">Mix-and-Match Critters</a> curse (though he was one to begin with).
</li><li> "Ranma accepts being trans/genderfluid": A popular scanlation penned by well-known Western H-fanartists replaced Ranma's dialogue after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> to say that "[his] girl side was a part of [him], and it wasn't a curse after all." Which has been used as ultimate evidence of Ranma's feelings about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">his curse</a>. While there <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">characterization elsewhere in the manga to support such interpretations</a>, Ranma never said that particular line. In both the original Japanese and the official translations, Ranma is merely musing to himself that, with Akane's life on the line, trying to get a cure for himself didn't matter anymore. But he's still jumping at the chance to cure his curse in the very next scene. Why the scanlators decided to invent dialogue wholesale, leading to fanon that persists over a decade later and has supplanted the official release, is anyone's guess.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> There's a rumor in the fandom that not only did the couples of Ken/Miyako and Yamato/Sora end up married, but they originally slated Mimi/Koushiro and Takeru/Hikari for marriage as well. Since the ending was ambiguous many fans like to make that as an excuse to ship them stating that "technically, they got married". In fact the rumor was started by a fansite, and since every single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> extra material has been leaked in every possible place and nobody can get a copy of the "interview" saying so, it's most likely false. (Especially since Mimi/Koushiro is particularly illogical given that the most screen time they had within four feet of each other was in only one minor episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> until <em>Digimon Tri</em> came out and gave them more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a>.</span>)
</li><li> Another bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a> is that Yamato and Sora were divorced. Many a fan were certain they'd heard it mentioned on the original episode, but the facts turned out to be false. While there is no evidence that Yamato and Sora were ever married, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantFinale">Distant Finale</a> of <em>Adventure 02</em> claims that Ken and Miyako <em>did</em> wind up being married. Thus the idea that Ken/Miyako was never stated to happen ended up being false, instead of the idea of their eventual marriage being false.
</li><li> It's sometimes said that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTamers">Digimon Tamers</a></em> was explicitly said to <em>not</em> be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">its sequel</a>... except the only thing Konaka actually said on the subject was that he wasn't going to tie the two continuities together or have characters from <em>Adventure</em> interact with the <em>Tamers</em> characters for the sake of fanservice. Further materials released after <em>Tamers</em> actually go as far to imply that it <em>was</em>, after all, <em>Adventure</em> and <em>Adventure 02</em>.
</li><li> Another <em>Tamers</em> tidbit is the fact that certain fans tend to take the interpretation of Digimon "biology" and generalize it to other seasons, specifically things like "Digimon have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBiologicalSex">No Biological Sex</a>". <em>Tamers</em> has no such sway over any other Digimon universe.
</li><li> Certain events in 02 have led the fans to believe that it is impossible for Digimon who die in the real world to be reborn in the standard way, but this has never actually been declared or established. While it's perfectly legitimate to infer such a thing, it's not the hard-and-fast rule that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a> thinks it is.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Until <em>Digimon Tri</em> came out and confirmed this theory in its fourth movie.</span>)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EiichiroOda">Eiichiro Oda</a> is frequently claimed by fans to have said a great many things that he never actually said. He really does give regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> answers to fan questions, but not in a language that most English-speaking fans can read, but even if he they could, some of his answers are crazy even by <em>One Piece</em> standards. Some of them are clearly jokes (for example, claiming that Chopper eating four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyUpgrade">Rumble Balls</a> within six hours results in <em>Oda</em> turning into an uncontrollable monster), but sometimes it's impossible to tell.
</li><li> Once, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a> posted an interview on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/FourChan">4chan</a>, supposedly by the director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, in which he claimed that the series was made on a dare in order to prove that any poorly-written piece of trash would succeed as long as the cast was packed full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a>. Obviously, this was fake, but it didn't stop the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hatedom">Hatedom</a> from giving out triumphant cries of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnewIt">I Knew It!</a>!".
<ul><li> In an interview with Animerica, director Masashi Ikeda said that he didn't write the relationship between Heero and Relena as romantic because he "can't write boy-girl relationships" and considered their symbolic relationship more important. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Some yaoi fans</a> gleefully seize on this as proof that Heero/Relena is non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a> and never would be, which ignores what Ikeda said after that, which was (paraphrased) "I wouldn't rule out the possibility, though." They also ignore the fact that he said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">he didn't intend ANY romance at all</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, one of the biggest points of contention in the infamous "Great Trowa Rape Debate" was in reference to supposed interviews where the producers had "confirmed" that Trowa Barton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsBackstory">was sexually abused during his days as a mercenary</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080411084158/http://www.txq.nu/tq/soapbox/essay04.html">Obviously, these claims were fake.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasashiKishimoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasashiKishimoto">Masashi Kishimoto</a> is often mentioned as having said that Sasuke is his favorite character, particularly by people who think he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsPet">Creator's Pet</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotlightStealingSquad">too much screentime</a>. He actually said Sasuke is his favorite character... <em>to draw</em>.
</li><li> During mid-2014, persistent rumors circulated about how Kishimoto had stated that the manga would end in 2014; in truth, he did say that the manga was nearing completion and was in its final arc, but didn't put forward a concrete deadline. This is a very peculiar example in that the manga <em>did</em> end in 2014 after all, so anyone who believed the rumor was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">Right for the Wrong Reasons</a>.
</li><li> During the fandom meltdown surrounding the resolution of the series' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceArc">Romance Arcs</a>, several "translations" of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> were strategically circulated that were so out of touch with the original source that they <em>had</em> to have been deliberately engineered to cause grief, facilitate denial and mislead impressionable minds. Those consisted of a myriad in-universe and out-of-universe disheartening "true" reasons that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> got together - it was only because one of them felt sorry for the other and settled for her as a consolation prize; it only happened because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> and the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PanderingToTheBase">caving in to fan demands</a>; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipToShipCombat">TRUE love standing in its way</a> was there and mutual, but it never got to materialize merely due to some tragic misunderstanding, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenselessSacrifice">ill-conceived and needless martyrdom</a> on the part of the characters - the author failed to follow through on it on a vindictive whim, or because his hand was forced. <br/>Compared to all of this, the truth is ridiculously banal; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> got together in the usual way that fictional couples do — because the author decided, from the early stages of the manga, that it would be great if they were to fall in love, so they did. No reservations, no cynical "yeah, but"s about it. Some of the "true" alternate explanations were just fabricated whole-cloth; others were "inspired" by actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> that had little resemblence to them, and instead described considerations that are much less scandalous and are par-for-the-course for the occasion, e.g. "I threw in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">some nuggets</a> towards one pairing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">just to throw their fans off</a>, but I <em>never</em> thought about making that pairing official, because I already decided on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a> at an early stage".
</li><li> Kishimoto's involvement with the production of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoTheMovieRoadToNinja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoTheMovieRoadToNinja">Naruto the Movie: Road to Ninja</a></em> which is heavily loaded with Naruto/Sakura <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTeasing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTeasing">Ship Teasing</a>, made a lot of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">shipping</a> fans to claim that the author was giving an explicit endorsement of the pairing and that it was meant to be the official one; in reality, Kishimoto was only involved with the characters' designs and story draft, while the actual script of the movie was done by Yuka Miyata, who was infamous for her Naruto/Sakura-teasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmedWithCanon">scene additions</a> to the anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> that didn't exist in the manga (although she stopped doing this after the manga ended and the anime continued to drag on, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">obvious reasons</a>).
</li><li> When the series was reaching its end, quite a few fans claimed that Kishimoto had confirmed that in the ending Naruto would have a son named Shinachiku, based on an interview made during the promotion of the aforementioned <em>Road To Ninja</em> movie; in reality during the interview Kishimoto when asked if Naruto would have a child how would he call him, he <em>jokingly</em> answered that <em>probably</em> Shinachiku. The real names for Naruto's children turned out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Boruto and Himawari</span>.
</li><li> A few of their shippers claimed that Kishimoto had confirmed in an interview that Naruto and Sakura's relationship was based upon his and his wife's; in reality during the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2015-10-14/masashi-kishimoto-at-new-york-comic-con/.94186">interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when asked if his relationship was more similar to Naruto/Hinata than Sasuke/Sakura, he answers "it might not actually be like either", then when comparing Hinata to his wife he describes the latter as "strong", then it's <em>the interviewer</em> who suggests that Sakura could be more similar to Kishi's wife personality-wise (Naruto's relationship and dynamics with Sakura were not even mentioned).
</li><li> Some fans claimed that Kishimoto wanted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">reboot</a> the series after he finished it. In reality, according to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.spirallingsphere.com/2016/07/masashi-kishimoto-x-ikemoto-full-interview-english/">this 2016 Jump Festa interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the one who actually said that was his assistant, Mikio Ikemoto. Kishimoto has consistently said that he's happy with <em>Naruto</em> and the way he finished it, and Ikemoto stated that he loved the idea of making a sequel rather than a reboot, so after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApprovalOfGod">Kishimoto endorsed him to Shueisha</a>, he began writing the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em> manga under Kishimoto's supervision.
</li></ul></li><li> There's currently a faked <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bokurano">Bokurano</a></em> novel translation circulating the 'net, which was actually based off a wildly canon-divergent fanfic which includes, among other things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecoyProtagonist">Waku</a> as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadManWriting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadManWriting">Dead Man Writing</a> who narrates the story. It took in a fair few tropers on this very site, so watch out for that.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em> fandom, former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BNF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BNF">BNF</a> Shaloom made up multiple fake interviews by a supposed writer of the series, Hiroshi Ohnogi (who <em>did</em> work on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> metaseries but <em>not on Frontier itself</em>, though that show did have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout Outs</a> to stuff he did for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossZero">Macross Zero</a></em>). They also referred frequently to series creator <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShojiKawamori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShojiKawamori">Shoji Kawamori</a> in a pretty... bad light. Everyone believed him until someone actually went searching for the interviews in question. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.macrossworld.com/mwf/index.php?showtopic=30224">Here is the Macross World FAQ on the whole deal.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em> fandom has numerous instances of this, often as a result of fans mistranslating or misinterpreting the source material and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>:
<ul><li> The most infamous examples are Sweden's "grunting speech" (in canon he speaks with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TohokuRegionalAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TohokuRegionalAccent">Tohoku Regional Accent</a> which was mistranslated and consequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerized" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerized">Bowdlerized</a> by fandom into grunting and mumbling), and America's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> behavior being a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> (what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> <em>actually</em> said was that America <em>could</em> read the atmosphere, but he just doesn't care).
</li><li> There was also <a class="urllink" href="http://hetalia.livejournal.com/12369487.html">the claim<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that the to-be-created fifth season of <em>Hetalia</em> would make certain pairings, like US/UK, canon. Nothing was said by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> on this, and it was apparently just started up by fans.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many fans believe that the creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>, had once stated he planned to end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">the manga</a> at the Freeza arc, yet he has never once stated this. He only ever said the only planned ending for the manga was the first saga. The one who said that it should have ended in the Freeza saga was the editor at the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordofSaintPaul">Kazuhiko Torishima</a> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0uvu5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0uvu5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0uvu5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2015-06-04/dragon-ball-manga-editor-series-should-have-ended-after-frieza/.88918">Dragon Ball Manga Editor: Series Should Have Ended After Frieza, 2015.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em></span>
</li><li> He has never said anything about the original version of Broly (the new version created for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> was actually created by Toriyama), since as a movie character, Toriyama's only involvement was giving him a design. That hasn't stopped Broly fans from claiming Toriyama has said he was "the strongest" in one place or another, even fabricating "interviews" out of whole cloth to "prove" their point.
</li><li> Likewise, Toriyama has never gone on record stating a dislike of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, and was actually rather positive about it while it was on the air in Japan. The only <em>Dragon Ball</em> property he has gone record stating his <em>dislike</em> for is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonballEvolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DragonballEvolution">Dragonball Evolution</a></em>.
</li><li> The Hispanic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> seems to be in love with this trope, such as claiming that Toriyama liked <em>Dragonball Evolution.</em> and encourage people to watch it, or that Vegito in Super Saiyan 3 could beat Beerus.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagica">Puella Magi Madoka Magica</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stated that <a class="urllink" href="http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Megami_Magazine_2011-07#Mami.27s_Wish">Mami Tomoe's wish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was "to connect to life" - as in remain connected to her own life <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">because she was going to die</span>. Editors on <em>this very wiki</em> seemed to think it actually meant "connecting <em>other</em> lives" and stated that Mami had lied about her wish in the anime.
</li><li> Some people are quick to say that Gen Urobuchi changed the ending to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PuellaMagiMadokaMagicaTheMovieRebellion">Rebellion</a> to be more open-ended for the executives and that he hated it. Not true. He <em>did</em> say someone's gonna hate it, but that the people hating it would be the fanbase, ironically enough considering that the "some people" are usually members of said fanbase. As for the ending, it actually came up before Gen even wrote the script (He <em>did</em> considered an ending with more closure, but the problem was less meddling and more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersBlock">'where do I go from there?'</a> and that the idea to change the ending actually came from a co-worker.
</li></ul></li><li> An early online translation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em> manga referred to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">Crona</a> with female pronouns, because the translator couldn't quite determine what Crona's gender was. This led some fans to believe that Crona was a boy in the anime but a girl in the manga. Canonically, Crona's gender is unknown in both, but both official English translations use male pronouns for convenience. These cases happened before "they/them" became more widely used as gender-neutral pronouns in English.
</li><li> Fans flew into a panic when a magazine article stated that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DokiDokiPrettyCure">Doki Doki Pretty Cure</a></em> would end in December, a whole month earlier than usual.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12o9m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12o9m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12o9m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> series ends at the end of January/beginning of February, usually just ahead of that year's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> series</span> The director of the series went onto his Twitter that very day and reassured fans that it was still committed to a full 49 episode series.
</li><li> Happens quite a bit in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> fandom.
<ul><li> "But Naoko said this!" and "Naoko said that!", it's rarely true. Series creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> rarely gives interviews or even makes public appearances, and fans <em>very</em> rarely interact with her. There are many fan misconceptions that range from her hating the 90s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a> adaptation to regretting creating the series at all. There's also the long standing rumor that she prevented the final season of the anime from making it over to the states out of fear of how they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bowdlerize">treat it</a>. None of these are true, although supposedly she did have some issues with the original anime, there's no evidence that she outright hated it.
</li><li> There's some debate if Naoko really did approve of the English voice cast for the Viz redub. Viz themselves only say the "creator" approved them. Some believe they were actually referring to Toei. In addition, there's the longstanding rumor that Naoko hated the 90s anime dub, and that influenced the the prevention of the final season making it over. There's really no evidence one way or the other, although she did once directly complain at DiC's slow pace of bringing the show to the US, and supposedly thought Jill Frappier's performance of Luna was interesting, while finding Usagi/Serena's voice too deep.
</li><li> One Wiki once posted a "quotation" from Naoko, ostensibly from an interview, saying that the lesbian relationship between Sailors Uranus and Neptune was actually between Sailor Neptune and <em>Prince</em> Uranus, the latter of whom had died and been reborn as a girl (as his sister's powers had been passed on to him, causing him to be reborn as her). When no one could find a source for said quote, or the interview in question, the site quietly removed it.
</li><li> There's no concrete proof that Naoko said that Setsuna was part Romani, but it's a persistent rumor—and generally accepted headcanon. The official reason for Setsuna being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown">Ambiguously Brown</a> is simply aesthetic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fandom (or at least the sizable number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Natsu/Lucy</a> shippers) claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroMashima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HiroMashima">Hiro Mashima</a> stated that the two would end up together and have a child named Nashi, which isn't quite true. Rather, he was responding to a hypothetical question, not to mention that the word <em>nashi</em> is the Japanese equivalent of "n/a" (no answer, no comment, not available).
</li><li> Another claim from shippers is that Mashima said that the mind control magic Lucy fell victim to in the first chapter can only be broken by true love, or Natsu in her case. The only way to break that particular magic was actually stated in that chapter: the victim merely has to be aware that this magic is being used, which happened when Natsu distracted her. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Mashima</a> has never gone back on this explanation.
</li><li> People came under the impression from Mashima's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">manga volume afterwords</a> that he planned for <em>Fairy Tail</em> to be roughly ten volumes long, with the Phantom Lord arc being the intended ending of the manga, had positive fan reception not led him to keep it going. While Mashima <em>has</em> said the manga became far longer than he ever imagined, and credited fan reception for this, the rest is misinterpreted: ten volumes was merely Mashima's rough estimate for how long he initially thought the manga would last, with his idea for the Phantom Lord arc coming much sooner than he anticipated—both statements ironically being accompanied by his admission that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritingByTheSeatOfYourPants">he had zero plans for the manga's overall story</a>, giving his spur-of-the-moment decision to jump into Phantom Lord as an example of this.

Many fans took this as canon, even though it's not really consistent with the two films' details (Tarzan's parents look different from the king and queen, they escaped from a burning ship, not just a sunken one, and they already had baby Tarzan with them, whereas Queen Iduna showed no sign of being pregnant when she and the king left on their voyage).

It turns out the name was a joke that came from an article written by Keith Staskiewicz for <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> in July 2015. It's only two years later that Abraham Riesman of <em>Vulture</em> learned from DC Films executives that it's not the official name for that shared universe. It didn't prevent some of the people involved like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EzraMiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EzraMiller">Ezra Miller</a> from referring to it by that name or "DCEU". WB themselves usually use DC Films which is the official name of the subsidiary of the studio headed up by Walter Hamada and his team.

</li><li> Very early on, it was rumored that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattReeves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MattReeves">Matt Reeves</a>' <em>The Batman</em> would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeriodPiece">Period Piece</a> set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>, and this became such a ubiquitous talking point that many websites began reporting it as fact. However, Reeves himself never said that; the idea that the movie was set in the 90s began due to fans assuming it would be a prequel to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanVSupermanDawnOfJustice">Batman v Superman</a></em>, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertPattinson">Robert Pattinson</a> merely playing a younger version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenAffleck">Ben Affleck</a>'s Batman from the previous movies. However, as time went on, it became increasingly likely that <em>The Batman</em> would either be set in a standalone continuity or serve as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> of sorts, and Reeves eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> the whole 90s theory when saying it would explore what Batman would be like if he'd been conceived in the present day.

<ul><li> Plenty in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fandom:
<ul><li> There used to be a rumor about a gratuitous sex scene in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">the last book</a>. Everyone heard that rumor (<em>from</em> everyone else), and all the sources claimed to have heard it straight from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling">the author</a>. A video on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/TheOnion">The Onion</a> about Rowling including a date rape in an upcoming <em>Potter</em> book may have had something to do with the rumor.
</li><li> It was rumored that Rowling had confirmed <em>Harry Potter and the Green Flame Torch / Pillar of Storge / Fortress of Shadows</em> as the title of books six/seven. She responded by suggesting <em>Harry Potter and The Toenail of Icklibogg.</em>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>J.K</strong>: I am trying very hard not to feel offended that anyone thought this was possible. 'Storgé', for crying out loud. Come on, people, get a grip.
</div><ul><li> There was an article Harry/Hermione <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">shippers</a> would sometimes cite which claimed Rowling had said Harry would develop "more of an interest in pal Hermione" in book 5. Nobody was able to trace this to an actual interview, and it ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a>. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/rumours_view.cfm?id=21">More information here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Rowling never said that she may have subconsciously let the name "Harry Potter" from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Troll">Troll</a></em> series seep into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">her story</a>, regardless of what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Phelous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Phelous">Phelous</a> or any number of other people may tell you. What she actually said is that she took the name "Potter" from a family she was friends with as a child, and "Harry" simply because she has always loved that name.
</li><li> In 2016, she published a story about how there are eleven <em>prestigious</em> Wizarding schools in the world but explained that are plenty of smaller ones as well. Some people have squabbled with the fact that Europe has three but while the continents of Africa, South America, and North America have one each. Japan has one as well, leaving four of thems locations unknown. She never said that there were no schools in say, continental Asia, just that there wasnt one with a storied history while also leaving the door open for one (or more) of the undisclosed schools to be there.
</li><li> There's a quote floating around on the Internet which confirms the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">fanon</a> belief that Nagini is the snake Harry set free from the zoo, specifically "Yes, its rather funny, really, that next to no one realized the snake that Harry set free in <em>Philosopher's Stone</em> turned out to be Voldemort's final Horcrux, Nagini." It never happened. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomewhereAHerpetologistIsCrying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomewhereAHerpetologistIsCrying">There's also a scientific hole in the theory, incidentally.</a> Harry set a boa constrictor loose, which in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">the movies</a>, was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationSpeciesChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationSpeciesChange">Burmese python</a>. Neither one is venomous or has fangs. Nagini is and does.
</li><li> There are persistent rumors that Rowling said "In a fight between a wizard and a muggle with a shotgun, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglesDoItBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MugglesDoItBetter">the muggle will win every time</a>." This quote has never been traced, and whether muggles or wizards would win is a continuing debate.
</li><li> Rose/Scorpius <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shipping">Shippers</a> will often claim that Rowling has confirmed that Rose and Scorpius eventually ended up together. She hasn't.
</li><li> A really old one that people love to misquote, but Rowling never actually said that people were delusional if they ship Harry/Hermione, that was the owner of Mugglenet.com, Emerson Spartz.
</li><li> In February 2014, Rowling did an interview where she commented that Ron and Hermione would have a rocky relationship, but probably be happy after marriage counseling. A preview of the interview took that section out of context, and the press quickly twisted it into "Rowling says she should have put Hermione with Harry instead of Ron" (Harry was barely even mentioned in the interview). Naturally, <em>fans</em> then twisted this into "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has declared that Harry and Hermione are actually canon, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistantEpilogue">Distant Epilogue</a> be damned." An often overlooked segment of the interview is Rowling stating that the Ron/Hermione pairing was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WishFulfillment">Wish Fulfillment</a> on her part, Hermione being an admitted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar">Author Avatar</a> - the obvious implication being that <em>Rowling herself</em> would choose Ron.
</li><li> Rowling is often quoted on saying that Lord Voldemort was born physically incapable of loving because he was conceived under the effects of a love potion. What she actually said was that him being conceived under artificial love is supposed to symbolise his lack of understanding for love, not that it actively caused it. In the same interview, she goes on to note that he would have turned out differently if Merope had lived and raised him herself, which instantly contradicts the often Rowling-cited notion that Voldemort was born inherently evil.
</li><li> Certain fans are fond of accusing Rowling said that autism could be "cured" with magic. What she actually said was that magic can easily cure non-magical illnesses, but magical injuries and diseases were more difficult (which is to say, this is why a wizard can overcome the flu with a simple potion, but potentially die of dragon pox). Autism, being a developmental disorder, is not the same as an illness.
</li><li> On the old version of her website, Rowling had an entire section called the "Rubbish Bin" devoted to debunking rumors about both herself and the <em>Harry Potter</em> series. <a class="urllink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111220200909/http://www.jkrowling.com:80/textonly/en/rubbishbin.cfm">It can still be viewed in archived form.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Many people also seem to believe that Rowling said she had originally planned to have Hermione end up with Fred Weasley. She never did.
</li><li> In 2019, she got some flak for something she said about Dumbledore and Grindelwald that was construed to seem far more inflammatory than what she actually said. The headlines implied she said Grindelwald and Dumbledore had an intensely sexual, torrid love affair which isnt quite what she said. She said that it was intense and genuine and, in her eyes, there was a sexual element to it, but shes more interested in the non-sexual aspect of their relationship. Basically that she was more interested in the clash of two equals who shared an intense personal bond in the past that neither has gotten rid of. A lot of media outlets put the two halves together without the context that she said she personally thought it was sexual, not that it actually was that way.
</li></ul></li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> fans have claimed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenieMeyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> ruled out vampires being able to have children. Meyer herself claims she only said that <em>female</em> vampires couldn't have children but got misinterpreted. She <em>did</em>, however, say that all fluids in a vampire's body turn to "venom," later redacting this to all fluids <em>except semen</em>.
</li></ul><ul><li> In one interview, Stephenie Meyer supposedly said that she was going to write a book about "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">time-traveling mermaids</a>." If you listen to the clip it's clear that she's listing "time travel" and "mermaids" as ideas that she's considered, she just speaks a bit quickly so that it comes out sounding odd.
</li><li> Due to the complicated mess that resulted in the wake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>'s additions to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a></em> mythos, many things which were introduced with De Camp or others are mistakenly attributed to Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan. Some of these include:
<ul><li> The idea that Howard said Conan and the Hiberno-Norman warrior Cormac Fitzgeoffrey, who is stated to be 6'2" and 210lbs, were "physical doubles." This myth is even referenced on <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian#Appearance">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Not only is this very interesting factoid <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.thecimmerian.com/?p=4445">completely absent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> from Howard's letters, notes and stories, but the very numbers are incorrect—Cormac is a fraction of an inch over 6 feet, and 200lbs.
</li><li> Howard's Hyborian Age is often placed in 10,000 BC, give or take a millennium or two, as established by L. Sprague De Camp in the later Conan novels and stories. In fact, Howard never dated the Hyborian Age at all, but he did date the Thurian Age (the time period of his other barbarian king Kull of Atlantis) as 100,000 BC. Calculating the centuries that pass in the "Hyborian Age" essay, one can place the age of Conan in any period from 90,000 BC to 10,000 BC.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern">Dragonriders of Pern</a></em> fandom mostly believes in the veracity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey">Anne McCaffrey</a>'s infamous "Tent Peg" interview, in which she states that anal penetration will instantly turn a man gay, by way of explaining how riders of green and blue dragons can all be gay). However there's no actual evidence that it's more than an internet legend. She did, however, espouse similar, if much <em>much</em> milder ideas in her <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dragonridersclub.com/drmain/ammsg.html">"Renewable Air Force" essay<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>—in which she says green dragons tend to pick males with more feminine personalities and blues tend to pick <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightGay">Straight</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay">Manly Gays</a>.
</li><li> Happens all too frequently in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> fandom:
<ul><li> Often people in the fandom claimed that author Victoria Holmes said that Brambleclaw would not succeed Firestar as ThunderClan leader. In reality, she said that the leader after Firestar "might be unexpected", and noted later that her editor made her change who the leader would be.
</li><li> She is also cited as saying that Ivypool and Bumblestripe would hook up, when she actually told a fan that they could support whatever shipping they wanted to.
</li><li> Vicky is cited as saying that cats can't be named "Moon-" or "-moon" because the moon is too sacred to cats. It's not. Never are the characters shown worshipping the moon and the quote said the exact <em>opposite</em>. The real reason for this decision is that using "moon" as a prefix or suffix makes that cat seem more important or attractive than the other cats in their clan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlipFlopOfGod">Even this rule was abolished</a>, with characters like "Ambermoon" being introduced in future books.
</li><li> There are no official "naming traditions". No author has never mentioned it and it has never been stated in-universe. The only names not allowed were the before mentioned "moon" names (which later began being used) and "Hammerclaw" (Tigerclaw's original name before it was noted feral cats don't know what hammers are).
</li></ul></li><li> A common myth is that, as a toddler, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, known for writing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">The Hobbit</a></em>, was bitten by a poisonous spider in South Africa, causing him to develop a phobia about them. Therefore many of his works feature giant, malevolent arachnids, including the spiders of Mirkwood, Shelob, and Ungoliant. However, <a class="urllink" href="http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Spiders#Inspiration">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> article proves the incident was no inspiration whatsoever to the spiders. In fact, Tolkien admitted to having no dislike for spiders at all and even rescued them if they fell into the bath. However his youngest son Michael was afraid of them and Tolkien took inspiration from that when writting <em>The Hobbit</em>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Live-Action TV </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Prior to the airing of the pilot episode for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearTheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FearTheWalkingDead">Fear the Walking Dead</a></em>, the actress who played the undead Gloria gave an interview to Comicbook.com in which she believed that "everything started with Gloria". The site and many other news outlets, including Metro Newspapers, Hitfix and fansites, took this to mean that Gloria was the first walker ever created (Patient Zero), and ran stories to this effect. However, Gloria is not the first walker in the series - in the pilot, Tobias tells Madison Clark the morning after Nick's encounter with Gloria that he has heard reports of the dead coming back to life in five states, showing that the dead were reanimating before Gloria was infected. Yet, this hasn't stopped some fans from still believing this to be the case.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> The producers never said that the show would never have time travel. They once said that the then-ongoing Season Two had no time travel — and it <em>didn't</em> — but never that there would <em>never</em> be time travel. Additionally, they never stated that there was one huge clue left in the pilot — in fact, they explicitly said there <em>wasn't</em>, and the last one to be made significant was the single white tennis shoe Jack found. Yet this is repeated to this day.
</li><li> In an example of "Word of Mistaken God," an excellent way to see if someone is making something up about a producer comment is to see if they attribute it to J.J.

</li><li> They also didn't "lie" about the Purgatory theory - The fandom mistakenly believes that they said Purgatory would <em>never</em> be involved in the show, and claim that the fact that the series ended in Purgatory meant that they lied; or else they believe that the characters' explanation that <em>the Flash-Sideways and the church</em> are Purgatory means that the <em>entire series</em> was Purgatory; neither of which is the case.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaTurtlesTheNextMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NinjaTurtlesTheNextMutation">Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation</a></em> was notorious because of the unpopularity of the fifth female turtle Venus de Milo, who was despised by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> co-creator Peter Laird so much that she was barred from making appearances in any other continuities for the rest of the duration that the franchise was in his hands. After Nickelodeon obtained the rights to the franchise, many of Venus's detractors who wished for Venus to remain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledFromContinuity">Exiled from Continuity</a> cited both co-creators hating the character as a reason for why she shouldn't return, though the other co-creator Kevin Eastman has actually stated openly in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.monkeysfightingrobots.com/kevin-eastman-talks-tmnt-2-comic-death-and-venus-de-milo-awesome-con">an interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> after Nickelodeon's acquisition of the franchise that he actually likes the character and hopes for her to someday make a comeback.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> is notorious for this sort of thing, though it can get complex because often "fan-created canon" or "fanon" often overlaps with the mistaken belief that "God" originally said something-or-other.
<ul><li> Just one example occurred with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> which raised the ire of some fans for establishing a Vulcan serving with Starfleet, when the belief was Spock was the first. Many claims were made that the series violated established on-screen canon in this regard... until members of one of the Star Trek fan forums actually went back through all the televised episodes and movies and could find no such reference to Spock being the first Vulcan in Starfleet (in fact, the existence of an all-Vulcan ship in the original series establishes that Vulcans in Starfleet are not especially new or unusual).
</li><li> One could write a book on all the various non-canon ideas that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> fans routinely believe are canon, but one of the least talked about is a belief among fans that humans of the 24th Century have learned how to "always get along" and never fight with each other. Because of this, they tend to bash <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and <em>Voyager</em>, or even declare them not canon, because of the very concept of the Maquis, and other instances of humans fighting with humans. They cling to this even though <em>The Next Generation</em> never shied away from human-vs-human conflict. What <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneRoddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> actually said was that humans have learned to rise above "petty bickering", but even he understood that there would always be legitimate issues that would cause conflict between humans.
</li><li> This example has been referenced in mainstream press, especially around the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDiscovery">Star Trek: Discovery</a></em> as factual, and showrunner Aaron Harberts has discussed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.themarysue.com/star-trek-discovery-changing-roddenberrys-no-conflict-mandate/">tossing out the so-called rule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as a way of marketing the new show.
</li></ul></li><li> A common misconception about Joe Odagiri is that he hated his role as Yusuke Godai, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderKuuga">Kamen Rider Kuuga</a></em>. This stems from a mistranslated interview, <a class="urllink" href="http://tokusatsunetwork.com/2016/03/15074/">as noted here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - while he <em>does</em> dislike Tokusatsu as a whole<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9ccgu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9ccgu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9ccgu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">most notably, his agency forced him to audition for a part in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyuKyuSentaiGoGoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KyuKyuSentaiGoGoV">Kyu Kyu Sentai Go Go V</a></em>; the staff asked him to do a pose, which he refused to, so he was rejected</span>, and he disliked doing <em>Kuuga</em> at the time<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note103ad5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note103ad5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note103ad5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">this was because he had passed the audition, and at the time, his only other option aside from playing Godai was to quit acting and leave his agency</span>, looking back, he does not regret his time playing the part. The only reason that the part isn't listed in his profile on his agency's website (the removal of said part is what started the rumor) is because it wasn't his debut - Odagiri himself says that there are other roles he did at the time that aren't listed either, and since <em>Kuuga</em> wasn't his debut, they can't give the part special treatment.

No, it was actually an error made by FANDOM. In reality, that was actually an insult Bigs made, and the misspelling came from a <em>Morphin Legacy</em> video title.
</li><li> Many fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUmbrellaAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheUmbrellaAcademy">The Umbrella Academy</a></em> seem to be under the impression that the creators intend to have eight seasons, in correspondence to the eight planned issues of the comic book. In actuality there is no such proof that this is the case and the only quote from the runners close to this actually imply that they're aiming for less seasons than eight.

</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>"Street Spirit" is our purest song, but I didnt write it. It wrote itself. We were just its messengers; its biological catalysts. Its core is a complete mystery to me, and, you know, I wouldnt ever try to write something that hopeless. All of our saddest songs have somewhere in them at least a glimmer of resolve. Street Spirit has no resolve. It is the dark tunnel without the light at the end. It represents all tragic emotion that is so hurtful that the sound of that melody is its only definition. We all have a way of dealing with that song. Its called detachment. Especially me; I detach my emotional radar from that song, or I couldnt play it. Id crack. Id break down on stage. Thats why its lyrics are just a bunch of mini-stories or visual images as opposed to a cohesive explanation of its meaning. I used images set to the music that I thought would convey the emotional entirety of the lyric and music working together. Thats whats meant by all these things youll one day swallow whole. I meant the emotional entirety, because I didnt have it in me to articulate the emotion. Id crack Our fans are braver than I to let that song penetrate them, or maybe they dont realise what theyre listening to. They dont realise that Street Spirit is about staring the fucking devil right in the eyes, and knowing, no matter what the hell you do, hell get the last laugh. And its real, and true. The devil really will get the last laugh in all cases without exception, and if I let myself think about that too long, Id crack. I cant believe we have fans that can deal emotionally with that song. Thats why Im convinced that they dont know what its about. Its why we play it towards the end of our sets. It drains me, and it shakes me, and hurts like hell every time I play it, looking out at thousands of people cheering and smiling, oblivious to the tragedy of its meaning, like when youre going to have your dog put down and its wagging its tail on the way there. Thats what they all look like, and it breaks my heart. I wish that song hadnt picked us as its catalysts, and so I dont claim it. It asks too much. I didnt write that song."</em>

<ul><li> <em>L'Osservatore Romano</em>— a perpetual source. Just because the newspaper of Vatican City pans <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> does not mean that <em>the Pope</em> condemns it. It's just a newspaper.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Religion </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This actually happens quite frequently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, being perhaps the most translated text of all time. (for the purposes of this list, all quotations will be from the King James Version unless otherwise noted).
</li><li> Genesis 3, which is about the Fall of Adam and Eve from Eden, is often summarized as "the Devil tricks Adam and Eve into eating an apple".
<ul><li> Christian tradition states that Satan took the form of a snake, this is never specified in the chapter itself. However, a verse that suggests that Satan did take the form of a snake is Revelation 12:9, which says: "And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
</li><li> It's also often said that the serpent had legs before God curses it for tricking Adam and Eve, but the text only states that afterwards he was cursed to crawl on his belly.
</li><li> The <em>periy</em> ("fruit") is never specified as an apple (the word though is hard to translate into English as it means any plant product — fruit, grain, nuts, berries, edible leaves, etc.) — the idea of it being an apple comes from the Latin word <em>malus</em>, which means both "apple" and "evil"; the Apple of Discord by Eris, which led to the Judgment of Paris and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTrojanWar">The Trojan War</a>; and John Milton's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ParadiseLost">Paradise Lost</a>, an epic poem that states that the fruit was an apple. Whether the fruit is indeed an apple or not, the point is that Adam and Eve were told <em>not</em> to eat the fruit, they ate it anyway, <em>and</em> didn't own up to their error.
</li></ul></li><li> Exodus 34:29 is as follows: "And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him." This verse refers to Moses as having rays of light, not horns, emanating from his face. The image of Moses having horns comes from the Vulgate, a translation of the Bible into Latin by St. Jerome, which translates קָרַ֛ן, qāran (based on the root, קָ֫רֶן qeren, which often means "horn") into "cornuta". Even so, "horned" in this context is very likely meant to mean "glorified".
<ul><li> Joseph's coat may have been "richly ornamented" or "of many colors" depending on the translation<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11elhj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11elhj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11elhj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though if you're trying to be ornamental, many colors is the go-to</span>
</li><li> The sea creature that swallowed Jonah is expressly called a דג גדול - a big fish. However, at the time whales were generally considered to be just a large kind of fish; the distinction between whales (which are mammals) and fish wouldn't be made for several centuries yet.
</li><li> The Ten Commandments themselves. Aside from slight differences in dividing up the commandments between the original Hebrew and subsequent Christian versions, there are a few cases where people have deliberately tried to mistranslate or misread earlier versions, such as with the Commandment "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a>." The original word used in the Hebrew version, רצח (r-ṣ-ḥ), clearly means just <em>murder</em> of the premeditated kind, as in "lie in wait for innocent blood" and the like (elsewhere, the command is that murderers and other criminals are to be executed, and accidental killings are not to be punished). Capital punishment and war are clearly not breaches of this Commandment, as they're specifically authorized on many occasions.
</li><li> And "taking God's name in vain" is a rather sparse translation. It more literally means something like "You are not to take God's name up for nothingness" i.e. don't go using it casually to back up worthless and dubious claims, or claiming God as an ally in some scheme you're trying to pull (this can especially be applied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptablePoliticalTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptablePoliticalTargets">politicians</a> and the like).
</li><li> The identification of Satan as "Lucifer" or "the Morning Star." This comes from Isaiah 14:12, which does not refer to Satan, but King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. His fall from power is being compared with the fall of the morning star, Venus (Lucifer in Latin). This was later lumped in with Satan's fall (itself subject to a great deal of legend).
</li><li> The New Testament provides an example recounted within the Gospels; God gave a number of general rules, but by Jesus' time these had been analyzed and quantified into strict rules by the Pharisees. When the Pharisees tried to call Jesus on his "rule-breaking", he often explained that they had over-analyzed the letter of the law and missed the spirit completely. For example, in Matthew 12:1-2, Jesus' disciples were plucking ears of corn with their hands, but the Pharisees accused them of working on the Sabbath: "At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day". The irony is that the disciples' actions were in accordance to Deuteronomy 23:25: "When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn".
</li><li> Despite the common interpretation, not once in the Bible does it mention that the angels sent down to Earth (e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchangelGabriel">Gabriel</a>) have wings. Indeed the descriptions of them are often vague at best, describing them only by what they wore or being surrounded by bright light. The ones that are described as having wings have multiple pairs and some have eyes on their wings too... others are far closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a>. There's a set of angels in Ezekiel, for example, who take the form of "topaz wheels made of eyes", who may or may not act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Jars</a> for even stronger angels! The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> we know and love are a creation of Medieval European art (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> was around even then).
<ul><li> Also, there is ambiguity about the term 'angel' itself. Occasionally it is used almost interchangeably with God himself (perhaps similar to 'avatar').<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12sgam');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12sgam" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12sgam');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Hebrew word "mal'ach" and the Greek word "angelos" both mean "messenger".</span> And the more... colorful descriptions tend to use other words, such as 'seraph'. Also these descriptions take place solely in heavenly visions and revelations, and whether they are to be taken literally is highly debatable.
</li><li> 'Angel' has such a feminine connotation in modern English, despite the fact that the only times angels have a specified gender in the Bible, it is male. This has led to the oddity of angels in general being thought of as being female, but most angel characters in works are male or sexless.
</li><li> Speaking of angels, Gabriel is not actually an archangel. Per definition there can only be one (the word essentially meaning "the highest one of the angels"), and the Bible only mentions one by that title - Michael.
</li><li> Also related to angels, there is absolutely no reason to think that the Bible states or even implies that humans can or will become angels after death. Unlike most misconceptions, this one is actually fairly recent as it was popularized by such things as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItsAWonderfulLife">It's a Wonderful Life</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Much of the conception of the Apocalypse is based on the commentaries contained in the <em>Scofield Reference Bible</em>. So you get ideas such as the Jews returning to Israel and expelling all non-Jews as required for Jesus to come back. Much of it was reinterpreted by televangelists, and it all went well, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">America sided with Iraq (Babylon) against Iran (Persia)</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericaSavesTheDay">America Saves the Day</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">The Great Politics Mess-Up</a> should've discredited it altogether, but like all memes, it won't die. Also found in the <em>Scofield</em> was James Ussher's chronology of the Universe, which dates Creation to the 22 of October 4004 BC. Which is still what Young Earth Creationists believe. Ignoring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">the obvious</a>, not only was Ussher's chronology not the first, nor did the others arrive at the same date<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13pktc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13pktc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13pktc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">most calculations clustered around 4000 or 5500 BC, depending on manuscript tradition</span>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">not even Ussher was completely literal with his derivation</a>, having shoehorned certain passages so that Jesus was born 4000 years after Creation when the Bible does not state this.
</li><li> The King James translation of Deuteronomy 23:17 is as follows: "There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel".
</li><li> The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse are, in order of appearance, Conquest (not Pestilence), War, Famine, and Death. Except that of the four horsemen, Death is the only one that is explicitly named. Conquest, War, and Famine are names given to the other three horsemen based on what they did.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note147ik4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note147ik4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note147ik4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The verses describing them are Revelation 6:1-8 "And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Though multiple examples of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins">Seven Deadly Sins</a> can be seen throughout the Bible, the seven sins are not explicitly referred to as such. The doctrine of the seven deadly sins is developed by a group of early Christians known as the Desert Fathers, who lived in about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">the third century A.D. It wasn't considered part of Catholic doctrine until 590 AD</a>.
</li><li> One important blessing of the Jewish <em>Shaharit</em> (morning) Service thanks God for giving "(something) the ability to distinguish day from night." In one Reform prayerbook, the "something" is translated as the mind. In one Orthodox prayerbook, the "something" is translated as the heart. In reality, it is an ancient Hebrew word for <em>rooster</em>, the alarm clock of the pre-Industrial era.
</li><li> Due to the meaning of the word evolving over time, it is likely that the prohibition against cooking a kid (young goat) in its mother's <em>milk</em> originally banned cooking the kid in its mother's <em>fat</em>. That's right, to the ancient Israelites, there may not have been anything wrong with a cheeseburger. Unless it was fried. Poultry was declared meat in the rabbinical era, some time after the above line was interpreted to mean "don't mix dairy products and meat." Initially it was pareve (food that can be eaten with either milk or meat) like fish still is because birds don't nurse their young. The issue comes up frequently because kids, when learning the above line, start asking Kids Say the Darnedest Things-esque questions about how one milks a chicken.
</li><li> The continuous argument of the creation of earth and life by God being completed in 6 Days (popularized as 7 Days). For many, religious or not, this has been interpreted as meaning: 24 hours for each day in a human's grasp of time.
<ul><li> The original Hebrew word ("yom") is almost an exact equivalent of English "day". That is, it <em>can</em> be used in a sense where it doesn't mean 24 hours (English example: "In Abraham Lincoln's day")— <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationWithAnAgenda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationWithAnAgenda">despite what Young Earth Creationists want you to believe</a>. Even assuming a more literal interpretation of the word "day" as "solar cycle," <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">the fact that the sun wasn't created until the fourth day raises some questions</a>.
</li><li> Similarly, it's possible that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MethuselahSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MethuselahSyndrome">the ridiculously high ages of some Old Testament characters</a> were supposed to be in months rather than years but were mistranslated.
</li></ul></li><li> Neither the number of <em>magoi</em> that come to visit the baby Jesus nor their names are explicitly mentioned. Nor were the magi explicitly referred to as kings.
<ul><li> Some early Christians (and the Western Church) think there were three magi because three types of gifts were offered. Those who do identify the magi as Gaspar, a king of India; Melchior a king of Persia; and Balthasar, a king of Arabia. On the other hand, some Eastern Churches lists up to twelve magi and have different names for the magi; the Syriac Church identifies three magi as Larvandad, Hormisdas, and Gushnasaph.
</li><li> The word "magi" referred to a Mediterranean perception of Zoroastrians (Persian monotheists who follow the prophet Zarathustra and the god Ahura Mazda) as skilled astrologers who could control the fates. The magi were referred to as "kings" because of prophecies in the Old Testament describing that the Messiah will be worshipped by kings. One of them is Psalm 72:10-11, which reads: "The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts. Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him."

<ul><li> The fanbase is infamous for believing fan videos or theories to be factual. The whole "Purple Guy is named Vincent because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MxBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MxBones">a Tumblr user</a> used that name in their artwork" incident is the most well known example.
</li><li> In a case of "God <em>did</em> say that, but not at that time", there were many who considered "William Afton" to be the Murderer's canon name <em>long</em> before Scott confirmed it to be the case; in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddysSisterLocation">Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location</a></em>, he's simply Mr. Afton. He was previously called William Afton in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveNightsAtFreddysTheSilverEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FiveNightsAtFreddysTheSilverEyes">Five Nights at Freddy's: The Silver Eyes</a></em>, which is not canon to the games.
</li></ul></li><li> For a while, fans liked to report that the creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> wanted to put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Vincent Valentine</a> in the game, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> made him put Cloud in instead, so he gave Cloud Vincent's design to compensate. It turns out this was a misunderstanding - all he said was that he would have <em>liked</em> to put Vincent in the game, not that he originally planned to do so. His plan was always to include Cloud, and the reason for Cloud using Vincent's design was that Cloud was on the side of darkness in this game, so they wanted to make him look a bit demonic - and since Vincent already kind of looked like that, they just went ahead and used his design.
<ul><li> The interview accompanying the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory">Toy Story</a></em> reveal trailer for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsIII">Kingdom Hearts III</a></em> didn't say that <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is canon to <em>Toy Story</em>. What Nomura actually said was that he's interwoven the films' timeline into the game rather than create an alternate version of the events.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> relies almost entirely on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirectLineToTheAuthor">Direct Line to the Author</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrators</a> for storytelling (the various mutually-contradictory routes in the games are <em>all canon</em> simultaneously and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium">Universe Compendiums</a> are in-verse documents) and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">Shrug of God</a> is rampant, so when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReclusiveArtist">ZUN</a> does deem it necessary to deliver something definitive it is given enormous weight, and inevitably this trope tends to occur:
<ul><li> Probably the most wide-spread and believed example is ZUN outright forbidding any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeOfTheGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimeOfTheGame">Anime of the Game</a> from being made; what he actually said was if any anime was made (say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MusouKakyouASummerDaysDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MusouKakyouASummerDaysDream">Musou Kakyou: A Summer Day's Dream</a></em>) that the creators make it obvious that it is a fan-made endeavor and is not at all official.
</li><li> Similarly, it is generally accepted that the reason ZUN won't give permission for an official <em>Touhou</em> anime is because he doesn't want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDisplacement">Adaptation Displacement</a> to occur, which would almost certainly happen given that the actual games, despite the popularity of <em>Touhou</em> as a phenomenon, is still an obscure shmup series. ZUN hasn't yet explained this refusal.
</li><li> Many fans (including this wiki) think that ZUN confirmed the names of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBystander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBystander">Daiyousei and Koakuma</a>, two background characters for whom fans invented names and personalities. What he said was that "Daiyousei" and "Koakuma" are the names of specific types of youkai, of which those two are members, and said nothing about the names of the individuals.
</li></ul></li><li> Misquoted and falsified information prior to a game's launch can easily persuade people. For example, a rumor was started in the months leading up to the launch of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> that it would only be five hours long. The game is actually said to be over <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.destructoid.com/deus-ex-human-revolution-to-be-over-25-hours-long-191856.phtml">twenty five<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> hours long.

Based on a scene in the game's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a> "The Answer," an explanation began making the rounds among fans that they were designed that way by Mitsuru in order to convince Akihiko to become her first official recruit into the fight against the Shadows, either by appealing to his self-destructive tendencies or just purely on the basis of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. This is false: as stated in an interview with Producer &amp; Director Katsura Hashino in <em>Persona 3 Official Design Works</em>, the Evokers were shaped like guns because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the act of putting a gun to one's head and pulling the trigger creates a visceral response similar to playing Russian Roulette, testing the Persona user's resolve every single time they use the Evoker.</a> The cutscene in The Answer states only that Mitsuru chose her approach to catch Akihiko's attention; this statement is not in any way related to the subject of the design of the Evokers, which had already been determined long beforehand.

When he shared this info, he also offered his own interpretation that he felt Kanji was gay as well. This is often used as proof of Kanji's orientation despite the actual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> stating that Kanji's orientation is up to the interpretation of the player.

</li><li> Despite it being commonly quoted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has <em>not</em> said that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dojima</span> was originally planned to be the killer.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> canon has several examples:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter">live-action film</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StreetFighter">cartoon</a>, aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">combining Blanka and Charlie into Carlos "Charlie" Blanka</a>, assigned first and last names and titles to characters who didn't have them normally (i.e. Ryu <strong>Hoshi</strong>, Chun-Li <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Zang/Xiang</a></strong>, <strong>William F.</strong> Guile, Dhalsim being a last name, <strong>Victor</strong> Sagat, etc.), which are sometimes attributed to the characters in other canon. Chun-Li's father's name has never been revealed, but is given as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Dorai/Dourai</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/StreetFighterIIV">Street Fighter II V</a></em> (the same anime also gave Vega/Balrog/Claw a surname, <strong>Fabio la Cerda</strong>) as well as the UDON comics.

However, this was due to a mistranslation.

Nowadays, fans like to run with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">BOTH versions</a>.
</li><li> Akuma's ultimate attack, the Raging Demon (Shun Goku Satsu or "Instant Hell Murder" in original Japanese) is often touted as an attack in which Akuma grabs his opponent and sends them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Hell</a> where demons do all sorts of unspeakable things to them while the screen briefly cuts to black and the sounds of dozens of heavy blows are heard. This is often claimed to have been stated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">a "Japanese sourcebook"</a> or stated by "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">Capcom executives</a>", but no copies of said book have been found and no one can pinpoint exactly where this information came from. <em>Street Fighter V</em> revealed that Akuma brutally beats you to death by striking your vital areas from all angles at the speed of light.
</li></ul></li><li> Thanks to the rather vehement <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> surrounding <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidOtherM">Metroid: Other M</a></em>, it has been persistently reported that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em> co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto declared the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrimeTrilogy">Metroid Prime Trilogy</a></em>, handled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RetroStudios">Retro Studios</a> with minimal involvement from him, to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">Canon Discontinuity</a>, a talking point that frequently factors into arguments that he is taking <em>Metroid</em> down the wrong path. In reality, he said that he considers those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Interquel">Interquels</a> to be fully canonical side-stories; the closest any statement has come to declaring the <em>Prime</em> games non-canon is him admitting he didn't specifically factor them into the plot of <em>Other M</em>. He later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">rectified this oversight</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidSamusReturns">Metroid: Samus Returns</a></em>, which features more references to the <em>Prime</em> games, particularly with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">Ridley</a> transitioning from his cyborg-form Meta Ridley to his organic body from <em>Super Metroid</em></span>.
</li><li> The late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoruIwata">Satoru Iwata</a> had multiple cases of this:
<ul><li> When he said in early 2013 that reaching a certain operating income target for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s profits in that fiscal year was a commitment of his, it somehow got broadly reported that he was promising to resign if the goal was not reached (which it wasn't). He had to directly refute the resignation rumor during a shareholder's meeting later that June.
</li><li> In early 2014 there was a lot of rumors that Nintendo would go under, cancel support for the Wii U home console and then go mobile<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note155k2s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note155k2s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note155k2s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Largely stemming from the whole "Ninten-doomed" idea.</span>. Iwata addressed all these points in a shareholder meeting at the end of February: specifically stating that they would NOT happen. When they <em>did</em> decide to start licensing mobile games the following year, they even specifically announced a new dedicated hardware product at the same time in order to make it clear that they weren't quitting hardware.
</li><li> When the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoSwitch">Nintendo Switch</a> was announced under the codename "NX" but before any meaningful detail was revealed about the system, some message board posters convinced themselves Satoru Iwata had ruled out the possibility of the NX being an portable/home console hybrid and used the supposed claim to "debunk" any speculation it would be one. When the Switch was properly unveiled and did end up being an hybrid, fans went back to the investor meeting transcript where this was supposedly said and found out Iwata's statement was actually far more vague and less definitive than claimed, more among the lines of "We will talk more about this when we have more to share about the system".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>:
<ul><li> Considering the headaches spent trying to figure out the timeline of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em>, it was almost inevitable that one timeline or another would emerge in popular consensus as "official" and "verified". It was rarely stated who did the supposed verification, and flew in the face of several creators. A general chronology was still believed to exist in the midst of this, believed to be flexible enough to put any new game they want anywhere in the timeline without screwing it up. In 2011, an <em>actual</em> official timeline came out that (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">mostly</a>) settled all debates regarding the games released up to that point. As for some of the games released after the fact...
</li><li> As the <em>Zelda</em> team started revealing bits of information about the DLC for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>, they consistently said that "The Champions' Ballad", the second, story-focused DLC pack, would be a "new story" focusing more on the Champions. Many gaming news publications interpreted this to mean that the DLC pack would be an epilogue story taking place after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of the base game. Turns out "The Champions' Ballad" meshed chronologically with the base game instead, with the ending of the base game unaltered.
</li></ul></li><li> The creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MasahiroSakurai">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, tends to receive this a lot:
<ul><li> Some people insisted that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U</a></em> would have less characters than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em> because Sakurai said so. What he actually said was that if adding characters was the only thing he did, the game wouldn't be any better. Even when the pre-launch revealed roster for <em>Smash 4</em> exceeded 30, with many veterans still unannounced, and months to go before the 3DS version's release, such people still insisted the cast was going to be smaller than <em>Brawl</em>'s 39. The final pre-DLC roster, not counting Mii Fighters, totaled in at 48.
</li><li> In reference to a third party's "origins", he specifically said "no manga/anime characters". A later claim was that he wouldn't consider characters unless they debuted on a Nintendo system, which was debunked when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Cloud Strife</a> became playable. (And come on, fans know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonictheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonictheHedgehog">Sonic</a> obviously didn't debut on Nintendo, yet he's been in Smash since <em>Brawl</em>). In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManClassic">Mega Man</a> was the only third party fighter to have debuted on a Nintendo console at the time of Cloud's reveal, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Snake</a> debuted on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MSX">MSX2</a>, Sonic debuted on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Ryu</a> originally appeared in arcades.
</li><li> When Sakurai lamented about <em>The Subspace Emissary</em> cutscenes being uploaded onto the internet and said he wasn't going to have cutscenes like that in <em>Smash 4</em> because of it, many people took it to mean that Sakurai abhorred spoilers and would thus not try to keep any content secret in <em>Smash 4</em>. What Sakurai actually lamented, though, was since the cutscenes were something that could only really be enjoyed on a first viewing, that a player would <em>not need to actually buy and play the game to enjoy them</em> if they could just watch them on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, i.e. the massive amount of development and space that was put into the cutscenes went to waste as people who didn't own and play the game could just watch them on YouTube. Thus it was simply more feasible for Sakurai to put all that development and space into the actual game.
</li><li> Before Mewtwo was announced as the first DLC character, many were insisting that <em>U/3DS</em> would not have any DLC because Sakurai said that he didn't want any DLC. What he really said was that he wants to make the game as complete as possible, and that <a class="urllink" href="http://nintendoeverything.com/sakurai-on-how-smash-bros-wii-u3ds-came-to-be-not-opposed-to-dlc-patching-why-villagertrainer-are-in-more/">he wasn't opposed to the idea<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and would consider it once he felt satisfied with the released product.
</li><li> Using the example of a fighting game character, Sakurai commented once that the nature of a character's home game is not enough to inherently grant them a spot in the roster over anyone else, and more than anything his criteria is they must bring something interesting and unique to the table. The fanbase warped this into "no fighting game characters, ever". Try saying that now that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Ryu, Ken</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Terry</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS">Min Min</a> are in the game.
</li><li> Near the end of the E3 2018 presentation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, he stated that because the focus was on bringing back every previous fighter in the series, he hoped that people wouldn't expect too many newcomers this time around. Many news outlets took this to mean that the entire roster had already been revealed at E3, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Inkling</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Daisy</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Ridley</a> as the only newcomers. It later turned out that there would be 8 more newcomers for the game; while 11 total for the base game was the smallest number of newcomers for a <em>Smash Bros.</em> up to that point, it was still more than people initially thought there would be after E3.
</li><li> Sakurai has claimed before that he always develops the latest <em>Smash Bros.</em> entry like it's going to be the last one in the series, as well as declaring that he isn't sure if he will be working in the next <em>Smash Bros.</em>' development. This tends to get twisted a lot into "Sakurai said this is the last <em>Smash Bros.</em> game".
</li><li> Within the community, there's a large amount of made-up rules (often called "fanrules") that people cite as reasons why a particular character "can't" or "won't" be added to <em>Ultimate</em>. The only rule Sakurai has given is "no fourth-parties" (i.e. characters who aren't originally from video games such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Goku</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek">Shrek</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>), but a casual perusal of Discord servers, Twitter, and any other online gathering place will show people saying characters can't be made playable in the game for various reasons (even if they're directly contradicted by characters who are already in the game). These include: "only appearing in one game" (which could be proven wrong as early as Ness in the first game, with later additions like the Ice Climbers, Sheik, Lucas, and Duck Hunt only disproving it further), "being a Spirit or Assist Trophy" (the most lauded fanrule, which was recently halfway debunked by Min Min and could be taken further with the Mewtwo and Lucas Trophies in <em>3DS/Wii U</em> which Spirits serve to replace), "being a Mii costume" (debunked <em>in the previous game</em> when Meta Knight's Mii costume was revealed before the character himself was), "their aesthetic clashing with the game" (Toon Link and Solid Snake have appeared in the same game <em>twice</em>), "not having moveset potential" (in a <a class="urllink" href="https://sourcegaming.info/2020/03/09/this-is-my-role-sakurais-famitsu-column-vol-598/">Famitsu column<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Sakurai shot this one down) or "not being well-known by the general public" (this was also discredited by Sakurai in "Mr. Sakurai Presents "Terry Bogard"", where he said "whether or not the character is fun to play as is more important than whether the character is new or old, or whether the character is recognizable to everyone").
</li><li> Some of the <em>Smash</em> fanbase (especially disgruntled fans who didn't want <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> content in the game) twisted Sakurai's words in the message following the reveal trailer for Steve/Alex about adding them to <em>Ultimate</em> being "a challenge" and that he was "asked" to add them into claims that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">forced to include Steve against his will</a> and never wanted Steve in the first place. However, in the trailer Sakurai makes it clear that he was perfectly happy to add Steve/Alex to the game (being an active <em>Minecraft</em> player himself), and the only challenge was that he was originally unsure that he could create a moveset that was true to the character and the gameplay of <em>Minecraft</em>, but after being encouraged again, he did so anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> within <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> is "<em>Delta Rising</em> is the best expansion EVER and the players LOVE it", claiming that someone within Cryptic proclaimed the game's second expansion was an out-and-out success, particulary amongst fans who did <em>not</em>, in fact, like <em>Delta Rising</em>. In actuality, they were saying that the expansion was a <em>financial</em> success. The players just took the quote, applied a heaping dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Sarcasm Mode</a> and we're off to the races.
</li><li> There's plenty of this in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em> series, mainly thanks to two fan story guides written during the <em>Tekken 3/4</em> era. Unfortunately, both writers heavily dipped into the non-canon <em>Tekken</em> OVA, as well as some "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfDante">creative writing</a>", in order to fill in some of the gaps in the story (most of the official profiles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">weren't available online</a> at the time). Perhaps the most perduring "fact" that still today is believed canon is Kazuya's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> after he got thrown the ravine by Heihachi, something taken from the OVA and contradicted in <em>Tekken 2</em> (Devil's bio states Kazuya was not aware of his presence).
</li><li> The most infuriating aspect of Selena Recital from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Super Robot Wars Alpha 3</a></em> was how little of a back-story she had compared to the other <em>Alpha 3</em> protagonists. This has led to such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMassGuessing">Wild Mass Guessing</a> regarding her origins that the popular "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAdvance">Shadow-Mirror</a> theory" of her being one of their agents being sent across <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMultiverse">The Multiverse</a> is also one of the most implausible.
</li><li> A rather common one in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em> series is that the members of Team Star Fox are amputees. Supposedly the metal boots they all wear are actually prosthetic legs that help them withstand G forces normal pilots couldn't survive. This actually started as a fan theory sent in to Nintendo Power, which later got referenced by Did You Know Gaming? During an interview with Miyamoto, Matthew Patrick of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/GameTheory">Game Theory</a></em> asked about it, to which Miyamoto responded he had been hearing that a lot lately, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z6a8Oswk1s">but hadn't thought of that<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> while developing the game.
</li><li> Within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>, there have been several instances of either mistaken or straight-up invented sources:
<ul><li> It was <a class="urllink" href="http://shadowofchaos725.tumblr.com/post/123278984825/what-the-hell-fe-fandom-not-again">"reported"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that head writer Shin Kibayashi hated working on the game's story and disowned it on Twitter, but in reality he had just said that he didn't like taking all the credit for the plot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfTheBand">when there was actually a whole writing team behind it</a> and he didn't want them to be overshadowed.
</li><li> Rena Strober (Azura's English VA) never claimed she was completely blind during the recording process. She didn't know much about Azura when she auditioned, but she was given proper information as it became relevant and she interjected when stories began falsely accusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a> of withholding information from her.
</li><li> Thanks to a line by Leo in the beginning of the game, players believe that Elise was aged up for the Western release. His exact words were "... act like the adult you <em>technically</em> are..." which only means that Elise meets the age requirement for an adult by the standards of the game's universe. These standards are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnreveal">never actually revealed in the game itself,</a> and if anything, only serve to highlight that she is indeed quite young compared to the rest of the cast, even if she is of marriageable age.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note16vc8k');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note16vc8k" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note16vc8k');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(In Roman and later Medieval/Renaissance times, a noblewoman was usually considered "marriageable" when she hit puberty and therefore was able to have children, so Elise is <em>at her youngest</em> 12-13 years old.)</span>
</li><li> Also no, the character designer Yusuke Kozaki <em>never</em> compared <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">Camilla</a> to a cow. <a class="urllink" href="http://jokerthebutler.tumblr.com/post/134877774683/kusakihara-art-director-camillas-crown-is">That was Toshiyuki Kusakihara, the art director and Kozaki's boss<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and it was during a <em>group interview</em> for the newest FE artbook.

What Avellone <em>really</em> said was that after consuming the entire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a>, he used Kreia's character to question things he hated about <em>the Force</em> (mainly that it's used as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientMoralityLicense">Omniscient Morality License</a> and the fact it has "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantFightFate">a will</a>" being used as an explanation for the EU's perpetual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyEndingOverride">Happy Ending Override</a>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a></em> was originally envisioned as a prequel to the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerTiberianDawn">Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Dawn</a></em>, but then <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRedAlert2">Red Alert 2</a></em> came along and made it much more difficult to envision a concrete link between <em>Red Alert</em> and the <em>Tiberium</em> games. Then someone got the idea that both of <em>Red Alert</em>'s endings were canon in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateContinuity">alternate continuities</a>, where an Allied victory lead to <em>Red Alert 2</em>, and a Soviet one led to <em>Tiberian Dawn</em>. This doesn't really make any sort of sense (just to start, the first game's Global Defense Initiative is explicitly a United Nations-backed organization; the United Nations probably wouldn't continue existing if the Soviets under Stalin conquered the world), but thanks at least in part to the Soviet ending of <em>Red Alert</em> where the Brotherhood of Nod gets explicit namedrops and Stalin's oddly-familiar advisor reveals himself to be Nod's leader Kane (not to mention his apparent lack of aging in the fifty years between the first two games, which actually did become something of a plot point later), this theory became popular enough that a lot of people started believing it was canon, even after the developers actually made a statement saying that the two series were now completely separate.
</li><li> A more minor example is that some fans of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquerRenegade">Command &amp; Conquer: Renegade</a></em> believe that it takes place in 2020. That was actually a typo in the manual; it's supposed to be 2002, as implied by the technology overall being the same as in the original game. Part of the issue, besides that typo, is probably that a concrete date for when the original game takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">was never explicitly stated within the game</a>, so a lot of fans just assume it takes place in 1995, the same year it was released.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekiKamiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HidekiKamiya">Hideki Kamiya</a> gets these regarding a few of his games, and opinions on other subjects.
<ul><li> To those who wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Dante</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bayonetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> to fight, no, he did not say Bayonetta would win. It was a joke about how women usually have the final say over men in a relationship.
</li><li> Nor does he hate <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>; there were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">multiple requests from people over and over</a> to put Bayonetta in the game, causing him to tell them to "fuck off".

</li><li> People often cite the fact that Kamiya has never directed a sequel to any of his games<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19zjqd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19zjqd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19zjqd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><em>Devil May Cry</em>, <em>Viewtiful Joe</em>, <em>Okami</em>, and <em>Bayonetta</em> have all had sequels, but Kamiya was not in the director's chair for any of them.</span> as evidence that he hates sequels. In actuality, he has nothing against sequels at all, and actively wants to make sequels to many of his games. He just never gets the chance to direct them himself due to business/availability reasons.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note201xo1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note201xo1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note201xo1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">PlatinumGames do not own the IPs they develop, nor do they own the franchises they made as Clover Studio. So it's at the publisher's discretion to make a sequel and bring him back. The times when they have done so are often while Kamiya is knee-deep in other projects.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em>: A commonly-cited quote from Koji Igarashi (IGA) is something to the effect of "No woman could ever be a Belmont", in regards to the decision to remove <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CastlevaniaLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/CastlevaniaLegends">Castlevania Legends</a></em> from continuity. This is used as evidence that IGA is a misogynist. Funnily enough, though, nobody can ever provide the <em>source</em> of that quote, just saying it's from "an interview". Considering that IGA has had numerous playable female characters - including in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodstainedRitualOfTheNight">the first game he did after leaving Konami</a> - it's ridiculous to think he'd say something like that.

During a livestream event to help hype the release of the game Keiji Inafune and his translator were answering questions from fans and hyping the game. When confronted about the problems the game had, Keiji's translator said "It's better than nothing." That statement caused many people to believe that Keiji said that to spite fans, though it was discovered later on that it was the translator who said it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>:

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TobyFox">Toby Fox</a> has never said such a thing on the matter, and has even used the term "Genocide ending" himself.

Despite the post being backed up by screenshots with above-SNES-level resolution and music that was beyond the capabilities of the SNES, fans took it seriously, causing Toby to once again have to deny it on Twitter.

Miyazaki didn't cite it as the primary inspiration, but mentioned it among other sources of inspiration, including other manga such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Devilman">Devilman</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em>, as well as as his collection of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">Tabletop RPGs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyLiterature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyLiterature">Fantasy Literature</a>, the earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FromSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FromSoftware">FromSoftware</a> game series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsField">King's Field</a></em>, and the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FightingFantasy">Fighting Fantasy</a></em> game books.
</li><li> After <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls1">Dark Souls 1</a></em> came out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> The Bed of Chaos was so poorly-received that it was said that Miyazaki had publicly apologised for it being so bad. He actually made no such apology. The closest thing to such a statement is FROM Software saying that they felt that the Lost Izalith area (which contains the Bed of Chaos) was not what it should have been and that they wanted to do more with it, but they'd run out of time.
</li><li> Likewise, Miyazaki wasn't the one who said poise was "working as intended" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em>. That was an unnamed Bandai Namco Spokesperson.

This is based on "answers" section on the first game's homepage <a class="urllink" href="http://www.aksysgames.com/999/answers">specifically, question 25<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However said answer only mentions the first part, the second was merely fan's interpretation. Uchikoshi never said whether <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Junpei will actually find Akane</span> or not after the game's events so what happened in later games was possibility from the start.

<ul><li> There are a lot of fans who adamantly believe that Sonic is "the fastest thing alive" and that nothing else can possibly outrun him. That line came from the opening theme of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicTheHedgehogSatAM">Sonic the Hedgehog (SatAM)</a></em> cartoon, which is a separate canon from any of the video games (except possibly <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicSpinball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicSpinball">Sonic Spinball</a></em>). While Sonic DID ultimately prove unmatched in speed in that TV show, plenty of things can match or exceed his speed in the video games<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note22pmoj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note22pmoj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note22pmoj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To name a few, this includes Dr. Eggman himself, Metal Sonic, the G.U.N. truck, most of the bosses in <em>Sonic Advance 2</em>, Shadow the Hedgehog, Silver the Hedgehog as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em>, all of the daytime bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicUnleashed">Sonic Unleashed</a></em>, the Cyan Wisps, the Extreme Gears, the orca by Emerald Coast, the Kaos wheels in Seaside Hill and Ocean Palace, and the malicious Ferris wheel in Tropical Resort</span>, which invariably causes these fans to get upset whenever they play a Sonic game and see something or someone achieve a speed Sonic cannot reach.
</li><li> One thing that has spread since the release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> is that the Super Emeralds from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sonic3AndKnuckles">Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles</a></em> are no longer around because somehow they were completely drained of their power during the events of <em>&amp; Knuckles</em>. All that was shown in the former game was that seven gray cracked emeralds were around the Master Emerald. The belief was spread so fast that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> had to clarify that the emeralds shown were just stone replicas but you still see this belief in certain areas.

The Japanese Twitter linked to a profile that happened to refer to him being a plumber in the past tense, but this was specifically referencing the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioBros">Mario Bros.</a></em> game, which was one of the few times he's actually done a plumbing job. Several articles reporting on this warped it into "Mario is no longer a plumber!" In response to the misunderstanding, the profile was updated again in 2018. Clearly stating that, yes, Mario <em>is</em> a plumber, but he's not limited to just that.

It confirmed that this was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">original intention</a>, but also specifically confirmed that it was changed during development so that Mario is pointing instead.

Even official confirmation from the head writer, Michael Chu, and the introduction of Moira, an actual evil healer, hasn't done much to stem it. This likely stems from Mercy being surprisingly youthful, in full body armor (minus her face), and the reveal that she turned Genji into a cyborg.

This is stated to have either been mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> in a Japanese art book or implied in the Japanese version. In reality, no mention of this exists in canon. The series implies that Pearl is a member of a naturally small species of squid.
</li><li> A large number of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em> fans believe Dickson's last name is Soss. This odd name came from a vandal edit to his article on the Xenoblade Wiki which stated his last name was revealed in the game's art book or another official Japanese source. This fact went unchecked until a few years after when it was discovered that Dickson's last name is never stated in said book and that no Japanese sites ever bring up the name Soss.

Unfortunately, this false claim hurt the franchise's chances in America.

We don't really feel the past look of Donkey Kong was fresh enough for today. We really gave our new development team the chance to really create something unique and stylish.</em>". Needless to say, the negative implications of the statement were not well received by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry">Donkey Kong Country</a></em> fan, especially as this was after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Rare">Rare</a>'s sale to Microsoft and admist concerns Nintendo would roll back the studio's contributions to the <em>Donkey Kong</em> franchise. However, fans would <a class="urllink" href="https://dkvine.com/?p=news_body&amp;post=5945">revisit the interview<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 2019 and find this was a major mistranslation: the original statement was more tame, simply stating the developers of <em>Jungle Beat</em> focused on a new cast because the game's tone was very different from previous games and they hoped it would reflect the style of the newly-formed EAD Tokyo team.

The creators went on to clarify that Neo would return <em>soon</em> and never gave an actual time period, and that while there were plans for Pyrrha's parents to show up in Volume 3, it ended up being cut. Both of these were addressed in Volume 6, by giving Neo a subplot and spending much of an episode addressing Pyrrha's fate.

Dib being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">artificial</a> creation of Professor Membrane's is an example of the former<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23c7bx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23c7bx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23c7bx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and note that "clone of Membrane" was never specified</span>, Zim being "16 in Irken years" is an example of the latter.
</li><li> Jhonen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBacklash">hating the show</a> and saying that he "would never work in animation ever again" was also a common belief following the show's cancellation. However, he makes appearances at conventions and has repeatedly said how much he enjoyed working on the show due to how much he was allowed to get away with in a Nickelodeon cartoon (the only real <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a> was not allowing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">deaths</a>).

This belief may have stemmed from series director Steve Ressel, who stated that <em>he'd</em> never want to work on the show ever again, and left the animation industry after attempting one more animation project.
</li><li> In the DVD commentary for "Bad, Bad Rubber Piggy" the cast claims that there were plans to kill off Dib and replace him with a new character named Louie. Many fans take this to be serious, though if you listen to the commentary it's pretty clear that this is just playful ribbing.

Possibly people have got confused over the statement that "She hated/didn't hate G1," which could refer to either.
</li><li> Lauren Faust was particularly susceptible to this trope during her time with the show, it seems.

What fans failed to notice was that she was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrugOfGod">just speculating</a> at this, as she additionally noted that if the fans liked Derpy, then the name would remain Derpy.

</li><li> The show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bonkers">Bonkers</a></em> is frequently thought to be a retooled Roger Rabbit TV series, with Bonkers being an expy of Roger due to copyright issues. Greg Weisman, who worked on the series, has repeatedly stated that while Roger Rabbit was an inspiration, it was only that.

</li><li> A persistent rumor states that the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> episode "The Pigeon Man" would've ended with Vincent committing suicide by hurling himself off the building, but was nixed by the higher ups. Show creator Craig Bartlett denies this and says that the ending shown was the intended one from the beginning.

After Hirsch hinted in the behind-the-scenes special <em>Between the Pines</em> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyKnownByTheirNickname">Dipper's</a> real name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTwinNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeTwinNaming">had something in common with Mabel's</a>, one of these screenshots gave rise to a popular rumor that his real name was Michael. Instead, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravityFallsJournal3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GravityFallsJournal3">Gravity Falls: Journal 3</a></em> tells us that it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mason</span>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many fans insist Pearl is canonically a lesbian to "disprove" heterosexual pairings involving the character and accuse shippers of homophobia and lesbian erasure. While the showrunners have confirmed that she has had romantic feelings towards at least two women, and she was explicitly uninterested in the one man who had feelings for her, they never specified her sexuality.
</li><li> The artbook had a joking nod to the theory that fusion is just a metaphor for sex, but made it clear that that fusion actually serves as a much broader metaphor for various kinds of relationships, not just sexual or romantic ones. However, this was quickly warped into the <em>exact opposite</em>, with fans saying that the artbook confirmed the theory.
</li><li> A persistent rumor sprung up after "Alone at Sea", an episode about Jasper trying to get Lapis Lazuli to fuse with her in order to become Malachite again, which becomes a metaphor for toxic relationships, that Lapis is a self-insert of Rebecca Sugar and her experience with an abusive relationship and that Jasper was based on her abuser. This was a conclusion fans made when Sugar said she started drawing her "Margo in Bed" comic after a "bad breakup" and that the eponymous character was a self-insert of herself and a "proto-Lapis." However, she has never disclosed such personal information or even said that Lapis was intended as the victim of the relationship. Rather that Malachite represents an unhealthy, loveless relationship that brings out the worst in people.
</li><li> People who hated the plot twist from "A Single Pale Rose", in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rose Quartz and Pink Diamond turn out to be the same person</span> often say that the crew said they didn't plan past "Ocean Gem" until after the episode aired, often as proof that the writers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockingSwerve">came up with the twist at the last minute</a> and that any quotes to the contrary are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyingCreator">lies</a>. This is incorrect, they <em>actually</em> said they didn't <em>storyboard</em> past "Ocean Gem" until after it aired, and have consistently stated that the aforementioned twist was one of the first plot points thought up about the show.
</li><li> The crew never specifically debunked the theory related to the above twist. What they did say was stuff like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"Her name is Rose QUARTZ"</span>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords">which turned out to be true in the end.</a>

</li><li> It was widely claimed from around 2011 to 2018 that there were plans for a fourth season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>, and that among other things, head writer Aaron Ehasz wanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanPreferredCouple">Zuko and Katara</a> to be the end pairing. Such information allegedly came from a discussion a fan had with him following a panel at some convention. This was later debunked when Ehasz <a class="urllink" href="http://attackfish.tumblr.com/post/178187939941/avatarsymbolism-aaron-ehasz-during-the-dragon">outright<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://attackfish.tumblr.com/post/178189268841/avatarsymbolism-aaron-ehasz-during-the-dragon">said<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on Reddit during a Q&amp;A promoting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince">The Dragon Prince</a></em> that all of this information was fabrication. He even states that he always planned Mai to be Zuko's love interest and cites her as one of his favourite characters he created during the show. He would later state that while he and series creators <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanKonietzko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanKonietzko">Bryan Konietzko</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDanteDiMartino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelDanteDiMartino">Michael Dante DiMartino</a> had floated around ideas for a fourth season, it was decided to stick with the original three season plan; With that in mind, of the ideas that <em>were</em> considered for this fourth season, the major one was <a class="urllink" href="https://twitter.com/aaronehasz/status/1112820340319641600?s=19">an Azula redemption arc<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In the DVD commentary for Book 1 of <em>Korra</em>, the creators revealed that when the show only had one season Asami was going to end up in the United Forces and start a relationship with Zuko's grandson Iroh. They said that when she told Mako, his reply was "The heck, he's like 36!" which has since gotten taken out of context. Iroh is supposed to be a bit older than then 18 year old Asami but not that much older. She would have said she was 22. It's still a pervasive misconception but the discarded joke in context is clearly an exaggeration for comedic effect. The joke is also about Asami <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">looking older than she is</a>, not about Iroh looking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">younger than he is</a>. Iroh also has a sister whose role got cut out of Book 4 (which had a three year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>) due to time constraints. The plan was for her to be Makos love interest, meaning that shes probably in her early twenties like he is. Its unlikely that hes almost two decades older than her and their mother, Firelord Izumi, also doesnt look like shes old enough to have child whos 40.

One day a popular boy asked her to the movies, but he never turned up. Ember stayed up all night waiting for him, which resulted in her sleeping through the freak fire that spread through her home and killed her. This fan-cited backstory has never been sourced.

He called it "descent with modification". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Social Darwinism</a> even has his name tacked on it, even though he was dismayed by his theories being misused in social context, in extremely unscientific ways. Even today people from both sides talk about eugenics like Darwin had anything to do with the practice, which he in fact opposed. When the idea of intentional "improvement" of humanity through selective breeding was first brought up (the term eugenics had yet to be coined), Darwin referred to it as "utopian" (as in impractical or unrealistic). It's also a concept that far predates his time, as it was advocated by Plato in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRepublic">The Republic</a></em> based on ancient Sparta's practice for instance. Selective breeding of plants and animals is as old as agriculture.
</li><li> This caused a stir when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry">Halle Berry</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> page was edited with a quote from her that said "this new album will show people that [she] can do more than act". A number of news websites then reported that Berry was branching out into music, which caused Berry herself to report that she had no plans to do so.
</li><li> With the relaunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VH1">VH1</a> Classic as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MTV">MTV</a> Classic, it has been touted as being a return to MTV's musical roots. Neither Viacom, nor the MTV division itself ever made any such claims.
</li><li> In a famous incident, Christian fundamentalists started burning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">Beatles</a> merchandise when John Lennon's statement about the band being more popular than Jesus Christ was misinterpreted as them being <em>bigger</em> than Christ. Lennon's statement was intended as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to excessive fan worship and he would clarify "I never said we were better than Christ or greater than Christ. I'm just saying we're more popular." To this day, some have yet to be mollified. (Lennon becoming a vocal anti-theist in his later life doesn't help matters here, though he insisted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JesusWasWayCool">he was a big fan of the man personally</a>.)
</li><li> Outside of apocrypha, no one officially connected with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">RMS Titanic</a> ever actually went on record claiming the ship to be literally "unsinkable". The closest official records come is are general suggestions that the ship's safety designs<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2619h9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2619h9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2619h9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which, although ultimately to be proven tragically inadequate, actually <em>were</em> top-notch by the standards of the day</span> made her "practically unsinkable". Later reports naturally dropped the 'practically' in order to sensationalise the tragedy and amp up the situational irony factor.
