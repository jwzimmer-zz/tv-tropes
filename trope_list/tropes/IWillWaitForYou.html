</li><li> A subversion occurs much earlier in the Buggy Arc. In the town Buggy's crew have occupied, there's a little dog called Chou-Chou, who's standing guard at a shop his master founded. Said master went to the hospital several weeks ago and never came back, having died. Most of the townspeople think Chou-Chou's still waiting, but not the mayor, Boodle.

The woman's granddaughter reveals that her husband wanted to leave to become a Pokemon Doctor, but she didn't want to leave because she was pregnant. She wanted to tell him before he left but was unable to catch up to him.

Unlike in American films of this type, they never get back together, not even briefly. Though it's pretty heavily implied that they still both carry the old flame. This film is sort of indirectly the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">Trope Namer</a> — the main musical theme was also adapted into an English song with this title.

Although this time they are only parted for half a year.
<ul><li> It doesn't really come up in the movie, but the backstory given in the book it's revealed that by the time they finally get married, Arwen has been waiting for Aragorn for around 40 years.

It's worth noting that they waited <em>twenty years</em>, and Penelope was besieged by over <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">a hundred</a></em> suitors.

<ul><li> As it turns out, Odysseus arrives just in time. Before he left to go to the Trojan War, he told Penelope to wait until their son Telemachus came of age and into his inheritance as the new king of Ithaca and that she should then marry the best husband she could find. At the beginning of the Odyssey, Telemachus declares that he is old enough to become head of the household and ruler of the kingdom in his mother's stead. Penelope then does what she can to postpone the potential wedding, but eventually she can delay no longer. The day Odysseus arrives home is the day before she was to be forced to choose a suitor.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LMMontgomery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LMMontgomery">L. M. Montgomery</a> really liked this one and featured it in several stories, usually with a man coming back to meet a woman he knew years ago and finding her still there. The story just about always had a happy ending.

In the end, he does come back.
<ul><li> In the same book, Rilla Blythe waits for her childhood sweetheart to come back. It's a striking example because of her young age: she was only about 14 when the war began; by the time the book ends, she's an adult.

Slightly subverted since she too has been sentenced to make penance and spends twenty years at a convent, but it kicks in for real once she's done her time and has to wait to see if he will ever return home.

They fall in love via this correspondence (though by no means a wholesome love) and Vlad becomes determined to circumvent mortality, no matter how many years he has to wait before he can finally see Elizabeth face to face. Elizabeth is more realistic about the matter and advises him not to hold his breath.

</li><li> In <em>Faithful Jenny Dove</em>, the titular Jenny promises to wait for her lover, naturally he dies and she wastes away herself but keeps on waiting as a ghost.

The last stanza is a prime example of this trope:
<div class="indent"><em>"Though waters wide between us glide, <br/>Our lives are warm and near: <br/>No distance parts two faithful hearts— <br/>Two hearts that love so dear: <br/>And I will trust my sailor-lad, <br/>For ever and a day, <br/>To think of me—to think of me— <br/>When he is far away!"</em>

In the second series, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Graystripe is captured by Twolegs</span> and the Clans leave the forest for good to find a new home, Firestar refuses to give up hope that Graystripe will return, leaving the deputy position open, even though most of the cats believe that Graystripe is dead.

<ul><li> The Atlantic Canadian folk song "Dark-Eyed Sailor" has the same setup.

The singer finally promises this after she dies.
</li><li> In the song "Penelope", the protagonist goes to the train station every day to wait for her beloved. She gets old and finally the guy comes and thanks her for being so faithful and that his wait is over, she only looks at him and says "No you don't look like he use to look (of course not, he is old now) you aren't him! and goes on waiting. (Gee, if the guy was alive all this time... couldn't he write or something?) The song is also in Spanish, notice a pattern here?
</li><li> Although the promise is never made, "Travelin' Soldier" by the Dixie Chicks hardily applied this trope. He meets her the day he's shipped off for the military, ends up sending her letters. She breaks down crying when she hears his name on a list of Vietnam dead at a high school game.

He ends up moving on and starting a family of his own, but is left wondering "what if".
<ul><li> The folk song "Youth of the Heart" deals with a similar situation. The narrator spent years saving up enough money to support his sweetheart as he felt she deserved then went home only to discover that she'd gotten fed up with waiting and married another, poorer man that very morning.

His mother assumes that the fact that his fiancee Ann hasn't married somebody else means she's waiting for him and uses this to validate her belief that he's alive.

</li><li> And of course <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fala_(dog)">Fala<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, FDR's beloved Scottish Terrier. Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in her autobiography about Fala's waiting: "Fala accepted me after my husband's death, but I was just someone to put up with until the master should return."
</li></ul></li><li> Lady Jane Franklin never gave up hope that members (and hopefully her husband Sir John) of the ill-fated Franklin Northwest Passage Expedition would be found alive until near the end of her life.
</li><li> Under traditional Jewish law, this can happen involuntarily to wives who are abandoned by their husbands (or whose husbands simply vanish). A divorce is only valid if the husband signs it, and there's no "legally dead" clause — a woman is not a widow unless there are <em>witnesses</em> to her husband's death. If a husband simply vanished, his wife would be considered legally married to him, and unable to marry anyone else. The descriptive term for such a woman is "agunah", meaning "chained". <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0q82q');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0q82q" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0q82q');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The same applies if the husband doesn't vanish, but simply moves out and refuses to support or divorce her.</span> The custom was that if a man went into a dangerous situation where he might vanish without a trace — for example, fighting in war or sailing the sea — he would leave behind a signed certificate of divorce, which could be delivered to his wife if he were lost for a long enough period. Presumably these soldiers/sailors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">wanted their beloved to be happy</a>.
<ul><li> They also wanted them to be provided for. A widow at least had the protection of the laws of redemption and levirate marriage, but if her husband was MIA, he wouldn't be around to support her, nor could she fall back on her kinsman redeemer.
</li><li> It's worth noting that if a man did return after the bill of divorce was delivered and she had already remarried, he could never marry her again, not even if her second husband died. That is the gravity of invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">I Want My Beloved to Be Happy</a> in this situation.
