Who "they" are is a mystery, but they are (occasionally) wrong. In reality, many people fall in love a second, third, or even fourth time. Despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstGirlWins">First Girl Wins</a> trope, there are many cases when the second girl (not necessarily <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastGirlWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastGirlWins">Last Girl</a>) ends up with the guy. This happens with the guy as well, but not as often. This is not to say that first love can't ever work out, this trope applies to when the first love does not work out and is relevant.
</p><p>Reasons for the first love not working out vary. The person may have cheated on their significant other, turned evil, or even died. Widowing is popular, as it allows the old love interest to be "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfTheHypotenuse">out of the way</a>" without ruining the dignity or reputation of either of the pair (especially if the deceased is played up as having been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a>). Often, for added tension, the first and second loves know each other, or may have been sworn enemies. In some more supernatural cases, the second love happens <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerReplacementLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoppelgangerReplacementLoveInterest">to look exactly like the first one.</a>

But unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CasanovaWannabe">Casanova Wannabe</a> and even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalrousPervert">Chivalrous Pervert</a>, they definitely felt something for the first love.

This would haunt Issei for some time before realizing that he's in love with his master Rias Gremory.

At some unknown point, they split up for good and Bulma ends up having a family with Vegeta.

However, while Kagome and Kikyou are two different women, Kagome is Kikyou's reincarnated soul. Her very existence is the result of Kikyou's lingering desire to meet Inuyasha again.

</li><li> Chandler was Monica's third love; her first love was Richard and her second love was Pete.

The same arguably goes for a City Elf (of either gender), who was betrothed prior to becoming a Grey Warden, and a Dalish elf, if the player chose dialogue options that suggested s/he was in love with their hunting partner Tamlen. Additionally, the player can help Oghren win over his second love following the death of his first wife, Branka; if his approval of the Warden is high enough, he asks them to accompany him on a visit to old flame Felsi, whom he can end up marrying if the mission is a success.

The Sheikah scientist Robbie also has one with his current wife Jerrin.

</li><li> Lilly had a crush on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her English tutor</span>, but never acted on it.

She left to join the military right after graduation, and when they finally meet again twelve years later as captain and first officer of the Sunrider, Ava is determined not to renew their relationship on the grounds that it could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InappropriatelyCloseComrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InappropriatelyCloseComrades">compromise their judgment</a>.

In the good endings, Chigara even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy">gives Kayto her blessing to be with his new</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> since she herself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is being held indefinitely in solitary confinement to prevent her from causing trouble if the Prototypes take control of her again</span>.

She gave birth to a daughter, Yang Xiao Long, but then Raven disappeared shortly thereafter. Taiyang then fell for his other teammate, Summer Rose, and she raised Yang as her own even as she and Taiyang had their own daughter, Ruby Rose. It wasn't until Summer disappeared as well that Yang found out about all this—she had thought Summer was her biological mother for most of her childhood.
