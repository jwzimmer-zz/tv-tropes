This character might learn the local language fluently just by chatting while playing cards each evening for a few weeks, or perhaps due to having taken evening classes for a month when they were twenty years younger, they are able to win debates on metaphysics in a particular language. At the very least, they read the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBookClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBookClub">Genius Book Club</a> books in the original language, even if that language is a <em>dead</em> language.
</p><p>Sometimes there may be justification for this  perhaps it's a superpower, perhaps the character is immortal (and thus had the time to learn the languages the regular way) or perhaps they had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpgradeArtifact">Upgrade Artifact</a>. Sure, some people genuinely are good at languages, but sometimes it shows a lack of research  the author is not aware that learning a foreign language properly can be quite difficult and time-consuming (perhaps because the author has never properly attempted to learn a second language himself).

</p><p>The fact that young children are better at learning languages than older children, adults, or teenagers makes this trope easier to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> if the character in question was either A) raised in a highly multilingual environment or B) a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildProdigy">Child Prodigy</a> who learned languages for fun when they were four years old.

<ul><li> L from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em> can speak enough languages to communicate with police all over the globe. He knows basically everything. He's the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">three</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatDetective">greatest detectives</a> in the world.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em> speaks or at least gets by in any language the gang encounters in their heists. This includes several <em>computer</em> languages.
</li><li> Johan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> speaks French, German, English, and Czech, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleKnowLatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmartPeopleKnowLatin">Latin</a>. He learned most of those while still a fairly young child.
</li><li> Kirika Yumura of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noir">Noir</a></em> is supposed to be fluent in multiple languages, presumably so that she could make herself understood in any region she is trying to track down and kill someone in. However, since the anime auto-translates for the viewer, this is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility">Informed Ability</a>, and the exact languages she knows are never explicitly stated.
</li><li> One of the abilities that a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Campione" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Campione">Campione!</a></em> has is that they pick up and speak any language whatsoever. Kind of boring for the standards of this series, but very useful for the protagonist Godou.
</li><li> Sora in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/NoGameNoLife">No Game No Life</a></em> knows a few languages but not enough for this trope. His sister Shiro, on the other hand, knows <em>18</em> languages including their classical versions. This is topped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Flügel</a> Jibril who states to know <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">700</a></em> languages and it's a plot point as well since the fact she has never seen Japanese script confirms the claim of Shiro and Sora that they weren't born in Disboard.
</li><li> Rock from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em> knows a lot of languages to the point where you wonder when a simple salaryman like him found the time to study them. Besides his native Japanese and English being the <em>lingua franca</em> of Roanapur, he also translated the Lovelace family creed while Roberta was reciting it in Spanish, he correctly identified the terms of affection that Hansel and Gretel used as Romanian, and he was able to translate Feng Yifei's Mandarin for Revy's benefit. Though it's mentioned at one point he worked in procurement and likely came in contact with several languages.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaheDetectiveClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaheDetectiveClub">Cahe Detective Club</a></em>, Risa reveals that her ability to speak English well is less from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamerChick">Gamer Chick</a> and more from having a family that globe-trots from time to time. She also explains she can speak Spanish, Italian, and French.
</li><li> Shuu Tsukiyama from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</a></em> is prone to gratuitous foreign words, leaving many fans wondering where he even knew what he was saying. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusMaterial">his father's diary</a> reveals that he's a prodigy that took an interest in foreign languages at a young age because of his father's work. As the heir to an international business conglomerate, it makes sense for him to have a grasp of numerous languages. Besides his native Japanese, he's spoken English, French, Italian, and Spanish. This trope comes into play, however, when he reveals that he's fluent in German when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">responding to Kanae's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingDeclarationOfLove">Dying Declaration of Love</a></span>.
</li><li> Fujiwara of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em> is the daughter of a diplomat, so she's fluent in five languages (the exact languages are never specified outside of Japanese and French, though one of them is probably German due to her love of board games). Ironically, she sucks when it comes to her native Japanese (the official fanbook even lists it as her worst subject) since she spent so much time speaking other languages as a child that her fluency atrophied.
</li><li> Devils in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HighSchoolDXD">High School D×D</a></em> have the ability Language, which allows them to verbally communicate in any language. After reincarnating as a devil, Issei finds himself having to make deliberate mistakes in his English classes to avoid suspicion on how he suddenly became fluent.
</li><li> The Pillar Men from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventure">Jojos Bizarre Adventure</a></em> <em>Part II: Battle Tendency</em> can pick up skills and knowledge extremely quickly. This includes language. They only have to listen to a few sentences (and in the case of the stronger and smarter ones a few <em>words</em>) to become fluent.
</li><li> This is a job requirement for shinobi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoShinobiSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoShinobiSquad">Tokyo Shinobi Squad</a></em>. Due to Japan's globalization efforts, Tokyo has become a hub of international business and crime, forcing shinobi to learn multiple languages to get more clients. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Jin</a> already knows 23 languages, including Japanese, Thai, Italian, French, German, Tagalog, and Arabic, and his teammate Papillon is implied to know even more.
</li><li> Dragons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MissKobayashisDragonMaid">Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid</a></em> can learn languages very quickly (though it's not specified if it's due to magic or an inborn talent). Kanna is seen picking up English during a trip to New York City by just listening to people in a crowd talking for a few seconds.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Wolverine">Wolverine</a> speaks 12 languages fluently and a couple others pretty well, including at least one extraterrestrial language. This is the same man who does not know his own real name and is prone to memory loss. Though he's also over a century old and a world traveler for most of that time, and brainwashing might be involved.
<ul><li> His nemesis, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Sabretooth">Sabretooth</a></em> seems to have this, but possibly to a lesser extent. It's never been stated how many different languages he knows. He's spoken to Omega Red in Russian. Given his many travels there, he may also speak German, and has been shown to be able to fluently converse with Somalians in their native African language.
</li></ul></li><li> In several continuities innate knowledge of all languages on Earth is one of the powers granted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman">Wonder Woman</a>, and in all continuities, she knows a vast number of languages and is supernaturally good at picking up new ones no matter their planet of origin.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> can speak English, German, Russian, Spanish, Japanese, French and Italian. There might be even more that he is lingual in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KittyPryde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KittyPryde">Shadowcat</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> also speaks a wide number of languages. Kitty herself knows fluent royal and standard Shi'ar and has some moderate knowledge of Gaelic, Hebrew, and German. When Illyana Rasputin came to stay with the team, Xavier telepathically taught them all fluent Russian, and when the team went to Japan for Wolverine's wedding to Mariko Yashida, he likewise taught them Japanese.
<ul><li> Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatonicLifePartners">Platonic Life Partner</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightcrawler">Nightcrawler</a> is similarly gifted. Justified in that he spent his youth traveling around Europe as the star performer in a circus and knowing the language of wherever they were that week was very handy. Aside from the Russian and Japanese everyone learned he also speaks German (his native language) English, French (which he also <em>teaches</em>), Spanish, and Italian.
</li><li> Shadowcat's pet dragon Lockheed knows more languages than Beast, even though everyone treats him as a quote-unquote "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParisHilton">starlet's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterMuffykins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisterMuffykins">chihuahua</a>", as Abigail Brand put it. He's less a pet dragon as he is from a race of insect-like highly advanced aliens. He now teaches at the Xavier Institute.
</li><li> The <em>X-Men</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Spinoff">spinoff</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a></em> featured the character Doug Ramsey/'Cypher' whose power was to do this with <em>any</em> language, even if it should have been completely incomprehensible to the human mind. This extended even to raw computer binaries, dead written languages for which no "Rosetta stone" exists, and an alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishLanguage">Starfish Language</a>.
</li><li> As of the <em>Necrosha</em> arc, in which he was resurrected and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">insane</a>, he became capable of doing this with <em>body</em> language as well. His first appearance involved reading all of the unspoken parts of a reunion between the New Mutants and Xavier, and he later used it to hand them their asses in a fight. Though this only works when they're of their own minds. When Karma took control of the entire team, he could no longer predict what they would do.
</li></ul></li><li> While we're on the X-men, Xavier himself can psychically learn any language by reading the mind of a fluent speaker. Presumably he knows quite a few of them.
<ul><li> One of the benefits of having so many telepaths running around the various teams of X-Men is that they've mastered how to hit field operatives with short-duration language programming, mostly by reading the minds of people in the area they're visiting. Recent examples have included teaching Frenzy several local African dialects; programming the entire field team with local customs and languages when they visited a spaceship graveyard in Indonesia; and Cyclops becoming fully fluent in Cantonese for a couple of weeks when the team undertook a mission in Hong Kong. Xavier is also responsible for teaching Illyana Rasputin fluent English over the course of a single night by programming it into her brain while she slept.

The only exception, strangely enough, is Robert Langdon (you'd think a historian would know a few European languages to be able to read primary historical sources), and his inability to speak French or Italian would go on to bite him in the ass quite a few times.

Some of which she studied as a child, sure, but she picked up a lot more in conversation in the course of traveling through many countries. Her foster-son Imriel is nearly as adept at learning languages.
<ul><li> Imriel's a much more realistic example. While Phedre's gift for languages is remarkable to the point that it's lampshaded a few times, Imriel learns to make himself understood in a variety of languages because he spent months in an environment that spoke many different languages interchangeably. After he returns to Terre D'Ange, he rarely uses any language besides D'Angeline, and as a result loses most of what he learned as a child.

</li></ul></li><li> Evan Tanner, the "sort-of" spy in Lawrence Block's <em>The Thief Who Couldn't Sleep</em> series, had his "sleep center" destroyed by a piece of shrapnel in the Korean War. This means he never has to sleep again, so he learns as many languages as he can through Berlitz tapes (to help with his globe-trotting espionage activities.)
</li><li> The eponymous character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmbertoEco" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/UmbertoEco">Baudolino</a></em> is able to learn any language incredibly quickly.

<ul><li> Savage's cousin (again, according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipJoseFarmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipJoseFarmer">Farmer</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Tarzan">Tarzan</a> can barely speak English in the movies; thus, most people who saw the pictures first are surprised to learn that in the books he speaks a variety of languages, including at least one non-human one (Ape or "Mangani" — his "native tongue"). His talent in this area may exceed Doc's; by the end of the second book, after only a year or so around other humans he has mastered French, English, Arabic, and the language of his adopted African tribe, Waziri, roughly in that order.

<ul><li> The fishing boat example isn't due to the complexity of the language, but the fact that most speakers of Basic don't know how to make that soft (unaspirated) "p" sound. Presumably Basic, like English, usually has a puff of air accompany the "p" sound. This isn't part of the language but simply how it's spoken. The Chiss language, however, uses both as different phonemes.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note35k4f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note35k4f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note35k4f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> As do some Earth languages, in fact.</span> Car'das was so used to Basic that, try as he might, he couldn't make that soft "p" when the language called for it.

His cradle tongue was Irish, but by 15 he had forgotten it; by the second book he can subconsciously understand the Irish-speaking mutineers, and by the fourth he is writing political propaganda. In the rest of the books, he is fluent again.

Baloo knows them because he's old, wise, and accepted everywhere, and he teaches Mowgli them because being a "mancub" means that nobody will accept his presence at all unless he learns their language. Mowgli eventually one-ups Baloo by adding the Indian human tongue to his list.

Yoko Akia is quite fluent in Chinese as the book <em>Vendetta</em> shows, <em>Free Fall</em> indicates that she can speak Japanese, but she states in <em>Hide And Seek</em> that she can't speak German, because it's so gutteral and too hard on her tongue. After the book <em>Free Fall</em>, the Vigilantes are required to learn Spanish and German. Despite this, Isabelle Flanders is unable to speak Spanish very well in <em>Cross Roads</em>. The book <em>Fast Track</em> has the Vigilantes finding out that Rena Gold speaks three languages, but they just scoff and one of them says, "Yeah! Fluent in Brooklynese, Southern belle, and kitchey-coo!" Harry Wong apparently knows a lot of languages, but it is never stated what they are or how many he knows, and it seems that he just uses them for cursing and showing that he is beyond furious.

When the main character, Abby, finally travels back in time, to Italy, she learns that her gift is Language — no need to learn Italian. while this is handy, even more handy is the fact that not only does it apply to "regular" languages, it applies to the language of <em>Time itself</em>.

This hardly surprising, considering his life as both as a traveling mercenary (requiring him to learn the local tongue, wherever "local" happens to be) and as Company annalist (requiring him to read from the Company's history, meaning he needs to know how to read the older volumes that were written in different/archaic languages).

</li><li> In <em>The Fated Sky</em> (Book two of The Lady Astronaut series), it's revealed that Stetson Parker has an ear for languages, and makes it a point to learn every language of the thirteen other astronauts on his voyage to Mars. Due to Elma's late addition to the crew, he does not speak Yiddish, but is eager enough to learn it that he will temporarily bury the hatchet he and Elma bear in order to learn more.

It should be noted though, any viewer who can actually understand the languages in question should be able to tell that her pronunciation is <em>atrocious</em>, to say the least.

In one episode, he pretends to be an ex-KGB agent trying to recruit a South American communist sympathizer. Naturally, he uses Russian, with the fact that neither of them is a native Russian hiding his American accent. However, the sympathizer's Russian is a little rusty, so he asks if they can switch to Spanish. Cue Michael's horrified expression, but he manages to recover by asking to switch to English, which the other man knows as well.

</li><li> Then there's Prentiss's replacement, <em>linguist</em> Alex Blake. Though she only demonstrates English and American Sign Language, she's shown to at least understand written French (and recognize the dialect as creole, rather than just French) and German and the International Phonetic Alphabet. Her academic focus seems to be more on English itself, though the one class we see her teaching has her discussing variation and pidgin languages.

<div class="indent"><strong>The Doctor:</strong> And really, you should call her "mummy" not "big milk thing".

Though he can't speak much of Mandarin, he can only count to ten, say hello and say "your daughter is pregnant." The Japanese is justified — his father was in the military and he spent part of his childhood on Okinawa. He can also ask if one's sister is of legal age in Korean. He could also correctly guess that Chase's father is of Czech origin just from his accent. Joked about by other characters: <em>"Do you actually speak six languages, or were you betting on never being interviewed by someone who does?"</em>

<ul><li> And let's not forget the events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stargate">the movie</a>, in which Daniel picks up a new language not even vaguely resembling any modern language to the point of fluency just by talking to one woman for a little while. Justified in that the language was extremely similar to Ancient Egyptian, which Jackson, being an archeologist specializing in Egypt, was very familiar with (the woman in question was pointing out hieroglyphics, which he could read, and teaching him how to pronounce the words).
</li><li> Although the series has long-divorced the movie, the beginning of the movie balances out Jackson's prowess. He had remarkable linguistic skills and anthropological knowledge but implied to be at the cost of an unstable social and financial existence (to say nothing of his allergies and lack of physical prowess).

</li></ul><ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Vikings">Vikings</a></em>, due to his background as a Catholic monk and scribe, Athelstan has a fluent or working knowledge of several languages, including Old English, Latin, Greek, Old Norse, and probably High German because of his time in Charlemagne's court. He's also shown to have a natural gift for picking up dialects. It was this demonstrated ability that initially caught Ragnar's attention and resulted in him sparing Athelstan's life.
</li><li> Neal on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhiteCollar">White Collar</a></em> speaks French, Japanese, and he may also speak German — he can at least read it (Diana needed a German-English dictionary to translate the manifest; Neal just read the titles right off the page). In fact, one episode confirms that Neal speaks eight languages, including some conversational Swahili.
</li><li> The language skills of Indiana Jones mentioned above were also illustrated in the television series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YoungIndianaJones">Young Indiana Jones</a></em>. Indy is about eight and meets one of the locals, also about the same age. They start by giving each other a counting lesson and by the end of the day Indiana up to conversational fluency in the language, to the mild amusement of his parents (there is no mention of his new friend's proficiency in English).

However, besides his role as an iconic criminal genius, according to the backstory given in <em>Hannibal Rising</em>, which overlaps with World War Two, he was a Lithuanian by birth who was orphaned by Nazis, spent part of his childhood in a Russian orphanage, was taken out of there by a family member living in France, became close to a Japanese woman, burned his bridges while actively seeking out the aforementioned Nazis, and traveled to North America; besides this, he's been depicted as having an interest in Italy as an adult, and in the series, he had actually lived there.

The merit does not extend to understanding written texts. But it is a common trait, not restricted to mages only, and thus very useful when combined with merits like <em>Widely Travelled</em>.

<ul><li> In 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, the Lillendi are able to speak any language perfectly, including non-languages like Dabus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebusBubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebusBubble">Rebus Bubbles</a> and Scramblespeak. But then, they're spirits of creativity, and this is explicitly a super-power granted by their deity. We also never find out whether it would work on codes and ciphers, or what would happen if a Lillend was faced with a page of randomly generated nonsense.
</li><li> 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition also ties the number of languages a PC can know to their Intelligence stat; with average Intelligence, a character can have fluency in 2 languages. A perfect 18 Intelligence grants you an impressive 7 languages.
</li><li> In 3.5 Edition, multilingualism is extremely easy. Characters start out fluent in a number of extra languages proportional to their intelligence, and just one skill point enables them to read, write and speak an entire new language. On top of that, the "Master Linguist" feat lets them learn one new language whenever they gain a level.
<ul><li> The spell "Tongues" makes its target fluent in all languages for a few minutes and can be made permanent with more powerful magic.
</li><li> High-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorMonk">Monks</a> gain the "Tongue of the Sun and Moon", allowing them to speak to any living creature whatsoever.

</li></ul></li><li> In 4<sup>th</sup> edition, learning languages is restricted to a feat, Linguist, that requires above-average intelligence, but that feat instantly grants fluency in three new languages of the player's choice. Since a character can exchange one previously acquired feat upon gaining a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">level</a>, they can spontaneously learn Draconic, Primordial, and Abyssal by forgetting Elven, Dwarven, and Goblin. It helps that core 4e only has 10 languages and every character starts out knowing at least 2.
</li><li> 5<sup>th</sup> edition also provides the Linguist feat, though without the high intelligence requisite - anyone can just learn 3 extra languages! Though as 5e contains 16 core languages this is probably a necessity.
<ul><li> Spells such as Comprehend Languages and Speak With Animals temporarily extend a character's linguistic abilities, while Monk ability Tongue of the Sun and Moon shows that the character is so in touch with people's energies they can understand all speech, and be understood in turn.
</li><li> The Warlock eldritch Invocation Eyes of the Runekeeper gives the Warlock a variant. They can read any language (including extinct ones), but cannot recreate them, so if they want to write or speak the languages themselves, they have to do it the old way.

<ul><li> Learning languages is incentivized by merging its skill with the skills for forging documents and deciphering coded, incomplete, or archaic texts. Becoming incrementally better at either of the latter automatically comes with a side of fluency in a new language.
</li><li> A canonical example of an omniglot is Ezren Zefiir, the Iconic Wizard. In his pre-generated statblocks, he's fluent in six languages at level 1,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note572b5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note572b5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note572b5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Common, Draconic, Goblin, Infernal, Osiriani, and Terran</span> thirteen at level 7<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6m64e');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6m64e" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6m64e');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">All of the former, plus Abyssal, Celestial, Elven, Giant, Ignan, Infernal, Kelish, and Undercommon</span> and twenty languages, one of them a long-dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassicalTongue">Classical Tongue</a>, at level 12.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7drdu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7drdu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7drdu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Adding Aklo, Aquan, Auran, Azlanti, Dwarven, Gnoll, and Orc</span>
</li><li> Many celestial beings have the power of "Truespeech", which any non-mindless being hears as their own native language or form of communication, and which lets the celestial understand all forms of communication.
</li><li> Aasimar (people with celestial beings in their ancestry) have the alternate racial trait of Truespeaker, representing them being able to tap into a measure of celestial Truespeech. It allows them to learn <em>two</em> languages whenever they take a rank in Linguistics (the language skill).
</li></ul></li><li> There's actually a trait for it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em> called Hyper Linguist — it reduces the time and cost to learn Language skills to one-third, lets your character automatically learn a language through a single day of complete immersion, and grants a + 10 modifier to interpreting languages they don't know. Given that you need 50 points in a language skill to be fluent, and you normally require one Rez Point per skill point and one week of studying per point, plus you're restricted to 5 points in a skill per month, this is <strong>very</strong> handy if you're not planning to rely on your Muse's translation program for communication. It can also be varying degrees of justified, as your character can be anything from a custom-programmed AI to a centuries-old world-weary immortal, and it's available as a fairly cheap Biomod though that doesn't transfer when you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodySurf">Body Surf</a> like the trait.
<ul><li> There's also the Pattern Recognition <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psi-slight</a>, which gives a + 20 modifier to interpreting any human language that they have had a few hours of exposure too, but can't automatically learn the language and only reduces training time by half. But it can be used to interpret alien languages as well, Hyper Linguist only works with human languages, and given a week or so can crack most ciphers. It also costs half as much, assuming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">slightly insane</a> prerequisites are already met.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> has Linguistics Charms that produce various effects of this type, ranging from "You pick up the language temporarily after listening to it for a few minutes" to "Your body language cuts through the linguistic barrier." Also, as with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant">Aberrant</a></em> above (it's the same basic system), every point in Linguistics gives you a language family. For some context on that, the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages">Indo-European language family<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> includes everything from English to Russian to Gaelic to Hindi, and there's no reason to think Creation's language families are any less diverse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSSupers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPSSupers">GURPS Supers</a> has an advantage called Omnilingual. You don't actually know every language but every time you encounter a new one (no matter how absurdly obscure) you get to make a skill roll to see if you just happened to study it.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> basic set has Language Talent advantage. In Third Edition, when paired with high intelligence, this made it possible for a character to learn 20 languages or more for just a handful of points. Fourth Edition changed the way languages worked in the game, making Language Talent a much milder advantage.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em> has the Language skill — for every rank, you speak an extra language. One Power Point at character creation gives you four skill points, so for one point, you can know five languages (the native one's free). Fans and some later books have tried to devise ways to make it a little closer to reality. A standard "fix" is to make each language cost two points instead: one to speak, and another to be literate. Although that ratio seems less impressive in a system where one point can also let you breathe in space or casually stroll at 10 MPH and two points lets you speak and understand all languages for every species everywhere.
</li><li> One of the Epic Intelligence Knacks in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em> is Language Mastery — if you listen to a language for a few minutes, you'll speak it with complete fluency. There is a drawback: you can also write that language, but you don't gain automatic mastery of how it's <em>spelled</em>.
</li><li> One fan-made adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> to the D20 system had a game balance error that allowed a starting Elf character with a halfway decent Intelligence to read and write every language ever spoken in the history of the human race (as well as Sperethiel (Elvish) and Or'zet (Orkish)).
</li><li> Fourth-edition <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a></em> has the Linguist quality, which raises all knowledge skills the player has ranks in by two ranks, and the Linguistics Adept power, allowing an Adept to make an ability check to learn a language at skill rank one after being exposed to it for several hours. A character designed for the purpose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">can fly to any city in the world, spend four or five hours wandering around on the streets, and come back fluent in anything short of technical subjects in the local language essentially for free</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SpiritOfTheCentury">Spirit of the Century</a></em> makes no pretenses toward being realistic in this area. A character can speak a number of additional languages equal to their Academics skill (maximum of + 5 for player characters), however, the player does not need to choose their languages up front. Rather, these are considered language "slots" which can be filled as is convenient. This effectively makes any character with decent academics an Omniglot until they run out of language slots, as they can just fill in whatever languages they encounter. The "Linguist" stunt adds an extra 5 language slots, and the "Gift of Tongues" stunt takes this a step further. Any character with this stunt can speak <em>any</em> mainstream language by default and can spend their normal language slots on esoteric languages they have no business ever having learned.

</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spycraft">Spycraft</a></em> tries to make this an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreakFromReality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableBreakFromReality">Acceptable Break from Reality</a>, and does so pretty decently; you're considered fluent in all the major languages in your area, and you can add them as you increase a skill (but in 4-rank increments) by area. However, you can only gain a passing familiarity with most languages in the area, and can only communicate with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">communication check</a>. A character native to North America is presumed fluent in English, for example.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> describe the Kroot as extremely gifted in language due to their natural mimicry, making them able to pick up and speak almost any language with fluency in a matter of months. They can apparently even pick up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> and Tau language, which most humans can't speak due to exacting pronunciation. Most Kroot (except their leaders, who must be able to read the employment contracts) are illiterate on top of it and usually can't write any of the languages they may be able to speak.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WhiteWolf">White Wolf</a></em> has the Linguistics skill. In early editions of their games, each rank in that skill (up to five) gained you one additional language. Eventually, the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWritersAreAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWritersAreAmerican">writers</a> realized that this wasn't nearly epic enough compared to the rest of the games, so now each dot <em>doubles</em> the number of languages you speak. A skill level of five was supposed to represent top human ability, and knowing sixteen additional languages is about right looking at the Real Life section below.
<ul><li> As a funny side note: in the original rules of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em>, it was necessary to be a reasonably low-generation vampire (which is to say, a vampire who's only a few generations removed from Caine, the first vampire; the lower the generation, the stronger their blood) in order to get an attribute or ability score above five points. The old "Murphy's Law" comic strip/column, which highlighted fun errors and oversights in various games' rules systems, pointed out that this meant that in the World of Darkness, anyone who speaks more than six languages — such as, say, most of the people who work at the translation department at the United Nations — is, by the game's rules, at <em>least</em> a seventh-generation vampire. This may not have been specifically why White Wolf changed how Linguistics worked, but it could not have helped.
</li><li> The trope itself gets parodied in some of the flavor text describing the Linguistic skill in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Adventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Adventure">Adventure</a>!,</em> when it turns out the team Omniglot... isn't. Sure, he speaks six dialects of Sumerian, but that doesn't mean he speaks <em>Spanish.</em>
<ul><li> The Jack of All Tongues Knack plays it straight: you double the number of languages you know, and it costs half as much to learn new languages.
</li></ul></li><li> They also veered too hard in the <em>other</em> direction initially in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a></em>. Each language you knew besides your native language was a separate one-to-three-dot merit, and you required two dots to be literate and conversationally fluent — one dot meant you were minimally fluent and illiterate. For reference, this means that it took nearly a third of a character's starting merit dots to be able to read and speak an additional language, and it cost as much in merit dots or experience as having an intuitive sense of impending danger or being a relatively significant celebrity. They quickly rewrote it in the errata so it now acts as the original version of the Linguistics skill, except as a merit.
<ul><li> And the rules update from <em>The God Machine Chronicle</em> splits the difference — there's now Language and Multilingual. Both are one dot, but Language is complete fluency in a single language, while Multilingual is reasonable spoken fluency and a roll to understand writing for two languages.
</li></ul></li><li> A bunch of the game lines likewise have powers that take care of this. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">Werewolf: The Forsaken</a></em> has at least three language-derived Gifts, ranging from "you instantly pick up the native language" to "you can understand what anyone says, but you can't converse back." <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em> has Mind rotes that let you blow past the language barrier. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Promethean: The Created</a></em> has Transmutations that allow a Promethean to translate any written language and speak in a tongue that everyone understands. And <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ChangelingTheLost">Changeling: The Lost</a></em> has a Merit that allows a changeling to temporarily draw upon a language by using the Wyrd to draw upon the collective unconscious.
</li><li> If you have demons in your DNA (whatever that means), you can learn an infernal power, Tongue of Babel, that allows you to comprehend and speak any language, permanently.
<ul><li> And then there are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DemonTheDescent">other demons</a>, who have the innate ability to speak any language that is considered a "living language" by the denizens of the world, be they mundane or supernatural. So demons can speak the First Tongue of the spirit world but are SOL when it comes to Latin or Akkadian. This often plays a heavy role in demon SIGINT, with the Unchained sending messages back and forth in Tagalog, Urdu, or whatever is unlikely to be translated if intercepted in their local area.

He has the ability "Gift of Tongues", which lets him speak any language anywhere. He uses this to deliver the most heinous insults possible to his enemies; in game terms, if he issues a challenge to another character, they <em>cannot</em> refuse, because they're too pissed off by his insults to back down.

Japanese, English, Korean, Chinese, Portuguese, and Spanish at least.

If you pick the soldier background, the e-mail describing Mike says he picked up Arabic during his tour of duty in Iraq, just by interacting with native speakers. He apparently speaks the language at a fluent level, as well as being capable of understanding and conversing in Russian, Italian and Mandarin Chinese with no apparent difficulty. Technical specialist Mike, meanwhile, has a PhD in linguistics and is outright stated to know English, Farsi, Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Mandarin (Chinese) and Japanese.

</li><li> Out of all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seiyuu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seiyuu">seiyuus</a> out there, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaKakihara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TetsuyaKakihara">Tetsuya Kakihara</a> is the only one who's known to be able to speak <em>five</em> languages and those are Japanese, German, English, Spanish, and Latin.
</li><li> Sir Richard Francis Burton, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Genius Bruiser</a> that he was, spoke 29 European, African and Asian languages.
</li><li> Polish-Russian linguist Jan Niecisław Ignacy Baudouin de Courtenay (AKA Ivan Nikolaevich Baudouin de Courtenay) knew 92 languages with reasonable fluency and reportedly had some understanding of several dozens more. There's a rumor that he once said that learning a language is only difficult if you're doing it second or third time, once you know five, learning one more is a breeze.
</li><li> If you are curious why American voice actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuriLowenthal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/YuriLowenthal">Yuri Lowenthal</a> averts the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenBotheringWithTheAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenBotheringWithTheAccent">Not Even Bothering with the Accent</a>, this is mainly because he's fluent in Japanese, German, and French (as well as English obviously). This allows him to pull off a wide range of accents (including Russian, even though he doesn't speak the language). He jokes about how the only Spanish he knows involves ordering from Mexican restaurants.
</li><li> Andrew Divoff, a Russian-Venezuelan actor you probably know best for playing Mikhail Bakunin on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em> speaks English, Spanish, Italian, French, German, Catalan, Portuguese and Russian. And he knew how to speak Romanian, but forgot when he had nobody to speak to with it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherLee">Christopher Lee</a> spoke English, French, Italian, Spanish, and German; had proficiency in Swedish, Russian, and Greek; and if Sir <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IanMcKellen">Ian McKellen</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/lotr/010828.htm">is to be believed,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> could handle a little bit of Afrikaans, Zulu, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, and Swahili!
</li><li> While it's not known how fluent he was, actor Paul Robeson studied Swahili, Bantu, Igbo, Yoruba, Zulu, Chinese, Russian, and Hindi.
</li><li> Cardinal Giuseppe Caspar Mezzofanti (17741849) was fluent in 30 contemporary languages. Although some historians claim that his abilities could have been limited to the theological and religious matter, an ability to carry out a sermon or maintain a philosophical dispute in so many languages is definitely a mark of great fluency.
</li><li> Emil Krebs (18671930), German diplomat, is considered the greatest polyglot of all times. He was fluent in more than 60 languages not counting the regional dialects and dead languages and used 33 of them on a daily basis. He was so proficient in most of them that native speakers were often asking for help in linguistic matters, which is no small feat, given he spent a large part of his adult life in China. According to his contemporaries, he needed roughly 2-3 months to achieve relative fluency in a new language.
</li><li> Christopher Columbus spoke his native Italian (at least the contemporary Genoese variant—Ligurian), spoke Castilian Spanish as the servant of the Spanish kings, knew Portuguese and Arabic as a sailor experienced in sailing around the Mediterranean, kept the official records in Latin and an "unofficial" record in Greek. He was not especially exceptional, moreover, in his language skills among the contemporary sailors.
</li><li> Pope John Paul II could speak at least twelve languages and used at least nine as Pope.
</li><li> The now-retired Pope Benedict XVI, speaks nine languages.
</li><li> Actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradDourif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradDourif">Brad Dourif</a> speaks German, French, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic, and Japanese. He can also pull off a British accent so flawless that he has fooled actual British people that he was one of them. In fact, whenever he reverted to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernFriedGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SouthernFriedGenius">native West Virginia drawl</a> on the set of ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a>', people would tell him that his hillbilly impressions were hilarious.
</li><li> Diane Kruger, most notably of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalTreasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NationalTreasure">National Treasure</a></em> movies and Tarantino's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IngloriousBasterds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IngloriousBasterds">Inglorious Basterds</a></em> is fluent in German, French, and English. She even had to affect a German accent when speaking English in <em>Inglorious Basterds</em> because she almost completely lacks one.
</li><li> Uschi Digard, big-bust model and softcore movie star, taught herself to speak eight languages (German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, French, and English) as a child because she was a voracious reader and wanted to read every book in her town's library.
</li><li> Sri Lankan Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith is fluent in Sinhala, English, Tamil (these three being the official languages of his home country of Sri Lanka), German, French, Italian, Spanish, Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia, where he was Apostolic Nuncio from 2004-2005), Greek, Latin and Hebrew.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikolaTesla">Nikola Tesla</a> was able to speak at least 8 languages; his native Serbian/Serbo-Croatian/whatever they're calling it this week, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km9-DiFaxpU">Tim Doner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is the youngest person to achieve this title.
</li><li> German politician Willy Brandt, who was born in Lübeck spoke Low German (which gave him a reasonable understanding of Dutch) as a mother tongue, learned High German in school and later acquired reasonable fluency in English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish and Spanish. When he was Secretary of State from 1966 to 1969, he took French classes because he thought his linguistic abilities weren't enough for such a position. Most of his languages were acquired during his life in exile (Denmark, Norway, and Spain for a short time), but probably his most enduring act of communication involved no talking at all, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSitDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticSitDown">dramatic genuflection (i.e., kneeling)</a> in Warsaw.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Karl Marx</a> was quite able to write in several European languages and (as a matter of course for an educated gentleman of his era) had a knowledge of Latin and Greek by the end of high school. This shows in his work, which is hard to understand as it is without the allusions to obscure foreign language terms. His main languages, however, were German (his native tongue) and English (as he lived in England for much of his life, and died there).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note12g62s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note12g62s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note12g62s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">He also conducted a rather interesting correspondence with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>—all in perfect English.</span> He even elaborates on minutiae like the difference between the English words "worth" and "value" - in the <em>German</em> edition.
</li><li> Alfred Nobel knew five languages (Swedish, Russian, German, English, and French) by age seventeen. He once ran an ad in those languages looking for a personal assistant and got a response in all five languages from one applicant: Bertha von Suttner. He hired her on the spot. She was a well-known pacifist and may well have been responsible for the inventor of dynamite and dealer in weapons-grade explosive dedicating his fortune to the Nobel Peace Prize (along with that whole "Merchant of Death" obituary).
</li><li> The European Commission suggests that every European learn two living European languages in addition to their mother tongue. Given that primary and secondary education is the purview of the member states (and sometimes states <em>within</em> those member states), the actual results vary quite a bit with the Nordic countries and some Central and Eastern European nations running up the score whereas others like France and Spain, have trouble getting even one language down, with Ireland managing to have trouble getting its <em>own</em> language down.
</li><li> Member of the British Parliament and current Master World Trader for the City of London Robert Woodthorpe Browne speaks English, French, Spanish and German which makes sense as all those languages are under the Livery's purview.
</li><li> It is rather rare for most of the previous generations of Nigerians to speak only one language. Prior to the 1990s and beyond, the average Nigerian (post-Biafran war) was educated in English, French, and German in their British-based schools (Portuguese sometimes got thrown in) and they would learn their tribal tongue from their parents. Some Nigerians would learn one of the big three (four if you include Arabic) native tongues of the nation. So you could have a situation in which a middle- to upper-class Nigerian would speak English, French, German, Portuguese, Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, and Arabic because the state demanded it of them.
</li><li> Benny Lewis can speak English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Esperanto, Mandarin Chinese, Irish, Dutch, and American Sign Language. He runs a website called <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/">Fluent in 3 Months.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> A slight aversion: people from Balkans understand Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrian...because it's all basically the same language.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8iKZEra5I0">Ioannis Ikonomou<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an EU Translator who speaks 32 languages and was fluent in 15 languages by the time he was 20 years old. He speaks Greek, English, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Finnish, Danish, Russian, East African Swahili, Hebrew, Arabic, Mandarin, and Bengali, knowing 21 out of the 42 languages spoken in the EU.
</li><li> Besides being acclaimed in his home country as a national hero, Filipino nationalist and intellectual Jose Rizal (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoliMeTangere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NoliMeTangere">Noli Me Tangere</a></em> fame no less) was known for being able to speak <em>twenty-two</em> languages, including Spanish, French, Latin, Greek, German, Portuguese, Italian, English, Dutch, and Japanese. He also knew some Malay and could also speak Chavacano, Cebuano, Ilocano, and Subanon.
