</p><p>While certainly admirable, this may have a few negative side-effects on the hero and those around them. Such heroes could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SamaritanSyndrome">wear themselves out</a> in their attempts to help everyone or become distraught and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllMyFault">blame themselves</a> for the one time that they're unable to save the day. Spending so much time and effort saving everyone else can also put a strain on the hero's personal or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsNotYouItsMyEnemies">dating life</a>. A particularly bad case of this may develop into a full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause">Martyr Without a Cause</a>. Maybe they simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmsWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmsWay">like being in the line of danger</a>.
</p><p>If they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">aren't smart about their heroism</a>, and they have a tendency to intervene without getting the whole picture, then they're liable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">just make things worse</a>. Their predictable heroism also makes them particularly prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">manipulation by certain devious villains</a>. Interestingly enough, as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DonQuixote">Don Quixote</a></em> lampshades, this syndrome was noticed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChivalricRomance">Chivalric Romance</a> writers and they devised a temporary cure: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselErrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselErrant">Damsel Errant</a> must simply ask the hero not to engage in any other adventure until he has finished hers.

The characters are just too darn heroic to leave people to suffer, so time to go wander around in caves for a while. No matter their personal situation, they're always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudleyDoRightStopsToHelp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudleyDoRightStopsToHelp">willing to stop and help</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallStepsHero">Small Steps Heroes</a> tend to suffer from this.

Later on, it's revealed that this compulsion stems from an incident in his childhood where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he offered help to a boy who was sitting on the side of the street and cradling his head but was rebuffed.

Yami Yugi struggles with this throughout the series, as he doesn't want his friends hurt to the point that he's unwilling to let others help. Alexander exploits this by saying he doesn't <em>need</em> his friends. It's played straight throughout but is most notable in the last arc, Millennium World. At one point Atem fights Bakura and in order to stop Bakura sacrificing people, he uses his own spirit monster, Slifer/Osiris, to absorb the damage. He gets badly hurt and the priests arrive to back him up. However, when the priests are unable to beat Bakura, Atem goes to attempt to talk Bakura down rather than let them get hurt, even though he has no weapons and no reason to believe Bakura will stop.

However, this doesn't extend to just fooling around with girls. If a visitor is facing a dilemma that can't necessarily be remedied with hanging out at the club, Tamaki Suoh pretty much rallies everyone else to help the visitor in any way they can, as the motto of the Host Club is to <em>ensure</em> a visitor leaves satisfied with the service.
<ul><li> Most of this has to do with Tamaki Suoh himself, as he is always the one who steps up to the plate and pulls everyone along with him. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Results may vary if they want to go along with it, though.</a>

He always has "super hearing," but exactly <em>how</em> super tends to vary wildly; sometimes he can hear whispers from far across the city, and sometimes he can hear <em>everything</em>. Showing surprising depth, writers have included this into his character; if he can literally hear <em>everything</em>, then every panel of him doing something mundane means that we are seeing Superman make a deliberate decision to not help somebody since there is always <em>somebody</em> who needs help somewhere and he has to hear them crying or screaming. Mention is often made that had to learn to "tune out" what he has to since he has accepted that even he cannot be everywhere for everyone, and has to accept that some people need to be ignored.

<ul><li> Kara Zor-El is the same kind of hero as her cousin, but she is more short-tempered and more compassionate, which means that she feels <em>more</em> compelled to be a hero, punish criminals and help people.
</li><li> Back in the Silver Age she had to do her heroism in secret for her first few years until her existence was revealed to the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KryptonNoMore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/KryptonNoMore">Krypton No More</a></em> she wants to undertake an off-world mission because she and her cousin "fight injustice wherever it strikes".

Whenever he feels that something is not his problem, he remembers what his uncle Ben taught him: "With great power comes great responsibility". Of course, the first time he let a crook go because it "wasn't his problem", he ended up regretting it for the rest of his life.
<ul><li> This is often subverted, in that many times he'll bust his ass to get to the scene of a crime only to discover that one of New York's many many other superheroes already took care of it in the time it took him to get there.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MaryJaneWatson">Mary Jane Watson</a> showed a bit of this too, even against supervillains. She would try to disrupt, derail or delay their plans, if not as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Spanner in the Works</a> then at least as a fly in the ointment. She relied on her charm and wit to protect her until a superhero (usually Spidey) could take over. If those all failed her, she still never regretted trying.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UltimateSpiderMan">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>, in particular, feels the need to insert himself in any potentially hostile situation. While he generally does more good than harm, he also gets his butt kicked and makes a lot of things worse. Ultimate Team-Up shows what happens when he doesn't know what's going on <em>very</em> well. Unlike regular Peter, Ultimate Peter is unable to quit being Spidey for even a <em>day</em>... and it's eventually what gets him killed (though he did eventually get better).
</li><li> When he got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralSplitPersonality">Literal Split Personality</a> between "Power" and "Responsibility" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickSpencersSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NickSpencersSpiderMan">Nick Spencer's Spider-Man</a></em>, Powerless Peter became compelled to help anyone he could without powers, including trying to change someone's tyre with no idea what he was doing and being arrested for paying other people's parking meters.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheFlash">The Flash</a> also has this problem pretty badly. He is convinced that with his speed, it should be possible to be literally everywhere at once and fix every problem he encounters. When a fire breaks out and cripples a woman in Keystone City, Flash is so disturbed by this that he goes to fellow speeder Johnny Quick to obtain Johnny's source of speed upgrade. The results are pretty predictable, and lessons are learned by all. This is taken to its logical extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em>, as the Flash quite literally becomes the speed force and as a result is EVERYWHERE in Keystone City. As a result of this, he's forever turned Keystone City into a crime-free ghost town and has lost his sense of self entirely, becoming not one Flash, but a strange mix between Jay Garrick, Barry Allen, and Wally West.
<ul><li> Jay Garrick as well. One story in <em>Flash</em> #750 shows him at the outbreak of World War 2 getting disillusioned by what's going on, but noting that he and his girlfriend Joan talked about it, and she tells him he'd <em>never</em> be able to give up helping people, which Jay agrees with.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on the story, most of the cast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComics">Archie Comics</a> could count. Betty Cooper got this once. Her nice girl/girl next door personality kept her exhausted with volunteer work and kinda turned her into a doormat.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Empowered">Empowered</a>, despite the fact that nearly everyone treats her like a joke. Any time she finds out about a problem, she <em>will</em> get involved, without fail, even if she <em>knows</em> she's in over her head.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> shows this too. Sometimes he may be an overly pragmatic jerkass or just accept that lives will be lost, other times he will NOT give up on saving everyone and everything, even at the cost of his own life. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheCapedCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhateverHappenedToTheCapedCrusader">Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?</a></em>, two stories like this are told. In one, he passes a baby to Harvey Bullock and then is swept away by floodwaters and drowns, and in another he throws a bomb and himself into Gotham River to explode so no one else is hurt.
<ul><li> This is a big part of why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Bane">Bane</a>'s plan worked during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Knightfall">Knightfall</a></em>. Even though he was sick (which Bane knew) he felt compelled to not get one minute of rest until he'd rounded up every single criminal Bane had busted out. At one point his body gave out on him and he collapsed on a random rooftop, where he got the only rest he'd get for that entire arc. It also played a role in the follow up <em>Knightsend</em> when Batman's successor went crazy. Send Robin and Nightwing after him? Call in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica">Justice League</a>? No. Clearly the only option is to physically rehabilitate after using surgery to recover from months of partial paralysis and retrain his body and skills with the help of one of his deadliest enemies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyShiva" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LadyShiva">Lady Shiva</a>, so that he could take down the new Batman himself.
</li><li> Zig-Zagged by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamSeries">Batman: Arkham Series</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing">Nightwing</a> has this pretty bad, to the point where he's a lawful policeman by day and a vigilante by night. This obsession eventually costs him his relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Oracle">Barbara Gordon</a>. Then Blockbuster uses this against him, taunting him by saying he can kill everyone that Nightwing is close to. Even when his own life is threatened, Nightwing is concerned more with protecting the baddie than anything else.
</li><li> In <em>X-Men Noir</em>, Thomas "The Angel" Halloway's entire life revolves around heroism—to the point that Professor Xavier diagnoses him with a completely new type of pathology, "heropathy". This is illustrated in their first encounter; Xavier asks Halloway why he cares about the X-Men. Halloway tells him that a woman, Jean Grey, is dead, the police aren't investigating her murder because she was with the X-Men... and he can't live in a world where a killer isn't brought to justice.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Patoruzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Patoruzu">Patoruzú</a> and Patoruzito are the most blatant Argentinian examples of this trope. The tagline of his comic book goes: "Courageous to the point of fearlessness. Altruist to the point of sacrifice. Brave to the point of heroism. But modest to the point of sainthood, and hilarious to the point of comedy."
</li><li> Karolina Dean of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways">Runaways</a> has a bad case of this, possibly as a result of her bipolar disorder.

In the 2017 series, she actually does get therapy for these tendencies and actually manages to have a stable life and relationship... only to throw it all away because Gert blunders into danger and needs rescuing. She falls off the wagon so hard that she ends up trying to become an actual superhero and nearly dies when an actual supervillain drains her of her powers.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nova">Nova</a></em>: Richard Rider has a particularly bad case of this, brought on by fighting in the Annihilation War (and an absence of therapists to help with the survivor's guilt and shell-shock that came with it). The first issue of vol. 4 has him rushing to answer <em>every</em> high-priority distress call in his back-log without stopping for things like food or rest... and nearly flying straight into a black hole as a result. By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy2020" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy2020">Guardians of the Galaxy (2020)</a></em>, which deconstructs it, between several more apocalyptic disasters (and some slightly not-so-apocalyptic ones, like his brother turning evil and insane), Rich's CHS has gotten so bad he's having problems functioning, and Gamora bluntly tells him it's why their relationship failed, and has to go into therapy.

<ul><li> Shinji and Asuka were at their lowest when Daniel showed up and offered to help them and give back everything that was taken from them. At the beginning they were hesitant but he proved that his offer was genuine and well-meaning, and they learnt that he and his family are fully committed to helping as many people as possible, even visiting other timelines and dimensions... and it actually saddens him that he can not help everyone in everywhere. Later Asuka asks him why he does it and he answers: "How might I do otherwise? Seeing people in need and choosing not helping them is actively holding back from making the right right. I could never do that."
</li><li> Maybe it is because he blames himself for their situation -since he was the one chose blowing everyone up-, but Shinji went out of his way to help strangers whose relatives had been dragged away by the secret police, even though he had nothing to win and much to lose if he was caught giving them food.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> has a lot of the Avengers with this, but the crowning example is Harry - by the sequel he knows perfectly well the kind of hell that he'll probably go through in trying to save the day, picking up the gauntlet and take down the ravening monster. He's also entirely aware that often (not always, but when he brings up the subject in a bitter rant, he'd recently been through a horrific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeingGoodSucks">Being Good Sucks</a>.

</li><li> This is picked apart in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LiveAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LiveAHero">Live a Hero</a></em> in regards to All Might's attempts to help a mentally stunted and traumatized Izuku. Since All Might always saves people no matter what, he's practically conditioned to being able to solve someone's problems just by showing up, taking out the bad guys, and saving people. As Eraserhead points out, Izuku is an entirely different case, as what the League of Villains made him go through traumatized him to the point where it would take a lifetime of therapy and help just to reach some semblance of normality.

Captain America has a variation in that, after being forced to depend upon herself so often over a long period of time, she's very unwilling to stand aside and let others fight battles on her behalf, or simply trust that they can handle a given problem without assistance. This is especially true when she feels someone is making a serious mistake or handling a situation in a way she feels is wrong. Much of the drama of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RiseOfTheExtraordinaryAvengersCoreline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RiseOfTheExtraordinaryAvengersCoreline">Rise Of The Extraordinary Avengers Coreline</a></em> comes from the fact that her reacting to what she thinks is a deeply flawed plan by fellow superhero group "The Champions" instead comes off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">her lording it over them</a>, driving many of the Champions to develop bad blood for her and her fellow Avengers by proxy... one of the links of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChainsOfCommanding">The Chains of Commanding</a> that Mari needs to deal with during the story.

In fact, this trait is what made Solas notices and falls in love with her in the first place.

The encounter ends with Izuku's arrest, subsequent trial and conviction. Not only does the trial keep him from taking the U.A.

His new criminal status makes him even more of a social pariah than when he was just Quirkless. He's even forced to move to Tokyo for a year in order to serve out his probation. This all happened because Izuku hadn't thought of the potential consequences when he ran in to save someone he doesn't even know. All of these things get pointed out to him by his new guardian, who told him that he should have just contacted a professional like a police officer or an actual Hero.
<ul><li> This gets so bad that he intentionally tries to clamp down on his own heroic instincts and tried his best not to get involved, but he still can't help himself when he sees Ann in clear distress.

Izuku is aware of this and <em>knows</em> that he should be focusing on passing the exam, but he still can't help himself and ends up with a paltry 15 Villain Points by the end even though he could have wracked up hundreds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerLottery">with his powers</a>.

When they have to investigate a temple, Shirou suggests Waver Velvet stay behind because if they die, the women Shirou saved will have no one to protect them. Earlier, Shirou forgave a former enemy who nearly killed both himself and his lover after said enemy begged him to save her lover.

Maybe I just wasn't the hardened mercenary I was supposed to be at this point. But the fact was that leaving when the threat had been the Simurgh had been one thing. Everyone knew it was almost impossible to do much actual damage to the Endbringers. Nothing we had would put a dent in her. I'd understood leaving at that point. But now? Now there were monsters running around the city, monsters that, as far as I knew, we could hurt. I couldn't make myself walk away from that. Not now. <br/>Leet just shook his head in disgust at me.

<ul><li> Elspeth often had to be forcibly conscripted, otherwise she wouldn't do it out of fear. A better example is Gideon Jura, who has been suffering from this since he was a young troublemaker. Between the RTR block and the BFZ block, he spent all his time planeswalking between Zendikar and Ravnica, trying his hardest to save everyone: from small villages under Eldrazi attack to random citizens of Ravnica being bombed by a pair of goblins. At one time he spends three days awake and fighting without rest until his body collapsed at the last minute.

</li><li> Virtually every MMO steers the player's character into having Chronic Hero Syndrome.

As he needs help from the Assassins in the city, he winds up working to bolster them in their fight against the Templars. He also befriends Suleiman, the future Sultan, whose father and uncle are involved in a war for the succession of the Sultanate. Further, he meets and falls in love with a librarian in his search for the keys and is eventually forced to protect her from his enemies.

</li><li> There's a whole class of games where you have to work your way through obstacles in a prescribed order to beat the level (get food to chop tree, chop tree to fix bridge, fix bridge to talk to next NPC, etc.). <em>Ballad of Solar</em> is one version that adds "a villain has kidnapped the princess!" as the driving force of the plot. At first it seems like Hitchcockian suspense: The hero moseys along despite the player knowing something horrible is happening. But then the hero spots the capital burning, and finds the king in mourning for his captive daughter, and vows to go rescue her immediately. Of course, not without (in just the first few levels) putting out fires and rebuilding the peasants' homes and workplaces, picking apples to feed starving children, gathering hay and buckets of water to coax lost horses into returning to their master, defeating a small collection of minor monsters, sweeping cobwebs... (And that's not even counting the times when an NPC goes "Well, I <em>would</em> move out of your way so you could get the thing behind me, but dang it, I just don't have the energy to do so without a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotCoupon">Plot Coupon</a>." That's literally their excuse. "I'm too tired to move without my wine." "I'm too tired to move without my energy potion." It's not even disguised.)

In his case, it's less that he feels responsible for everything and more along the lines of the whole scenario where someone is forced to do underpaid work in the hope of building enough of a rep to start a proper business - he is rude to everyone asking him to help them and complains about the menial quality of the work almost the whole time.

Most people with Chronic Hero Syndrome end up helping the people around them because they can't help themselves, despite all the damage and disruption it causes their normal lives. Adol, by contrast, was told that there were still people in the world that were being eaten by dragons and enslaved by sorcerers at an impressionable age and decided then and there that somebody needed to do something about that.

</li><li> John Egbert of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck">Homestuck</a></em> is totally unable to conceive of not throwing himself between other people and danger, no matter what the risk to himself is. Tellingly, upon gaining guaranteed immortality unless he dies in a just or heroic fashion, he immediately begins hatching heroic plans that relied upon abusing the immortality he would forfeit <em>by carrying out heroic plans</em>.
<ul><li> Aimless Renegade is shown to be similar with his obsession with law and justice. His very first reaction upon seeing John <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">unconscious on a falling meteor</a> is to immediately pull what he thought would be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> and he goes into fits over people breaking any crime or potentially harming something else. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It gets him killed at the end of Act 5 when he hesitates to blow up a teleporter out of fear of harming Wayward Vagabond, thus giving Bec Noir the opportunity and reason to decapitate him.</span>

</li><li> The title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ArthurKingOfTimeAndSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ArthurKingOfTimeAndSpace">Arthur, King of Time and Space</a></em>, whether he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestCorporateExecutive">crusading CEO</a>, a lone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSheriff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSheriff">sheriff</a>, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething">king who refuses to ignore a cry for help or send his knights to do something he could do himself</a>.

</li><li> Edith of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Godslave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Godslave">Godslave</a></em> jumps to Anpu's aid the moment she sees him in trouble, even though at this point she doesn't know who Anpu is and why it's so important for him to escape the Blacksmith. She doesn't hesitate to defend him even after she finds out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">just who</a> the Blacksmith is.
</li><li> Gracenote, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StarMares" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StarMares">Star Mares</a></em>, often finds her general desire to help other ponies at odds with her limited ability to do so. Her hero complex not only provokes her to try to save ponies she just met, it even drives her to try to save her nominal enemies.
</li><li> James Sirius of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HarryPotterComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/HarryPotterComics">Harry Potter Comics</a></em> inherited his father's heroic tendencies. Thought with James, it's equal parts a desire to help people and a desire to have adventures like his dad (as such he ends up in over his head far more often than Harry did).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheGodOfHighSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheGodOfHighSchool">The God of High School</a></em>'s Jin Mo-Ri has a tendency to go after small-time crooks and break the rules to save people even when it inconveniences him. This habit is what gets him into most of his problems such as nearly being disqualified from the competition and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">getting himself trapped in the Sage Realm</span>.
</li><li> Bam in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TowerOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TowerOfGod">Tower of God</a></em> has a bit of an issue with this, and at some point, he has to stop and consider whether it's actually a form of selfishness on his part. The clearest example of trying to save everyone and right all wrongs is on the Hell Train when he's made to play a deadly game where he and his opponents both have to save their teammates from being lowered into their nasty deaths. You get points for saving teammates, but you have to spend points to go in to save them, and your opponent can try to stop you. The one who ends up with most points wins. After his opponent, Hoaqin, makes it clear he's perfectly fine with playing with the lives of others and he's not going to try to save all his teammates, Bam decides he's going to save <em>everyone</em> — even Hoaqin's evil teammates whose rescue gives points to Hoaqin instead, and even though Bam doesn't have enough points to do it and Hoaqin is more powerful and has the upper hand as it is. Yeah, Bam could probably use help from a plot twist right about now...
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a> in "Deng Deng". Bam's group goes looking for Deng Deng in order to hand him over to Baylord Yama in exchange for military aid. However, when Deng Deng says he doesn't want to go back because he'll be forced to serve Yama, Bam promises to give him his freedom. He then talks about fighting Yama for Deng Deng's freedom, even though Yama is still way out of his league. However, it turns out Bam isn't <em>just</em> doing it to be nice to Deng Deng. He also reasons that doing a single favour to Yama isn't going to be enough to trust that he'll really give his aid unless they also show him some strength instead of just cowering in front of him. Besides, he isn't really planning to literally fight Yama but to challenge him in a game.
