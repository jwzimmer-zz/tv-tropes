Clearing the streets turns into a firefight when a soldier mistakes a wrench in a man's hand for a gun (thanks to a bit of a prod from Gouda). But as the entire convoy was just a decoy, the entire thing was probably set up by Gouda <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChessMaster">with exactly such an outcome in mind</a>.

</li><li> A character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> becomes paranoid that his bodyguard is going to kill him and shoots him when the guard reaches in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.

</li><li> The "War Games" arc of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> comic continuity started when, at a meeting between Gotham mob bosses, one reached inside his jacket for a lighter.

When questioned by Jim Gordon, Flass pulls out the youth's comb and claims he mistook it for a switchblade.
</li><li> The last issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Transmetropolitan">Transmetropolitan</a></em> has the National Guard attempting to lock down one of The City's universities; the unarmed students rush the troops, slapping smiley-face stickers on their uniforms in protest. One of the guardsmen, seeing a demonstrator reaching into his jacket (to print more stickers on a portable maker, by the way), opens fire.

Cloak, because of his stutter, couldn't stop them before they fired, and the guilt from this incident prompted him to run away from home.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnInnocentMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnInnocentMan">An Innocent Man</a></em>, this sparks the events of the plot when two police officers shoot a man, mistaking his hair dryer for a weapon. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound">He lives</a>, and fights for his innocence after being framed by said police officers.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CopLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CopLand">Cop Land</a></em> opens with a police shooting of a pair of black teenagers on the road, whose shooter thought they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopTheTires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PopTheTires">popped one of his tires</a> with a gun. In fact, the "gunman" was taunting him with a steering wheel lock, and the tire popped because of a leftover shard of glass from a beer bottle he crushed driving out of a parking lot earlier that night. In an early sign that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCops">Dirty Cops</a> are involved, one of his colleagues tries to plant evidence of a firearm to exonerate him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em>: Al Powell shot a kid who brandished a toy gun, which Powell mistook for a real one. The guilt from this incident led him to be unable to draw his gun on anyone else, so he was relegated to desk work. Near the end, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> Karl makes a last stand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestSecondChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestSecondChance">Al is ultimately the one to shoot him down so he could save John's life</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FallingDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FallingDown">Falling Down</a></em> has a classic example, where D-Fens pulls a water gun on Martin Prendergast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">intentionally getting himself killed</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GranTorino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GranTorino">Gran Torino</a></em>, Walt pulls out a lighter acting as if it were a gun, intentionally scaring the gang to shoot him dead <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">so that he can get them arrested for murder in revenge for what they did to his friend Sue</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bean">Bean</a></em>, Mr. Bean sees some security guards at the airport, and thinks their guns are so cool he reaches into his jacket and pretends to have one himself. The guards see him and think he's actually got a gun. Hilarity ensues.
</li><li> In the Tim Allen/Kirstie Alley comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForRicherOrPoorer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForRicherOrPoorer">For Richer or Poorer</a></em>, Allen's character pulls out a phone when he steps out of a car to be met by cops. One cop shoots the phone, believing it to be a gun.
</li><li> Another example of an Eastwood film. <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/APerfectWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/APerfectWorld">A Perfect World</a></em> ends with Butch being shot by a sniper when he was reaching in his pocket to give Phillip something. Eastwood's character punches him out for making the mistake, even though other characters point out that anyone could have made the mistake (it was mostly out of frustration).
</li><li> Spoofed in the Matthew Perry/Liz Hurley film, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ServingSara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ServingSara">Serving Sara</a></em>.

Hank does so. Earl is pissed off, claiming that had he pulled out his wallet, they'd have shot him. On the other hand, Hank is an ex-cop, so it's possible the arresting officers recognized him.

At one point when the pornographer reaches under his coat, Paulie draws his gun shouting "Don't move!" only for it to be a cigar case. At the end of the episode, they've no evidence against the pornographer, even though he indirectly caused the death of their friend's daughter. The pornographer is smirking at this, and reaches for a cigar to celebrate whereupon Paulie shouts "Don't move!" then immediately shoots him. Although the only other witness (a police officer who entered the room at that moment) backs up his statement that the criminal appeared to be reaching for a gun, Scali knows the truth and insists that Paulie leave his department.

<ul><li> Another episode had Bulldog accidentally foil a robbery this way.

</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>, Lennie Briscoe and Ed Green were searching a house when the suspect came back home. Lennie called the police, the suspect reached into his pocket before Ed Green tackled him. Turns out the guy was only reaching for his cell phone. Another episode had this <em>invoked by the criminal</em>, as he threw down an object onto the ground. It took a second for the police chasing him to notice it was NOT an explosive, but just a lighter. However, that second was all the guy needed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">reach the Russian Embassy</a>.

Logan is distraught at his mistake, and though he is cleared of wrongdoing, he seeks counseling to deal with his guilt.
<ul><li> In another episode, police responding to an apparent hostage situation shoot a man who turns out to have been holding a toy. It's discovered that the alleged hostage intentionally engineered the situation to get the man killed.
</li><li> In a bit of a reversal, one episode reveals that this is how Eames' husband, an undercover detective, was killed. After making a drug buy, he reached for his badge to tell the dealers they'd been busted, but one of them, a trigger-happy teenager, mistook his action as reaching for a gun and shot him. He was horrified by his actions and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">became a doctor</a> in hopes of somehow making up for what he'd done.

The investigation reveals that the officer in question fired recklessly and was hit by her own ricochet. Amaro is still cleared because it's ruled that it was reasonable for him to think there was a threat, even though he turned out to be wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue">NYPD Blue</a></em>:
<ul><li> Andy Sipowicz relates a story to his son, Andy Jr., when the former is trying to teach the latter lessons on how to become a good cop. Andy Sr. was pounding a beat at midnight, when he saw two well-dressed guys in an alley standing next to a Cadillac; one of them had what looked like a real machine gun in his hands. He came very close to shooting them both, believing them to be wiseguys. He later learned that the building they were standing next to was a toy factory which made toy machine-guns; one of the well-dressed guys was an executive of the company who was taking one of the toys home for his kid at the end of his work shift. Andy Sr. tells Andy Jr. this story to drive home the point that to be a good cop, you should know the people and places on your beat, the things they do, and the times they do them.
</li><li> In another episode, while Martinez &amp; Medavoy are in their car, Martinez shoots a man in a car next to them who was pulling out a gun. However, in the ensuing commotion, the gun disappears and Martinez is suspected of doing this. By the end of the episode, the gun is found, clearing Martinez of any wrongdoing.
</li><li> Another episode has the detectives dealing with the fallout from the Amadou Diallo case (see below). They're frustrated by the fact that that incident tainted the entire department, and they get blamed for it when they had nothing to do with it.
</li></ul></li><li> An especially heartbreaking example occurs in season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues">Hill Street Blues</a></em> when an officer responding to a prowler call enters a seemingly empty apartment and sees a gun being pointed at him.

The bum almost drops his wine bottle and lunges to save it. Reed thought he was going for a gun and nearly shot him before Malloy (who was at a different angle and could see the bottle) intervened. Malloy proceeds to tell Reed that "anybody could have made that mistake", and chewed the bum out for his stupidity.

Not only was he a Neo-Nazi, but he was also assaulting a black woman, screamed "You wanna die, hero?!" as Deeks and Blye were running towards him shouting "LAPD!", and was, according to Blye, a multiple murderer wanted by the FBI.
<ul><li> And then subverted and played: a) the guy was an undercover cop and not actually a Neo-Nazi, b) Deeks was shooting blanks and therefore he's not dead and c) Deeks was in on the whole plan. Kensi was the one who needed to believe in it.

The perp turned a corner and ran past another guy who happened to be wearing the exact same clothes. The other guy reached into his jacket to assure that the engagement ring he just bought was safe and turned around. The cop then turned the corner, mistook the innocent guy for the perp (he didn't get a good look at the perp prior to this), saw him reaching into his jacket, and shot him. Complicating things further, both the perp and the bystander were black while the cop was white, leading to a riot. The cop is <em>crushed</em> when he learns the whole truth, and tells Mac he wishes he could go back in time and take the bullet instead.
</li><li> In the Danish crime series, <em>The Eagle</em>, a CIA agent convinces one of the detectives that a Muslim man with a mobile phone is about to activate a remote-controlled bomb.

</li><li> In a season 6 episode, a police officer named Thomas Scully is up for promotion to Sergeant. However, Frank knows this could pose trouble, because 14 years earlier, Scully and three other cops were responsible for shooting an unarmed Muslim teenager 61 times in a dark apartment. All four officers were acquitted of all charges, but three of the four (Scully being the exception) resigned in disgrace after the trial. Later in the episode, it's mentioned by Jamie that Scully did a course on the shooting in question, explaining that their precinct had been on edge due it being after 9/11 and shortly after a cop had been shot in a housing project. The victim had been reaching for his wallet when they shot him.
</li><li> Another episode has a (white) uniformed cop shoot a black teenager in a predominantly black neighborhood. The cop claims the kid had a gun, except all the witnesses deny this, and no gun is found. It's not until the end that Frank personally visits the owner of the shop right next to the shooting site and <em>suggests</em> that she hand over the gun that she pocketed in the confusion with no repercussions to her. He even chooses his words to make it seem as if she only took the gun to keep any kid from grabbing it to make her more likely to hand it over.

A police officer (played by Keagan) whips out his gun and repeatedly shoots at nearly every black person that he sees under the delusion that they have a gun, including a black man with a popsicle, a black man with his white friend eating bananas ("Watch out! That black guys got a gun and he's gonna steal your banana!"), a black man carrying a massive stuffed giraffe ("Big fuzzy gun!") and the chief of police with a cup of coffee. At the same time, he hilariously overlooks a white guy carrying multiple assault rifles and a gun belt.

One night, he sees someone trying to break into Cleveland's house, and when the figure reaches inside his pocket, Peter shoots him, only to discover that it was Cleveland Jr, who hadn't heard Peter ask him to step away from the window due to having his iPod on, which was what he was reaching for. The entire affair turns into a hate crime debate (in reality, Peter could only see a dark shape and had no idea who it was, much less his skin color). Peter avoids jail only by a lawyer hired by Carter Pewterschmidt instead painting Cleveland as a dangerous thug, which Peter immediately regrets and admits to shooting Cleveland Jr because he was scared, not out of racism, accepting jail time. Cleveland, realizing Peter really didn't do it out of racism, confesses to the shooting, making it a black-on-black crime, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">which makes the media instantly lose interest and leave</a>.

<ul><li> The Trope name is based on <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Amadou_Diallo">the Amadou Diallo shooting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, in which four New York City police officers fired a total of 41 rounds at a pedestrian whom they thought was pulling out a gun that turned out to be his wallet on February 4th, 1999. It was for a time the poster-child incident of the ongoing debate over police conduct and brutality in the United States. Also, considering that the victim was a Guinean (read: black) immigrant, there was also suspicion of racism.
<ul><li> Worth noting that the 41 rounds was harped on in the media as proof of excess, when it's actually police procedure to fire at a target until it goes down, however many shots it takes, and according to reports, Diallo had his back to a wall, meaning he stayed standing longer than he otherwise would have; the guilty officers interpreted this as him wearing a bulletproof vest. It also didn't help that one of the officers tripped on the curb a second or two after they opened fire, leading the rest of the officers to believe he'd been shot by Diallo, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">whose hands hadn't even moved since</a>.
</li><li> Panicked, repetitive motion is common in combat situations where a terrified combatant has not been properly trained; this is another factor in why some shooters empty a mag without meaning to. It's the same instinct that makes some people flail wildly at the spot where a bug crawled on their body even after the first stroke knocked it away or killed it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: Police or military forces under high alert, usually because of a heightened threat of terrorism, may be instructed to fire upon any suspicious or sudden movement by a person they're suspecting of carrying explosives. Because these explosives might be hidden, usually under the suspect's jacket, the police will aim for the head, both to avoid hitting the explosives and to ensure that the victim is incapacitated before reaching the detonating device. This is why you should always tell the cops what you're doing and move slowly if you're held up.
<ul><li> Sometimes this can be attributed to bad training. If you train an officer in a simulator to always fire at someone making a drawing motion (since it's always a gun in the simulation), then they will "sink to the level of their training" when someone pulls an object on them and conditioned combat reflexes kick in. Some modern simulators now include subjects that draw non-gun objects to train officers to quickly differentiate on the fly to avoid this sort of problematic conditioned response.
</li></ul></li><li> At least two police dash-cam recordings have aired on TruTV's <em>The Smoking Gun Presents</em> of drivers being pulled over and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">pointing cell phones at police officers in a menacing fashion</a>. Fortunately for the drivers in question, police held fire while identifying the object being pointed at them. Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotTryThisAtHome">Do Not Try This at Home</a>. As commenter Ron Kuby put it in one such instance, "Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, that will get you <em>dead</em>." Sadly, half the time, they're attempting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop">Suicide by Cop</a>.
</li><li> On a television documentary about the Secret Service, one agent who had been on Reagan's detail related the story about how a kid in a small town, on a dare, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">pointed a toy gun at the motorcade</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">had therefore been within heartbeats of being perforated by numerous weapons</a>, only stopped because the agent had identified the gun as a toy just before he would have drawn his weapon.
</li><li> The main reason why toy firearms are always brightly colored or have a bright orange cap on the barrel is specifically to differentiate them from actual weapons. This is the same reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Transformers">Megatron</a> is usually a tank nowadays (one of his original forms was a Walther P38 pistol). Of course, this won't protect you if you try something really dumb: Military and police personnel realize it takes no effort to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.examiner.com/gun-rights-in-tucson/orange-tipped-toy-guns-a-good-idea-gone-bad">paint a real gun's muzzle orange<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and they're not big fans of practical jokes in general.
<ul><li> One notable example of this that has received much media attention was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice">the 2014 death of Tamir Rice<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was shot dead by police in a park in Cleveland, Ohio, while playing with what was later found to be an air gun that had been specifically altered to look like a real gun. Though according to the released footage, the toy was tucked into Rice's waistband meaning the tip wasn't visible. However the gun wasn't drawn, let alone pointed at the officers, and the footage shows that officers didn't even exit their vehicle but just shot him on the spot. Compounding this was the fact that Tamir was 12 years old, Ohio is an open carry state<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10mqe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10mqe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10mqe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For non-US tropers, this means that anyone in Ohio (unless banned from having guns at all due to felony conviction) can legally carry a gun in public, so long as it isn't concealed. A permit is required to carry a concealed firearm. The majority of US states have such laws.</span>, and the Officer who shot him had previously been fired from another police department for emotional instability.
</li></ul></li><li> WikiLeaks claimed this happened with the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_12,_2007_Baghdad_airstrike">Apache airstrike in Baghdad in 2007<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in an incident that killed two reporters. Averted in reality; the reporters were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">embedded with a group of armed insurgents during a pitched battle in the city,</a> and one of them appeared to be acting as a spotter for the insurgents.
</li><li> A British police officer in Lancashire responding to a report of a man carrying a "samurai sword" ended up Tasering <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-19979184">a blind man carrying a white stick<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Must have seen too much <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zatoichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zatoichi">Zatoichi</a></em>.
</li><li> In a rather astounding example of incompetence, the LAPD in early 2013 was in the middle of a manhunt for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> Christopher Dorner when they stopped a blue Toyota truck and, suspecting it to be Dorner, immediately opened fire, injuring the driver, 47-year-old Margie Costanza, and critically wounding her 71-year-old mother, who was in the passenger seat. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gmsa');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gmsa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gmsa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Dorner had previously been identified driving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck">Grey Nissan truck</a>.</span> To compound on this mistake, less than an hour later, another police cruiser which was heading towards the shooting spotted a black Honda truck and proceeded to ram and open fire on the driver. None of the officers were charged with any crime.
</li><li> In 2014, a police officer shot a 17-year-old boy in the chest immediately after he answered the door. She claims he had pointed a handgun at her, but eyewitness accounts state that it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoWii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoWii">Wii Remote</a>.
</li><li> An unfortunate rash of incidents involving cops and dogs have happened around the United States over the years. Numerous police have been shooting family dogs and trying to give the justification that they either felt threatened or that the dog was running at them. Whether or not the dog actually was doesn't seem to matter to the police themselves, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">many officers are simply let off the hook</a> with only around a month's suspension without pay at the worst instead of losing their badge entirely, something that many people get up in arms about.
<ul><li> In general, there may be a reason for the officers to make such statements: they may not know the dog, so when the dog runs up to them, it can be difficult to determine if the dog is coming up to say hello or has been set loose by the owner to attack the officers. This has been especially so with pit bulls, a breed many assume is being used as an attack dog. Though it also happens regularly even to tiny dogs like chihuahuas and pugs (which would clearly be harmless to an adult human).
</li></ul></li><li> Controversy still persists over the shooting deaths of three IRA members in Gibraltar by British special forces. The official justification is that it was feared one or all had access to bomb detonator controls which were small enough to be carried in a pocket or otherwise hand-held, and that they hadn't indicated surrender or displayed empty hands to the SAS team seeking to detain them. Informed opinion is that this was a demonstration of an intent not to Irish terrorists, but to a Spanish government that was making sabre-rattling noises over Gib's sovereignty. Not long after the Falklands War, this was a coded way of telling the Spanish that any military incursion would be met with resolution - taking three terrorists out of circulation was secondary.
</li><li> On June 8th, 2011, Ernest Duenez, Jr. was shot to death in Manteca, California by police officers who were told Duenez had a knife. The police dashcam video shows the officers approaching him with guns drawn as he exited his truck, threatening to open fire if he moved. He was then seen reaching into the truck, and he was immediately shot by the police; he died of his injuries shortly afterward. Duenez actually <em>did</em> have a knife on him, however it was found in the bed of his truck - and therefore, away from anywhere Duenez could access it in a timely manner if he'd wanted to cause the officers harm, and the reason why he reached into the truck in the first place was to free his foot which had gotten trapped in the seatbelt when he attempted to exit the truck.
</li><li> In September, 2017, a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41351249">deaf man was shot to death by police<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>; the officers failed to hear the man's neighbours shouting that he couldn't hear them, and the victim, of course, couldn't hear the officer's commands to drop what he was holding (a metal pipe, rather than a gun). This case highlights the fact that traditional means of avoiding this sort of fate aren't accessible by everyone, especially as <a class="urllink" href="https://www.vox.com/2016/10/4/13161396/disability-police-officer-shooting">a shocking 25% of people shot by American police are disabled or mentally ill.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The (thankfully non-fatal) 2016 shooting <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Charles_Kinsey">of Charles Kinsey<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Florida social worker, happened because of this. Police were initially called because a 23-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Autism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Autism">autistic</a> man was wandering the neighborhood carrying a toy truck, which people mistook for a gun. Kinsey, who'd been in the process of getting the man back to the group home, laid down on his back with his arms raised and talking to officers as the patient sat nearby. Kinsey was shot by SWAT officer Jonathan Aledda, who later claimed that he was aiming at the patient because he thought he saw him make an aggressive movement towards Kinsey. Aledda was charged with attempted manslaughter and criminal negligence on April 12, 2017.
<ul><li> Compounding matters is that Aledda shot from behind police lines, endangering his fellow officers (who were closer to the scene and did <em>not</em> fire) on top of shooting Kinsey. And worse still is that, after being shot, both Kinsey and the patient were handcuffed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHelpingYourCase">and Kinsey was left untreated for 20 minutes after being shot in the leg</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In his nonfiction book <em>Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets</em> (which became the basis for the early seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HomicideLifeOnTheStreet">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></em>), David Simon describes the 1980 case of a Baltimore police officer who believed that a couple of teens were about to rob a sandwich shop. When one of them pulled something silver from his pocket, the cop shot him three times in the back without warning, leaving him paralyzed. The item turned out to be a cigarette lighter. No criminal charges were filed against the cop, but the department fired him even though he claimed he had feared for the safety of himself and others.
</li><li> In the infamous deadly Toronto van ram attack, Constable Ken Lam managed to corner the criminal and he repeatedly tried to lure the cop into shooting him. Constable Lam didn't fall for it and arrested him cleanly. Later, Lam shrugged off the praise for his restraint as just doing his duty.
</li><li> When halting a vehicle, Canadian and US soldiers have a series of increasingly awkward instructions designed to prevent this, such as keeping your hands crossed on the steering wheel, turning off the engine with your left hand, opening the car door with your right hand, etc. The idea is that you are consistently in such an awkward position that you'd never be able to pull anything out in time to be a threat, and if you refuse to follow these instructions or do something they don't tell you to do they now have a valid reason to suspect you as being hostile and have ample time to judge the situation.
