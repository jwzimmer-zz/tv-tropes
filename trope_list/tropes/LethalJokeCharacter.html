Weak attack, laughable specials, etc. And yet, your buddy next door uses them every time... and always kicks your ass.
</p><p>Are they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">Cherry Tapping</a>? Nope; the last time you won was when you put it on "random." TheyÂ’ve discovered how to use the Lethal Joke Character.
</p><p>The designers, looking for balance, have sneaked in one obscure, impossible-to-master, but incredibly rewarding technique for this character, and using it, you'll win every time... if you can get it down. But doing so requires skill, practice, and the ability to see the potential in the seemingly-useless. It's a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a> applied to the game mechanics.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyBard">Quirky Bard</a> is a subtrope found in many role-playing games. Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteTweak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteTweak">Elite Tweak</a>, an in-game feature which takes a capable character and turns them into a wrecking monster. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> refers to characters whose potential is more obvious, but requires more effort to utilize. Unlike a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a>, the Lethal Joke Character always had this ability to kick ass; it just requires a lot of skill to use them. See <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">Joke Item</a> for useless inventory and skills that eventually become overpowered. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">Heart Is an Awesome Power</a> is the non-gameplay version.

<ul><li> The mecha combat action game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCenturysEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnotherCenturysEpisode">Another Century's Episode 3</a></em> allows the player to unlock the Gotchko, a small, relatively basic unit from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OvermanKingGainer">Overman King Gainer</a></em>. It would seems like a bit of a joke character, or maybe just an affectionate inclusion to play to the fans of King Gainer... until you actually use it. The unit, with few or no upgrades, is one of the most powerful units in the game simply because of the ridiculous range and accuracy it has for its two weapons. It is restricted to ground stages, and cannot actually fly, but it doesn't need to. Seeing that Gotchko is Gain's unit of choice, this shouldn't be very surprising.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a></em>. She cannot reach all vantage points, she is constantly talking, she cannot take an enemy out without being heard. Yet, if she takes down 4 enemies in any way, she can go absolutely berserk, and can perform up to 4 instant takedowns. While Joker at least carried a gun, her gadgets consist of Snares made of confetti, Exploding Jack-in-a-boxes and laughing gas.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em>:
<ul><li> The base game has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNameIsQuestionMarks">??? (aka Blue Baby)</a>, who cannot ever pick up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Heart Containers</a> and thus has to subsist entirely on Soul Hearts, and whose starting item <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToiletHumor">allows him to poop on the floor once per room</a>. However, the inability to carry red hearts has some interesting effects on certain items that require the player to be half a red heart to use (such as Whore of Babylon always being active, and the Polaroid shielding the player after every hit, and the Scapular making him effectively invincible if used with the Cursed Skull) that can make Blue Baby a potential powerhouse.
</li><li> <em>Rebirth</em> added an even bigger <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Lost</span>, who's a true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a>, in exchange for starting out with flight and free Devil Room items. He's even trickier to use, but the Devil Room item pool contains powerful items like Whore of Babylon (which again, is permanently activated) Brimstone and the Dead Cat (which gives you 9 extra lives without the health penalties, since you have no health to begin with,) and there are items that can shield you once per room without having to take damage. <em>Afterbirth</em> made him even more lethal with the ability to unlock one of the shield items after giving enough money to the machine at the end of Greed Mode.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a>: Encounters In Space</em> has traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Characters</a> in the Ball and Core Fighters, but a number of other suits can be dangerous. Perhaps the best example would be the Japanese-only MS-06SHAKU Zaku II Shaku Yumiko Custom. Custom Zaku? Uh oh. Custom bright pink Zaku? A little odd, but after Char and Johnny Ridden, it'll frighten most dedicated players. Custom bright pink Zaku <a class="urllink" href="http://server2.uploadit.org/files/necropenguin-ZakuIISHAKU.jpg">decorated with bright pink hearts<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>â—Š</small>? Not so scary, especially since its damage and speed is the same as normal Zaku IIs and it can be carved up by an experienced GM pilot with a bullpup machinegun. Its distinguishing feature? An I-field powerful enough that it can sit down in front of a Big Zam and smile smugly, because with said I-field it takes minimal damage from beam weapons, and thus can tear apart beam-only/beam-dominant mobile suits like the Gundam Blue Destiny units or Gundam Physalis.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundamVsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundamVsSeries">Gundam Extreme Vs</a></em> has the old fan favorite joke MS, the Acguy, as a playable suit. However, while in most games the Acguy appears weak and pathetic, here it is fairly fast and has three different Support MS's it can call up, meaning you can easily find yourself Zerg Rushed by Acguy variants.
<ul><li> <em>Extreme Vs. Full Boost</em> adds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">Patrick Colasour</a>'s GN-XIII from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Gundam 00</a></em> to the mix via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DLC">DLC</a>. Like the Acguy, it's ranked in the lowest of the game's four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers">Character Tiers</a>, meaning it has comparatively low damage output and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a>. However, it has exceptional mobility thanks to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoABarrelRoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoABarrelRoll">barrel roll</a> maneuver, a temporary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>, and can have seemingly infinite ammunition if the player carefully manages its two guns (its GN lance machinegun and GN beam rifle). On top of everything else, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> involves grappling the enemy and exploding, dealing massive damage at the cost of reducing the GN-XIII to 1 HP, just like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">one of the more famous instances of this trope</a>.
</li><li> The RX-78-2 Gundam. The white devil of the One Year War will beat your ass. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">its original series</a>, its beam rifle was said to be as powerful as a battleship's main gun; <em>A.C.E.</em> reflects this by giving the rifle a <strong>starting</strong> attack power of 10,000 â€” which puts it on par with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Freedom and Justice Gundams</a>' (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaExpansionPack">with METEORs</a>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">Alpha Strike</a>, and makes it <em>more</em> powerful than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Wing Zero</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">twin buster rifle</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AfterWarGundamX">Gundam Double X</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">twin satellite cannon</a>, weapons capable of erasing large chunks of the landscape.

<ul><li> Cut from the US version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetsOfRage">Streets of Rage 3</a></em> is Ash, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyGay">Manly Gay</a> character who runs and screams like a girl and has a limited move set (no air attacks). However, his main attack, a love tap, can tear bosses apart in seconds!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuardianHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuardianHeroes">Guardian Heroes</a></em>, there are several joke characters, including Nando the bunny. However, if one were to go into 6-player versus mode with a team of at least three Nandos, that player will DOMINATE everyone else. Nando is incredibly tiny and has virtually no delay time between punches. Three or more at time can hit any character so many times that they won't be able move and it's inescapable. This even includes the couple of gods the player can use.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Almond</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoituLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoituLove">Noitu Love</a> 2</em>, who can't attack at all and spends the whole game simply having to dodge everything. However, he can put up a projectile-blocking shield around himself at will just by ducking, and to make up for his inability to attack, the player can attack enemies directly much like a mouse-controlled lightgun shooter, and even pick him up and carry him around with the right mouse button.
</li><li> The Novice class in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokBattleOffline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokBattleOffline">Ragnarok Battle Offline</a></em> seems to be completely true to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">the source material</a> at a glance, having terrible HP and MP, slow and weak attacks (Some of which result in them tripping or knocking themselves out), an extremely slow ground movement speed (Some characters can <em>walk</em> faster then either gender can dash), and only two skills, one of which is practically useless due to it only resorting a measly five HP per use (In a game where HP goes into the thousands range). However, once you place enough points in the right stats, they become capable of busting out highly destructive special attacks that can clear most of the screen in a single use, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">assuming you know the button inputs</a> (Though as they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHP" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHP">Cast From HP</a>, they can only be abused to the fullest with the aid of an Acolyte ally who can heal them). The male Novice also has a sweetspot on one of his basic air attacks that makes it deal a massive amount of damage (A fact the female Novice compensates for by being a more competent fighter overall).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza0" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza0">Yakuza 0</a></em> has a fairly substantial minigame that involves managing a cabaret club, hiring various women you meet through sidequests as hostesses. One woman you hire is Etsuko, an elderly woman with a leopard-print sweater and dyed purple hair who repeatedly inconvenienced and then tried to hit on Majima. Based on all this, you'd think she'd make a terrible hostess (Majima himself outright calls her an "anti-boner"), but she's actually one of the best hostesses in the game, boasting impressive HP, talk (having the highest possible score even at level 1,) and party stats that make her almost vital when going against Club Mercury and Club Venus.

<ul><li> In the PS1 video game Digimon Card game, the Rare tribe had some elements of this, with awful stats but some interesting support effects. In particular Numemon and Toy Agumon. Numemon was the usual monster that looked like poop and had stats to match, but when played from your hand as support forced the opponent to discard 2 cards in their evolution pile. On its own, card advantage and a delicious way to mess up your opponents tempo while you beat up their underevolved mons, run a bunch of them and you can force your opponent to use almost nothing but rookies, except with the odd champion for the rest of the duel. Toy Agumon had unimpressive stats but the broken effect of making both mons' HP 200, meaning you could one-hit KO the enemy even when they were an Ultimate or a tweaked out Armor Digimon, then heal next turn, possibly with another lethal joke card, Psychemonâ€” which changes your HP to make it the same as the opponent's.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/HearthstoneHeroesOfWarcraft">Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Angry Chicken. Normally it's an unimpressive card with 1 attack, 1 health, and a cost of 1 mana. But if you can buff its max health and damage it without killing it, its enrage feature kicks in and gives it +5 attack, turning it into a very cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.
</li><li> Murlocs have some of the lowest stats in the game, but they're generally cheap to play and some of them have synergies that work well with each other (some give stat boosts to other murlocs, others gain bonuses from being played alongside other murlocs, and still others bring more murlocs onto the field). Played properly, a murloc deck can crush an opponent in the early stages before the high-value cards make an appearance.
</li><li> Yogg-Saron was meant to be a worthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForFun">Just For Fun</a> card, and most players initially wrote him off as one. When he's played, he casts random spells on random targets per each spell you cast previously that game. The problem is, it couldn't pick illegal targets (you couldn't summon minions for your opponent, you couldn't use board clears on your minions, etc), and the majority of spells are purely beneficial. It turns out that it was a pretty much guaranteed board clear and card draw, and even if it whiffed, you usually were only playing it as a last resort, so it didn't matter. It turned the game into an RNG-fest where Yogg would come down and potentially win on the spot. Blizzard eventually nerfed him by making it so that he stopped casting if he died, got transformed, got returned to the hand, or got Silenced in the middle of casting, making much more of a normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>.
</li><li> Purify is a Priest card from <em>One Night in Karazhan</em> with the unimpressive effect of silencing a friendly minion and letting you draw a card. It quickly became known as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetically bad</a> card, especially since Priest already has the Silence card that silences any minion and costs no mana. But then <em>Journey to Un'Goro</em> came out with the card Humongous Razorleaf, a cheap card with huge stats and an effect that prevented it from attacking, and Lyra the Sunshard which put Priest spells in your hand when you played a spell. Combined with Ancient Watcher, another cheap, high stat minion that can't attack, they made Silence Priest decks viable. Players would play <em>both</em> Silence and Purify eithier to silence cards that needed it or as fuel for Lyra.
</li><li> Similarly, <em>Mean Streets of Gadgetzan</em> introduced Gadgetzan Ferryman, which returned one of your other minions to your hand if you played at least one other card earlier in the turn. The problem was, this card compared unfavorably to Youthful Brewmaster, who always returned an allied minion to your hand. Players derided this card the same way they derided Purify...and then <em>Journey to Un'Goro</em> came out with The Caverns Below. If you played enough minions with the same name, The Caverns Below turns into a card that supercharges all your current and future minions â€” but since you can only have two copies of a card, you would need to get played minions back into your hand somehow. It turned out that The Caverns Below's effect was <em>absolutely insane</em>, causing players to use both Youthful Brewmaster and Gadgetzan Ferryman in order to have enough return-minion-to-hand effects. Gadgetzan Ferryman would fall out of favor when The Caverns Below was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfed</a>, but for a time it was in one of the most powerful decks in Hearthstone.
</li><li> <em>Dirty Rat</em> is an overstatted 2 mana 2/6 Taunt that summons an enemy minion from your opponent's hand. Playing him on curve often results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> moment where your enemy gets an 8/8 <em>Lich King</em> or 12/12 <em>Tyrantus</em> for free. But he is one of the first cards that directly affects the opponent's hand, and if you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">Removal</a> ready, you can use him to drag out the enemy's key minion and get it killed, seriously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComboBreaker">throwing a wrench in their combo</a>. Even if you don't have a Removal ready, enemy minions played in such a way forfeits their Battlecry, so Warlocks who just finished unsealing <em>Azari the Devourer</em> is in serious risk of having their hard work undone thanks to this little rat. Likewise, Hecklebot and Unseen Saboteur have similar abilities (Hecklebot pulls from the deck, while Saboteur pulls out spells).
</li><li> King Togwaggle is an 8 mana 5/5 that swaps both players' decks around, but gives your opponent a King's Ransom to swap them back. Originally he was quite gimmicky (read: useless), but then Azalina Soulthief was released, a card with the effect of replacing your hand with a copy of your opponent's. One simple combo is to quickly draw through your entire deck, reduce either Azalina or Togwaggle's cost by 7 using Dreampetal Florist, then swap and copy their hand. If they try to swap back, you use the King's Ransom that Azalina created. Then, you just Naturalize or Coldlight Oracle to force your opponent to draw lots of cards from your empty deck, killing them.
</li><li> One of the upgrades you can pick up in The Great Dalaran Heist singleplayer mode is Wondrous Wisdomball, which depicts Khadgar making a silly face and has the description "Occasionally gives helpful advice." You're probably expecting him to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a>, and you might be made certain of this when you see him get triggered to say things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObvious">"Remember, when you run out of health, you lose!"</a> However, Khadgar's actual effect is randomly activating when certain conditions are fulfilled... and the effects he provides include things like drawing more cards, doubling spells cast, reducing costs, duplicating stuff you play, or nuking the enemy field. He's random, but even one or two activations will put you into a winning position. And throughout it all, it's played as "advice."

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159177">High Tide<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Initially easy to overlook (<em>Fallen Empires</em> was not a particularly popular set), later expansions brought assorted super powerful cards which this card would then fuel. Combined with several similar cards, it led to the ubiquitous "Combo Winter" era in the game's history.
</li><li> An even bigger <em>Magic</em> example is <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2478">Necropotence.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It famously got one star out of five from <em>InQuest</em> magazine. The very existence of this card taught players two very good lessons: one card is worth more than one life, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">the only life point that matters is the last</a>. Once the Necrodeck became the strongest deck in Type 2 play, <em>Inquest</em> revised the card's score to <em>five stars.</em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lrc0');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lrc0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lrc0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">If you want to theorise a reason for this misjudgement, a likely explanation is that they didn't think about the card properly- read in a vacuum, one use of Necropotence's ability is terrible, as it comes with a huge number of harsh penalties (loss of the normal draw, cards are removed from the game instead of going to the graveyard, cards "drawn" with Necropotence at the cost of life aren't even added to your hand until the end of the turn), and indeed after you've filled your hand with Necropotence it becomes a heavy liability that you ideally want to get rid of again (aside for the usual reasons mono-black decks needed it, the classic Necrodeck included <a class="urllink" href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159266">Nevinyrral's Disk<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in part to remove its own Necropotence). It wasn't until they thought about it laterally and realised that there was no limit on the number of cards Necropotence could give you in one go apart from the amount of life you had to spend (and the 7-card hand limit) that they understood that you were accepting the card's considerable drawbacks in exchange for <em>instantly refilling your hand from empty to full!</em></span>
</li><li> Yet another example: The card <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=15168">Donate.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Who knew that giving away your own cards could be so effective?
<ul><li> Donate is at its best when paired with yet another Lethal Joke Card, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2515">Illusions of Grandeur;<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the combo turns a temporary life-boost into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>. This particular combo is the basis of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Trix</a>" decktype, which was considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> at the time.
</li><li> Speaking of Donate, there's <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=198364">Bazaar Trader,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who does the same thing with an added utility you'd never think of: you can target yourself with his ability. Red has a lot of cards that take control of an enemy's creatures for just one turn, but if you give those temporarily stolen cards to yourself with Bazaar Trader, the permanent effect overrides the temporary one and you get to keep the creature until the end of the game.

The 'thopter's real value for combos is that it has zero cost - and you won't necessarily be using it for <em>attacking</em>. Hint: <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring%20Renewal">Enduring Renewal.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> In addition, it fuels cards like <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound%20Ravager">Arcbound Ravager<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and other components of the Affinity / Robots decks, including <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial%20Plating">Cranial Plating,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which made it into a lethal evasive attacker.

<ul><li> Ornithopter's status as one of Magic's most infamous Lethal Joke Characters earned it a <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=425813">spot in the Masterpiece Series: Kaladesh Inventions,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a set of foil reprints at Mythic rarity featuring some of the most popular and powerful artifacts in Magic's history.

Seeing as most competitive decks are two or three colors to avoid either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverSpecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverSpecialization">Crippling Over Specialization</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone">Master of None</a> and lands, which make up about a third of most decks, are classed as colorless, the extra cards were rarely achieved. Players put two and two together and built a deck that could win on turn 3.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3255">Lion's Eye Diamond<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is the most infamous example of this in <em>Magic</em>. It was meant to be a useless "balanced" version of the <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=600">Black Lotus,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> giving you free mana at the price of discarding your entire hand, leaving you with no spells to spend your mana on. <em>InQuest</em> magazine called it the worst card in the Mirage expansion set, and it was often cited as the prime example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JunkRare">Junk Rare</a> in its early years. Then people realized that once you could get around the lose your hand drawback, the LED was basically an unrestricted Black Lotus. It didn't take long for the Lion's Eye Diamond to land in the Banned and Restricted lists once people figured out how to do that, especially after various cards were made that allowed spells to be cast from the graveyard, played around with the Discard mechanic, and did other such shenanigans that turned the LED's drawback into a boon. Nowadays, the Lion's Eye Diamond is a permanent resident of the Vintage Restricted list, a common sight in the Legacy scene, and the most expensive card in the Mirage expansion set.
</li><li> Wizards of the Coast took a while to learn the lesson of "Black Lotus is really, really broken"; their next attempt at creating a "fixed" Black Lotus, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4614">Lotus Petal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which only produces one mana before going to the graveyard, also ended up broken (and restricted in Vintage), as it would still allow for free mana and could combo with various other cards (including storm cards, which copies itself for each other spell you cast in a turn, and cards like Yawgmoth's Bargain, which allows you to re-use your sacrificed Lotus Petals).
</li><li> Because they couldn't very well leave well enough alone, they tried again in Time Spiral. <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370562">Lotus Bloom<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a Black Lotus which took three extra turns to come into play. This also ended up creating an overpowered deck in combination with cards with the storm mechanic, particularly the otherwise unwieldy <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370537">Dragonstorm<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Normally, you can't really cast any other spells in the same turn as you cast a 9 casting cost spell, but the Lotus Blooms are *free*...

Even its "Delve" ability, which lets the player exile cards from their graveyard to pay for its cost, doesn't do much when it's a 5/5 creature for 7 mana with no means of evasion or special abilities. However, put it in formats like Modern or Legacy, where decks can rack up a fair number of cards in their graveyard just by playing, and it shows its true power. In decks that get tons of cards into their graveyard, like Delver or Hollow One, the Angler is a 5/5 that dodges most removal and can be played for as little as 2 or 3 mana.

This is gimmicky but surprisingly effective when played with the outdated VWXYZ cards... and downright ridiculous when played with the tournament-winning ABC cards.
<ul><li> There's also four cards based off of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Parodius">Parodius</a>, resembling four plastic men riding paper airplanes. <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Soitsu">Two of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Aitsu">them are<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Normal Monsters with almost no attack or defense, but <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Doitsu">the other<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Koitsu">two are<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Union Monsters (monsters that can turn themselves into Equip cards) and when unioned to the others, make them <em>impressively</em> powerful.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Skull_Servant">Skull Servants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. These are well known as being among the weakest monsters in the game with no effect, low stats, and no support. Various aspects of the game treat them as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>... Until the release of <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/King_of_the_Skull_Servants">King of the Skull Servants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a creature that gains 1000 attack points for every Skull Servant in your graveyard, as well as every King of the SS. After that there was <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Lady_in_Wight">Lady in Wight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wightmare">Wightmare<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who both are treated as Skull Servant while in the graveyard. This means that with all of these cards in the grave, King can easily become a monster with <em>11000</em> attack points. To put this in perspective, This is over twice as much as the highest attack in the game. Later releases raise the ante with the addition of <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wightprince">Wightprince<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wightprincess">Wightprincess<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, buffing King's potential max ATK to <strong>17000</strong>.
</li><li> Similarly, there's <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mokey_Mokey">Mokey Mokey<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. A 300/100 fairy with no effects. Its flavor text says "Sometimes he gets mad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThatsTerrible">and that is dreadful</a>." But then its support cards come in - three Mokey Mokeys can be fused to create <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mokey_Mokey_King">Mokey Mokey King<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which despite having the same low stats allows you to summon as many Mokey Mokeys as you have in your graveyard when it leaves the field (destroyed, returned to the deck, etc.), and the spell card <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mokey_Mokey_Smackdown">Mokey Mokey Smackdown<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> increases Mokey Mokey's attack to <em>3000</em> for 1 turn if a fairy type monster you control is destroyed. The official ruling is that if a Mokey Mokey is summoned after the effect is activated, it gets the effect too. Chain all three together and you probably get very close to beating your opponent in 1 round.
</li><li> Low-level Normal Monsters in general qualify. Low stats? You bet. No effects? Comes with the territory. But they are <em>fast.</em> Cards like <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Common_Charity">Common Charity<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/White_Elephant%27s_Gift">White Elephant's Gift<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Underdog">Heart of the Underdog<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> give them a surprising amount of draw power, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">Human-Wave</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Human-Wave_Tactics">Tactics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_League_of_Uniform_Nomenclature">The League of Uniform Nomenclature<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Enchanting_Fitting_Room">Enchanting Fitting Room<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> make filling the field with them easy. Level 1 Monsters are favored thanks to a little card called <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Triangle_Power">Triangle Power<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which boosts their ATK and DEF by 2000 at the cost of destroying them later... which slots in well with ace card <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Law_of_the_Normal">The Law of the Normal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Law can only be played when you have five Level 2 or lower Normals, but it destroys all cards on the field and in both player's hands except those Normals. Play Triangle Power, then Law, and your opponent will be facing down a combined total of over 10,000 ATK with nothing to defend themselves.
<ul><li> A variation of this is a trio of cards: <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Oppressed_People">Oppressed People<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/People_Running_About">People Running About<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/United_Resistance">United Resistance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. All three are weak, effect-less, and common... but they have a personal Trap, <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Huge_Revolution">Huge Revolution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, that can only be used when all three are together. It nukes your opponent's entire hand and field.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rescue_Cat">Rescue Cat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> might be the most famous example. When it was created, most players dismissed it as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon">Com Mon</a> with horrendous stats and a third-rate effect, utterly ignored even in Beast decks and only considered notable for its absurdly cute looks. Come Synchro Monsters and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/X-Saber_Airbellum">X-Saber Airbellum<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in particular, and Rescue Cat jumped from cutesy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMon">Com Mon</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> overnight. Its effect? Tribute it to summon two low-level Beasts, which are destroyed at the end of the turn. That's an instant Level 6 Synchro (and later, Rank 3 Xyz), right off the bat, just by itself, on a monster weak enough to be searched by dozens of effects. It's even <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rescue_Hamster">spawned a<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rescue_Ferret">series of<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Ridiculously Cute Critter</a> monsters with similar effects, one of which (<a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rescue_Rabbit">Rescue Rabbit<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) had its own tournament-winning deck and remains a staple in Normal Monster-focused decks.
</li><li> The anime, and some of the video games, featured the Ancient Treasure cards: <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Crystal_Skull">Crystal Skull<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ashoka_Pillar">Ashoka Pillar<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Cabrera_Stone">Cabrera Stone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. They all have 0 ATK, all except Ashoka Pillar have 0 DEF, and they deal damage to you when they're Summoned or destroyed. The trick is that the damage they deal is pretty damn high, and if you have the right cards, such as <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Barrel_Behind_the_Door">Barrel Behind the Door<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spell_of_Pain">Spell of Pain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, you can easily redirect it to your opponent. If you get all three out, you can activate <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Triangle_O">Triangle - O<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which destroys all cards on the field and redirects the damage to the opponent, most likely taking a massive bite out of your opponent's LP.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gift_Card">Gift Card<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> increases your opponent's LP by 3000, which sounds like an extremely counterproductive idea... if not for cards like <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Darklord_Nurse_Reficule">Darklord Nurse Reficule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bad_Reaction_to_Simochi">Bad Reaction to Simochi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which reverse all LP gain for your opponent into damage. Three Gift Cards in combination with Reficule or Simochi can take down the opponent in one turn.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mind_Control">Mind Control<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is probably the closest counterpart to Lion's Eye Diamond. It was a "balanced" (read: useless) version of the incredibly strong <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Change_of_Heart">Change of Heart<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Brain_Control">Brain Control<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>: it let you steal an opponent's monster for a turn, but since you couldn't attack with it or Tribute it (the things you want to do with a stolen card), this was pretty meaningless. But then Synchro Summon was added to the game, which let you use the stolen monster in a way that didn't count as Tributing - steal an opponent's card, play a Tuner, and Tune them. Your opponent lost a card, you got material for a strong card. Mind Control is now limited to one.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Kuriboh">Kuriboh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was this in the original series, to the point that Pegasus was actually shocked when he realized that someone used it. As it turned out, the Kuriboh's notoriously low stats also made it a perfect target for <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Multiply">Multiply<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a combo that Yugi won multiple games with. One tiny fuzzball isn't much - an infinitely-replicating horde of tiny fuzzballs is another thing entirely. The real card also counts; its effect is a proto-Swift Scarecrow, it can be instantly searched with <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/The_Flute_of_Summoning_Kuriboh">The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the Multiply combo does exist in real life. Add <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Detonate">Detonate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and watch five of your opponent's cards die.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Winged_Kuriboh">Winged Kuriboh<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> might count as well. If destroyed in battle, you are safe from any further battle damage for the turn, and can be Special Summoned with The Flute of Summoning Kuriboh... and it comes with a much more powerful upgrade, <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Winged_Kuriboh_LV10">Winged Kuriboh LV10<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is much more lethal. LV10 requires <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Transcendent_Wings">Transcendent Wings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has the same stats as Winged Kuriboh (let's be fair, you don't summon Winged Kuriboh LV10 for its raw brute-force), but comes with a highly powerful effect: During your opponent's battle phase, you can tribute it to destroy all their face-up attack position monsters and inflict damage equal to the combined ATK of all destroyed monsters. This basically makes it a much more powerful (albeit slightly harder-to-play) version of <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mirror_Force">Mirror Force<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Combine that with <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Battle_Mania">Battle Mania<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a trap that forces your opponent's monsters into attack position and makes your opponent unable to skip their battle phase, and chances are pretty big that you can defeat your opponent during their own turn.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Number_30:_Acid_Golem_of_Destruction">Number 30 - Acid Golem of Destruction<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> appears to be the embodiment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> at first glance. It has very good stats for a Rank 3, but it blocks off all your own Special Summons, it requires you to detach an Xyz material each turn or take 2000 damage, and once it's out of materials, it can't attack, so its stats are meaningless. So play <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Creature_Swap">Creature Swap<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and give it to your opponent, meaning now <em>they</em> have a useless monster that shuts down their strategies and kills them in four turns. You can even use <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bahamut_Shark">Bahamut Shark<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to bring out a material-less Acid Golem right off the bat, ready to make your opponent suffer.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lava_Golem">Lava Golem<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was originally suppose to be an extremely gimmicky card; tribute two of your <em>opponent's</em> monster to summon him....to their side of the field. It then slowly bleeds them for 1000 points per turn. While it sounded pretty scary on paper, it also came with 3000 ATK....a stat that, at the time, only the legendary <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes_White_Dragon">Blue Eyes White Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> naturally possessed. So unless you figured out some way of restraining the golem, the enemy could just quickly beat you to death with your own card. It quickly faded into obscurity because of this drawback until a lot of later monsters came out with blanket immunity to destruction effects. See, Lava Golem's ability was technically <em>tributing</em>, which not only did <em>not</em> count as Destroying (hence bypassing a lot of immunities) but also counted as being a cost (so only effects that specifically forbad a monster from being tributed can counter it) letting it also bypass blanket effect immunities. And the Golem's impressive stats are no longer as impressive due to the power creep. And even then, a 3000 ATK monster with absolutely no innate defenses is much easier to get rid of than, say, one of the Egyptian God cards.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Duston">The Dustons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> of the Ojamas, and work pretty similarly. They all have 0/0 stats, can't be Tributed or used for most types of Extra Deck summoning, and when they're destroyed, their controller suffers a detrimental effect. They sound completely useless, but this comes together with the card <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/House_Duston">House Duston<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which summons a bunch of Dustons to both players' sides of the field when destroyed. This means you can instantly flood your opponent's board with useless monsters, and when you add in <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Goblin_King">Goblin King<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which gains 1000 ATK for every Fiend in play) or <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Starduston">Starduston<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which gains 1000 for every Duston sent to summon it), it can follow up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.

However, much later, hefty ATK-boosting cards <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wetlands">Wetlands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Token_Stampede">Token Stampede<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were released, and Slime Tokens are among the few things that can benefit from both, turning them from 500-ATK liabilities to 2700+ indestructible powerhouses. It's a long way from effective in competitive play, but against more casual opponents, beating down your opponent with a Slime Token is well worth it.
</li></ul></li><li> From the online card collection strategy game <em>Poxnora</em> there is a Champion called the "Magma Bunny" that had stats well below average for the Mana Cost. However, it had the ability to split off a copy (splitting its HP), and if you upgraded a useless ability you could pump its Mana Cost to huge levels. Senseless? Perhaps, except for two spells, one that sacrificed a champion to refund the full Mana Cost, and another spell that sacrifices a champion and deals damage equal to the Mana Cost to the nearest enemy champion. And each copy cloned off of the original had the same mana cost as the original. Then there also happened to be another (in most circumstances crappy) spell that allowed you to keep redeploying your Magma Bunny after Sacrificing it, over and over again. That Deck became known as the "Bunnies of DOOM!" Finally the mechanics were nerfed.
</li><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pokemon">PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game</a> comes Durant, the source of the <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Durant_Mill_%28TCG%29">Durant Mill<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The most Durant can deal is a pathetic 20 damage in an era where 100 damage or more is commonplace, and with only 70 HP, has less than half of the main attackers in the majority of popular tournament decks. Its potential, however, lies in its attack that doesn't deal damage: For each Durant the player has in play, "Devour" makes the opponent discard cards from the top of his or her deck. As there can be up to 4 Durants in play at a time, the opponent must discard up to 4 cards for each "Devour." Combine this with the card drawn at the beginning of each turn and search cards that burn through decks like <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Juniper_%28Black_%26_White_101%29">Professor Juniper<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and the Durant Mill became the only deck to see wide tournament play in the card game's entire history to create wins through depletion of the opponent's deck rather than knocking out PokÃ©mon. Considering that Durant is ranked as Uncommon, the second-lowest rarity in the game, odds are the card designers didn't realize Durant's potential either. Durant became such a problem that a <a class="urllink" href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Heatmor_%28Dark_Explorers_19%29">Heatmor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> card was produced specifically to eliminate Durant Mill decks. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It didn't work.</span>
<ul><li> In the Phantom Forces expansion, the Night March attack turns Pumpkaboo and Joltik into this. Night March does 20 base damage, with a multiplier based on the number of cards with the Night March attack the player has in their discard pile. Paired with the Battle Compressor trainer card, which allows you to search your deck for three cards and put them straight into your discard pile, and the Ultra Ball, which makes you discard two cards from your hand to get a PokÃ©mon from your deck, you can potentially very quickly set these mons up for impressive damage. Most people rocking a Night March deck will put Lampent, a stage 1 evolution that has Night March, into their deck without any Litwick, just to be able to discard them. With four Pumpkaboo, four Joltik, four Lampent, and four Battle Compressors, you could potentially have a 30HP Joltik dealing 220 damage before factoring in weakness or resistance.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Omastar_(Majestic_Dawn_26)">The Omastar released in the Majestic Dawn set<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, when put into play, would take all of the opponent's evolved PokÃ©mon on their Bench and devolve them by one stage, with the evolutions returning to their hands. On paper, this isn't really that powerful, since it doesn't deal with the opponent's Active PokÃ©mon, and they can just evolve them back the next turn. This Omastar started seeing wide tournament play, however, with <a class="urllink" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Empoleon_(Platinum_26)">Empoleon from the Platinum set<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose "Jet Smash" attack deals 70 damage to any of the opponent's PokÃ©mon. While Empoleon cannot use "Jet Smash" on consecutive turns, nearly all not-fully-evolved PokÃ©mon at that point had 70 HP or less, providing the player with the ability to KO almost anything they wanted. This was particularly valuable if there was a PokÃ©mon on the opponent's Bench providing useful passive abilities, since, of course, knocking them out would also shut them down.
</li><li> Exeggcute from Plasma Freeze also deserves mention. It has very low 30 HP and one attack that does 20 damage for two energy, and the Exeggutor it's supposed to evolve into isn't too impressive, either. Except its ability "Propagation" lets you return it from the discard pile to your hand. This opens the door to a myriad of combos that involve cards and abilities requiring you to discard resources in order to work, which when combined with Battle Compressor can give you free uses of cards like Ultra Ball. Because of this, it's tough to find an Expanded deck that doesn't have a copy or two, just because of how useful it is.

<ul><li> Helix from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ARMS">ARMS</a></em> is a green, boneless alien who that looks like a useless joke character, but his true strengths are hidden below the surface. At the expense of mobility, Helix can duck and stretch, avoiding attacks with high potential for counterattack when used properly.
</li><li> Naru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BattleArenaToshinden">Battle Arena Toshinden</a> 3</em> is one of these, by virtue of being the last unlockable character in the game. She's very small and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlacierWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlacierWaif">carries a comparatively big sword</a>, making her attacks slow. But her size also makes her harder to hit and quick on her feet, allowing her to literally run circles around her opponents than perform the few second long dodge roll all characters are able to perform. Along with having a broken ability to instantly throw opponents by making them eat the floor by dragging them by the foot and with greater recovery, her fighting style is close to that of her adopted father Kayin with an emphasis on priority special moves with more reach, so characters who know how to master him should be able to fight as Naru no problem.
</li><li> At first glance, Yachiru in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a>: Blade of Fate</em> seems worthless. She has two moves, a dash attack and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Battle Aura</a>, and one super that's a stronger version of the aura. If you use her personal Spirit Card deck, however, you'll see it's all Stability (which prevents her attacks from being stopped if she gets hit) and Spirit Pressure Increase. That's the trick â€” use her dash to corner her opponent, then bust out her super, and the opponent can't escape taking <em>every hit</em>. If you have three super bars, that's most of their health. No wonder she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBruiser">Cute Bruiser</a>.
<ul><li> Sadly, <em>Dark Souls</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">nerfed</a> her. Personal Spirit Card decks were removed, her attacks have much more wind-up, and she randomly <em>trips</em>, regulating her to normal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> status. Amusingly, Hanataro can make a claim to this status - unlike <em>Shattered Blade</em>, he only has two attacks that heal the enemy, and one of his special attacks inflicts paralysis, which is like a "Free Air Combo" ticket.
</li><li> Even in <em>Shattered Blade</em>, Hanataro can make this claim. If used correctly, he can be one of the most powerful characters in the game. His special attack can inflict over half a health bar's worth of damage. This is only beaten out by Byakuya's Bankai attack, which is really saying something.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodyRoar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BloodyRoar">Bloody Roar</a>: Primal Fury</em> manages to include a joke boss. In a tournament filled with shapeshifters who can turn into man-tigers or wherewolves, his basic beast form is....a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithPenguins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithPenguins">penguin</a>? Not a human-sized penguin, or a superfast penguin, or one who hits supernaturally hard. It's about two-feet tall and squeaks. It attacks with wingslaps. His normal human form is a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">bishie</a>, too, and not particularly strong with abrupt combos. Except a two foot tall penguin coincidentally happens to be far too short for most attacks, even many special powers It can't be grabbed, and thus is very easy to turtle with. It can be hard to predict, and will interrupt enemy combos with its wussy slaps. In some cases, you can force enemies to turn around while continuing their combo, leaving them open. His Hyper Beast Mode is a short-lived, human-sized phoenix with a one-hit kill. And it's <em>still</em> a downgrade from the penguin!
<ul><li> Uriko debuted as the first game's final boss (against her will) and was unable to complete her transforation in subsequent games, so she looks like a token <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Catgirl">catgirl</a> instead of a weretiger (and acts like the former as well). Many of her techniques cause her to lose her balance or leave her dizzy, regardless of whether they were succesful. But her basic and beast combos are infinitely chainable at the right tempo, and can keep all but the perfectly-timed opponent juggled 'til their lifebar is gone.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaJudgment">Castlevania: Judgment</a></em> has Maria Renard. Not only is she a silly character in general (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch">Cute Witch</a> ina <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GothicHorror">Gothic Horror</a> setting), her attacks are quirky and even prone to misfiring, causing her to break her own combos. But, if handled properly and kept at the right range, she can devastate her opponents.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeathVegas">Death Vegas</a></em> has <em>two</em> lethal joke characters: Duff, a fat guy wearing a Hawaiian shirt and a crown, and Lourdes, a cleaning lady wielding a plunger. Both of them have nasty counterattacks and are capable of holding their own against a roster that includes a karate expert, an martial artist assassin, a tazer-packing FBI agent, and a 'roided-up boxer.
</li><li> Jefailey from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Divekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Divekick">Divekick</a></em> was meant to be a poser, like Dan Hibiki. His kicks have a pitiful reach unless they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChargedAttack">charged beforehand</a>, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">head inflating with each win</a> to make him a bigger target! Even S-Kill, who's obsessed with nerfing the other characters, found that he can't possibly nerf Jefailey any further and actually offered to <em>buff</em> him. On the flip side, however, said head inflation also makes him jump higher, almost rivaling Dr. Schoals' massive rocket jump on his fourth win. His kicks also arc instead of traveling straight forward, which can trip people up, and if charged can make him fly almost the entire width of the screen. His Ground Technique also freezes time for everything but the clock, which can help secure a win by time out.
</li><li> Most of the games in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokai"> Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</a></em> series have at least one of these. Ginyu could qualify in the first four games â€” simply let the opponent beat him up, use Body Change (which switches the characters' respective health bars), and finish what your opponent started. This was heavily nerfed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokaiTenkaichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallZBudokaiTenkaichi">Tenkaichi 2</a></em>, however, to the point where the move is practically useless. That game's example of this trope is Videl, whom most players quickly dismiss because she has no long-range offense whatsoever, has a very small health bar, and has a weak short-range offense. However, she's fast. VERY fast. As in "can string together 30-hit combos with minimal effort and finish them with a 75-hit combo" fast. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Those hits may be weak, but they add up.</a> Against a competent Videl, most opponents aren't even given a chance to breathe during their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a>, much less mount any form of offense themselves.
<ul><li> Mr. Satan. Unlike every other character in the <em>Tenkaichi</em> series, his standard combo has no knockback whatsoever (on top of doing next to no damage). His Ultimate Blast can be either pathetic... or do only <strong>1</strong> damage. At first glance it seems his only saving grace is Present For You, a Blast 2 that can counter any close-range attack with a powerful bomb. Problem with that is, Mr. Satan has a Blast 1 called False Courage that makes him <em>immune to knockback</em>. At long range, he can simply dodge everything and not care about what does manage to hit. At medium range, he can use a rush Blast 2 that has a tremendous amount of knockback (and in the meantime, he's charging energy to re-use it). At close range, Present For You. Game, set, match.
</li><li> This also applies to Videl in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallRagingBlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonBallRagingBlast">Raging Blast 2</a></em>. While most see her as weak, she can combo opponents repeatedly into paralysis with a combination of melee and her signature skill. Her signature skill is a series of kicks that leave the opponent unable to counter and can be combo-ed with itself until you run out of ki, potentially getting combos in the hundreds of hits.
</li><li> Yajirobe in the anime was an obese man with a sword and no powers besides good training, who fell into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">Can't Catch Up</a> faster than anyone else. He's quite possibly the weakest Z Warrior. <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 2</em> Yajirobe seems like he'd be a gag character at first glance (since Yajirobe couldn't fly in the series, this version does flying sequences by <em>dog-paddling the air</em>), but once you experiment a bit with him, you find that he has the fastest stock recovery in the game, letting him hurl out moves like candy - including a full heal through eating senzu beans. Yajirobe is even labelled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> by some for this potency.
</li><li> Tarble from <em>Raging Blast 2</em> also counts. For those who don't know, Tarble is Vegeta's younger brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteSheep">who was outcast for being too weak and kindhearted</a>. Overall he plays like a weaker version of Vegeta with moves that are similar to his brother's, but weaker and sometimes with less effect. What drives him into this role, however, are two of his special techniques: Wild Sense and Energy Booster. Wild Sense allows him to instantly dodge any move that would otherwise connect and Energy Booster boosts the damage of his rush and ki attacks. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">If you combine the two with his relatively quick moves, decent ki consumption rates and toss in his Explosive Wave and Galick Burst for emergency defense and ambushes, then Tarble becomes every bit as viable a fighter as anyone else.</a>
</li><li> Akkuman/Spike in <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em> is at best unremarkable and at worst simply bad in most respects, even by the standards of a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> character. However, he has one particular move - the Devilmite Beam. In the series, the Devilmite Beam was powered by the "dark thoughts" of the target, which proved completely ineffective against Goku's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a>. In the game, this was translated into it being far more powerful against "evil" characters such as Buu or Frieza. Against most characters, Spike is quite weak, but against villains, he can easily manage a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.
</li><li> Also in <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em> there is Arale Norimaki of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DrSlump">Dr. Slump</a></em>. She has low HP, weak attacks, very little variety in attacks, short reach with her melee attacks, a basic special attack which is slow and easily dodged, weak flying and being an android she can not charge KI. But she has 2 things which make her lethal: she is small and she is fast. This allows her to avoid most attacks simply by running around. She can keep doing this until she can use her basic special, which while near useless at range is near instant cast making it dangerous if you run in and use it at point blank range while your opponent is missing you with their special. It will knock the opponent over allowing you time for a quick retreat. Her weak flying also comes into play when combined with her size as any opponent taller than her (which is the majority) will be unable to complete a combo on her in mid-air as long as the player ceases any input, causing her to quickly fall below their attacks mid-combo leaving them wide open to her special. The result is a character very suited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">hit and run combat.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Fighting game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalChampions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalChampions">Eternal Champions</a> 2</em> (also known as <em>Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side</em>) had, as an unlockable character, Crispy, a chicken with no special moves and not many <em>regular</em> moves to speak of. But he was also so small that the majority of moves couldn't hit him, and opponents could only block his attacks while crouching (unless he jumped). Crispy was supposed to be just a cute novelty character, but he was ridiculously-hard to beat, even when used by an inexperienced player. He was practically invincible in the hands of someone who knew what they were doing. <em>2</em> also introduced a buggy "juggling" mechanic, and Crispy was fast enough to easily juggle his oppnents. Yet too too small for other characters to juggle.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a>: Battle Assault 2</em>, the player can unlock such powerful cheese machines like the Big Zam, Epyon, deceptively-ridiculous Zeong, the f***ing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Dark Gundam</a>, the more under-the-radar Hydra Gundam, the Missile spam crazy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Heavyarms Custom</a>, and the custom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Psycho Gundam Mk. III</a>. Sharing the spotlight with these titans of argh is... a Ball, piloted by barely-above-no-name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Shiro Amada</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Not to denigrate his status as a pilot or a protagonist</a>, but Shiro isn't exactly on a par with Newtypes like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Char</a> or zombie-cyborgs like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">Major Ulube</a> or even pretty boy aces like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Treize Kushrenada</a>. Still, people fear the Ball, all for one reason: sheer speed. Ball is the second-fastest character in the game, and has a trick by which it can stop its vernier boost and rapidly descend with an attack. This lightning-fast cross-up could then be canceled into his damaging jackhammer attack or his even-more-damaging 120mm cannon shot. Even without any mega-specials and pitiful defense, the trusty Ball managed to crush almost anyone in its path.
<ul><li> Likewise, the Ball of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundamVsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GundamVsSeries">Federation vs. Zeon</a></em> has the lowest armor and most limited weaponry of any suit, while being slow and having rather limited boost power. A Rick Dom or most Mobile Armors can blow it up in a single shot. It's mostly in-game for plot purposes. It can still be ridiculously lethal in the right hands, though, since where you'd only get a couple Rick Doms, players using the Ball get at least six, and often many more, all of which are small targets devoted to long-range attacks. They can only take down real mobile suits by nibbling them to death, but they <em>can</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">nibble things to death</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Shigechi in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JoJosBizarreAdventureAllStarBattle">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle</a></em>. A small, fat, really weird-looking high school student, Shigechi has the Stand Harvest, which manifests as a bunch of tiny insect-men. They're expended for his special attacks, which forces him to constantly replenish them - and the move to do so leaves him open for a split-second. However, he's short, and (unlike Iggy) his hitbox reflects this - high attacks <em>can't touch him</em> when he's on the ground. Many of his attacks hit low, which is an advantage because many players rarely think to block low. One of his special attacks drops stuff on the enemy - which makes it an overhead in a game where there are <em>not</em> a surfeit of overheads. For a character who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">died horribly only a few chapters after his introduction</span>, Shigechi is surprisingly able to hold his own.

However, being a bird, he's the only character in the game who can fly seamlessly around the battlefield, meaning he's able to dodge just about any attack by simply flying over it, and has some of the most spammable moves in the game, one of which is incredibly powerful. The tourneys for the game actually consider him to be the highest tiered character. Some even have him banned from use in competitive play.

Despite this (or perhaps because of it), it managed to win Nintendo's poll for what the final ability in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyBattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyBattleRoyale">Kirby Battle Royale</a></em> should be, and was given a full moveset for the first time ever. Said moveset includes a large and hard-to-avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnotBubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnotBubble">Snot Bubble</a> projectile, a grapple move that makes opponents fall asleep, and an automatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that can be used infinitely. Keep in mind the only other way to heal in this game is via an item that can only be used once per game.

Despite all these complications, however, collecting three pieces of evidence and landing a clean hit with an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWordShout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigWordShout">OBJECTION!</a>" allows him to access <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Turnabout Mode</a>, which has an exponential damage boost, allows super move variants, and unlocks the use of Ace Attorney, the most damaging move in the whole game, which cannot miss. Phoenix Wright's damage and speed boost when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComebackMechanic">activating X-Factor</a> is staggeringly high when he is the last man on his team, and if Ace Attorney is used while in X-Factor, he can knock out any character even if they have a full HP bar. One bad move and Phoenix Wright can turn the entire game around, kind of like what he does in the cases of his own series, actually.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Rocket Raccoon</a>. Yes, he's a walking raccoon with a gruff British accent, he has middling HP, and his combos are very difficult to pull off, but he has great trapping ability, good keepaway, and is hard to hit due to being the smallest character in the roster.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperDeformed">Super-Deformed</a> cat girl Neko-Arc in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em>. Despite being unplayable (literally) in half of the versions, Neko-Arc is hilariously broken: very small height, good speed, and powerful ranged and throwing attacks. A safe strategy leans towards crouching in a corner continually tripping her until she runs out of health. Luckily, she doesn't do too much damage overall, and has about the worst defense in the game, but if a skilled player hits enough times... Neko-Arc suffers from one problem: her only attack that's likely to land a hit on the opponent is her True Ancestor Beam, which requires magic circuit to use. Neko-Arc Chaos, on the other hand, combines all of Neko-Arc's advantages with some of Nrvnqsr Chaos' far-reaching attacks. <em>*shudder*</em>
<ul><li> Both Neko-Arcs (in modes retaining their unique paper air-dash) can actually stay out of an attacker's reach for a ridiculous period of time. If they gain a life advantage during a match, then get hit in mid air near the peak of their high jumps, they can air-recover (resetting their actions) and air-dash slowly across the screen... TWICE.
</li></ul></li><li> Someone made a version of Mario for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MUGEN">M.U.G.E.N</a></em> called "NES Mario." NES Mario is just like what you think: the version of Mario from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Mario 1</a></em>, and he's tiny at that. He can only attack by jumping on enemies and he dies in two hits (if you don't press the button to turn into Super Mario again at the expense of some of the lifebar, a merciful addition). However, there's something that makes him lethal: Fighting game characters flinch when hit, Mario does not. If you get a window of opportunity, you can just keep on stomping your foe and finish them off in less than a minute. Ironically, he can't survive his own stage, and you have to wait a long time after he dies for the game to progress!
<ul><li> There's also the Metool, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MascotMook">Mascot Mook</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em>. It takes twice the damage from any attack, hence dying twice as fast as a regular character. However, it's tiny and very hard to normally damage, it can juggle opponents with its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreadShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpreadShot">Spread Shot</a>, has access to its signature helmet guard which makes it invulnerable to ANYTHING, an unblockable super where a bunch of metools rush the enemy for a third of their health, and finally, its ultimate attack drops the Metool Daddy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan4">Mega Man 4</a></em> on the enemy for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.

He pretty much plays like he did in his original appearance. He can't dash and has a delayed jump and cannot defend. His only attack is a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollisionDamage">Collision Damage</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>. However, said attack also makes him nearly untouchable. Any kind of physical contact towards Bandana Dee will also hurt the attacker in the process and he/she can get knocked back. Thus, Bandana Dee is a surprisingly tough boss for any character who relies on rushdown attacks. He can be stopped by long-range attacks such as projectiles and also grabs.

Even though he only had a few attacks that don't do much damage, all the <em>other</em> characters' attacks were designed to attack regular characters, meaning a vast majority of them fly over him. It came to the point that all of a character's intricate combos would be useless and they'd have to focus on aiming kunai or carefully timing sweep kicks to hope to survive.

She has three special attacks: of these, two do low damage and are difficult to connect with. The third also does low damage; unlike any other special attack however, it can be used up to four times in a row. Combine with Mel's special ability to triple jump out of range, and suddenly the opposition is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMauling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyMauling">crushed by a never-ending rain of unavoidable moneybags</a> spawned by an untouchable foe.
</li><li> The Chairperson in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RivalSchools">Rival Schools</a></em> is pathetic in battle, as she trained in Saikyo, the martial arts style of Dan Hibiki! Her design is nothing to write home about, either; she's unremarkableâ€”but that's part of her appeal. Her Team-Up Attack is one of the most powerful in the game, as it is the only one which recovers both health <em>and</em> your super meter. She's useless as a player character, but invaluable as a teammate.

She looks like a defenseless schoolgirl, and she's often surprised whenever she wins, but her attacks can be deadly.

She screams out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">Big "NO!"</a> to stop air attacks cold. And best (or worst, depending on your point of view) of all, she has a 12-hit slap move that is dangerous all by itself, but can be easily chained to her scrambling super attack for up to 33 hits, the highest in the game!

Despite the silly-looking nature of the moveset, it's A) incredibly fast, B) two of the tambourine weapons (Mazurka and Terpischore) have the ability to heal the character with every successful hit, and C) many of its most basic moves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">utterly break the A.I.</a> Use the class enough times also unlocks the Soul of Xianghua, meaning access to her infamous "Great Wall" attack.
</li><li> Dan Hibiki. Being such an famous joke, few bother to properly train against him, which is a mistake.
<ul><li> Dan debuted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a></em> as a parody of <em>Street Fighter</em> copycats and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shotoclone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shotoclone">Shotoclones</a>" in general. Dan relied on cheap shots to win, but he was known for being very tricky in the right hands. His normals are some of the hardest-hitting in the game, and his pathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken">Shoryuken</a> (the Koryuken) becomes invincible after a certain amount of attacks or taunts. This is why Dan has more taunt inputs than any other character in the <em>Alpha</em> trilogy. If you're good at keeping count, this can lead to a humiliating defeat for your opponent when you cancel their Super!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroesVsStreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelSuperHeroesVsStreetFighter">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a></em> change his useless Otoko Michi from an amusing way to kill yourself into the most damaging move in the game. It still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HPToOne">reduces Dan to exactly a pixel of health</a> when it hits, but losing Dan to take out one member of the opposing team is a net gain. More hilariously, it has priority over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Dangerous Forbidden Technique</a>, Shun Goku Satsu, which Otoko Michi is a parody of: if Akuma (the strongest Shoto character ever) and Dan both use their respective supers on each other, Dan will emerge triumphant! His Punch and Launch throw is especially nasty, leading to some loops and mind games when used well. He had good pokes, and with the right partners he could actually be very effective.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomSVCChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SNKVsCapcomSVCChaos">SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos</a></em>. Gadoshokoken piffles out after a few feet, but covers the same area as a Haohshokoken, which means that it'll catch you in a jump every time. Stupid, showy power punch (mimicing Ryo's super move which dizzies enemies if it connects) has a hideous recovery time, but does a lot of damage and sends his oppnent flying across the screen, so it can't be punished unless they land directly in a corner. The long windup functions as an autoguard which can block anything, even normally unblockable moves. Same ol' dumb Dankukyaku which is faster than before and can easily punish fireballs. And of course, the Otoko Michi, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">Desperation Attack</a>, takes off half your life and causes him no damage.
</li><li> Dan is also effective in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CapcomVsSNK2MarkOfTheMillennium">Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium</a></em>, albeit due to a bug. If you pick A-groove and activate it, you can infinitely chain his Dankukyaku and juggle his opponent.
</li><li> Dan is at the height of his power in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>, making him middle-tier. His Shisso Buraiken Ultra Combo has priority over Akuma's Shin Shun Goku Satsu Ultra. This is hilarious to see in action: if Akuma's move activates, he cannot escape. Dan's Super is a stupidly-long combo which is easily punishable if you miss, but surpasees his Super if it lands. His Koryuken and Gadouken now deal more damage than their counterparts, all variations of his Dankuukyaku are "safe on block" i.e they can't be punished, his taunts <em>stop oncoming attacks</em>, and his Ultra Combo isn't nerfed like everyone elses'. In <em>Ultra Street Fighter IV</em>, performing a ducking or jumping taunt fills his Super Meter, which is crucial for a character with some of the funniest taunts. Shissho Buraiken has armor-breaker properties, to boot.

(And they're finite, to boot!) But he's actually quite good. He also strives to be everything Dan wasn't. They nerfed his balls off (err...) in <em>3S</em>, though, making Twelve the only character worse than him. It's notable that Sean's actually <em>worse</em> than <em>de facto</em> <em>Street Fighter</em> joke Dan Hibiki in the storyline.

But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom</a></em>, she's significantly improved. She still has a low stamina (with Karas being the lowest), but she is tiny, has a disjointed hitbox thanks to her broom, and has a fast air-dash. Her ground combos can lead to her Roll Sweep-Sweep special move, which can hit a grounded foe and cannot be escaped. She also has a level 1 hyper move <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealThyself">that recovers her health decently</a> too. Adding to this, a hidden detail to her is that if she sweeps up the puddles she can produce with a special move using her mop, she becomes even stronger, nearing some of the strongest characters strength-wise with a maximum of 5 swept-up puddles (or just a single one if she uses the super version of the sweep-up attack).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros">Super Smash Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> At first glance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Jigglypuff</a> is a terrible character: Slow ground speed, short reach, two incredibly punishable specials, is sent flying off the stage if its shield gets broken, and is as light as you'd expect from the "Balloon PokÃ©mon" in a game where launching people off the screen is the name of the game. However, Jigglypuff's real strength comes from its amazing air game: It's incredibly nimble in the air and can jump multiple times, which combined with effective aerial attacks with low-angled launch trajectories means getting back on the stage against a good Jigglypuff is a nightmare for many characters. Adding to that, its special "Rest" is the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a>; although it has an incredibly short range and leaves Jigglypuff completely defenseless for a long time, sleeping somehow sends people rocketing upwards<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2e7w7');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2e7w7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2e7w7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Snake's codec conversation in <em>Brawl</em> states Jigglypuff releases high amounts of kinetic energy upon resting</span> even at relatively low damage. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3y8qv');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3y8qv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3y8qv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Around 25% in <em>Melee</em>, 75% in <em>Brawl</em>, and 50% in <em>3DS/Wii U</em></span> This has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZagged">Zig-Zagged</a>, however, as Jigglypuff is known to vary heavily from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff">Balance Buff</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerf</a>, being all over the place from a legitimate powerhouse (<em>Melee</em>) to an ineffectual gimmick (<em>Brawl</em>, <em>4</em>) to somewhere in between (<em>64</em>, <em>Ultimate</em>).
</li><li> <em>Smash 4</em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AnimalCrossing">Villager</a>, who like Jigglypuff, has all the makings of a truly bad character. Not very fast, poor combo ability, and light weight making them combo fodder for other characters really hides just how deceptively powerful the character is. The Villager's first main calling card is their forward smash, which has good reach, hits very hard even at low percentages, and is very effective for edgeguarding. Villager also has the "Pocket" move, which catches objects and stores them for future use, including <em>virtually every enemy projectile</em> and even makes Villager completely invulnerable to all damage for a few frames. Finally, there's the Villager's trump card: Timber. The Villager grows a huge tree that can either be cut down (which causes incredible damage) or used as an effective shield. Not only that, as long as the tree is on the field, Villager can instead use the Axe as a powerful attack, making the Villager a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">quirky</a> but dangerous character overall, even to the point of gaining the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> "Killager".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosMelee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a></em>, Pichu is truly a pretty bad character - It's extremely light, a large number of its moves do recoil to it, and its attacks don't have much range or do much damage. On top of that, it's a clone of Pikachu, who, while not top tier, does basically everything Pichu can do much better. What else would be expected of a baby PokÃ©mon? <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosUltimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em> is a different story, though. Pichu is still the lightest character the game, still has bad range, and still damages itself, now with even more moves giving recoil. However, the recoil doesn't do as much damage, Pichu's mobility and recovery have improved, and a lot of its attacks are quite powerful. Combine that with the rage mechanic â€” which makes a character stronger the more damage they take â€” and Pichu's biggest weakness is at least partially converted into a strength. It was, on the whole, re-worked from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a>.

But once one masters the art of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">de-synching</a> the Climbers, allowing true control of them both, they become one of the most insanely powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> characters on the roster, with multiple infinite-grabs in both <em>Melee</em> and <em>Brawl.</em> Even when chaingrabbing was removed in <em>Ultimate</em>, they still do excellent damage when de-synched.
</li><li> From the same series as Villager, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreciousPuppy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreciousPuppy">adorable</a> fan-favorite Isabelle from <em>New Leaf</em> became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a> in <em>Ultimate</em> as a semi-clone of her higher-up. While a lot of her traits are the same as Villager's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">Difficult, but Awesome</a> playstyle, she has a few differences in her moveset which set her apart while still making her a literal bitch<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4iy0x');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4iy0x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4iy0x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the correct term for female dogs, by the by</span> to face if you aren't prepared. Her attacks are not especially damaging - her jab, for example, is a <em>squeaky toy hammer</em> which only deals <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeItem">1% damage per hit</a> - but her true calling card is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">versatility</a>, with answers to all kinds of situations. These include, and are not limited to, her dash attack dropping a projectile straight down which can hit opponents trying to reach a ledge from below, her forward smash and up-smash being able to deal surprising burst damage at point-blank range, and the same slingshot aerials and Pocket ability as Villager. Most important, however, is her side-special, Fishing Rod, which allows her to not only snatch items from a considerable distance but also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrappleMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrappleMove">grab opponents</a> before hurling them over the horizon if the lure hits them during either casting or reeling in. On paper it seems like a risky strategy because it forces Isabelle to stay still while the hook is out, so failing to hit opponents with it leaves her a sitting duck, but an experienced player can combine this with the impressive recovery offered by her up-special, Balloon Trip, by following an airborne opponent off the stage before aiming and timing the cast so it can catch and fling them straight into the blast line even at moderate KO percentage. This combination of skills makes her noticeably harder to punish than most would suspect, allowing her to go toe-to-toe with the best of them all with as cheery a smile as ever. (The aforementioned Fishing Rod was also responsible for the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">"infinite Assist Trophy" glitch</a>, wherein two Isabelles used Fishing Rods to catch an Assist Trophy at the same time leading to one Isabelle summoning an endless amount of a single Assist Trophy, but this has been patched out as of Version 2.0.0.).
</li><li> Exclusive to <em>Smash Remix</em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros64">Super Smash Bros. 64</a></em>, is Polygon Kirby. Originally just one of the enemies for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMookMelee">Multi-Mook Melee</a> battles, <em>Remix</em> makes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">Promoted to Playable</a>. None of the Fighting Polygon Team have any special moves, so they have no projectiles and are bad at recovering, and they don't have throws, so they virtually always lose the classic Attack/Block/Throw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalRockPaperScissors">Tactical RockÂ–PaperÂ–Scissors</a> that fighting games are known for. So you'd think Kirby, despite his being one of the two most competitively powerful characters in <em>64</em>, would also have his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff">Evil Knockoff</a> being pathetic with these handicaps, right? Well... Kirby <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">barely ever uses</a> his special moves in tournaments anyway, and most of his recovery is in his multiple jumps â€” which Polygon Kirby retains â€” rather than his up special. In addition, one of <em>64</em> Kirby's most major strengths is his effectiveness at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShieldsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShieldsAreUseless">easily breaking shields with his standard attacks</a>. So, functionally speaking, Polygon Kirby is barely even touched by the polygons' limitations and is almost as strong as ordinary Kirby.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em>Tekken 3</em>, we got the baby T-Rex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gon">Gon</a>... who, despite being a bit slow and short (or due to being short), cannot be attacked by high attacks, cannot be thrown, and has unblockable <em>projectiles</em>.
</li><li> Not to mention Dr. Boskonovitch, who spends most of the time lying on the ground! But he provides quite the challenge as the end boss of an optional mini-game, and can be lethal in the hands of an expert player. Dr. Boskonovitch can turn the tables in an instance with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ISurrenderSuckers">his variety of stances and fakeouts</a> which, for a game like <em>Tekken 3</em>, is quintessential. Hell, he's got an unblockable paralyzing attack, can do a sudden ground-stomping-kaboom after mindlessly evading your attacks, is practically unpredictable, etc. And he's got a killer <strong>20-hit combo</strong>, while the rest of the characters have only 10-hit combos. The downside is that it can be hard to learn how to control him properly.
</li><li> Kuma and his son Kuma II (as well as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> Panda), the latter particularly in <em>6</em>. The Kumas are bears with big hit boxes and crappy range (though less of a problem in <em>Tekken 2</em>), they move slow, and their moves are predictable. On the plus side, in <em>Tekken 2</em> and <em>6</em> they attack at a decent speed. For some reason from <em>Tekken 3</em> they decided to nerf Kuma II <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note51hxb');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note51hxb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note51hxb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">because, in-universe, Kuma I died sometime before the game was released</span> into a crappy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>, then <em>Tekken 6</em> undid a lot of the damage, and gave him a whole bunch of new moves, including the fact he can now juggle! Kuma II still moves slow, he still has crap range, a big hitbox and can be very predictable if not played properly... but he attacks at a decent pace and he still has his high power meaning he can put on a lot very quickly. Yay rebalancing! Not to mention the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fartillery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fartillery">Bear Fart</a>." It's hard to connect, but it's one of the most powerful moves in any <em>Tekken</em> game and practically a OHKO if it connects. To wit, South Korean professional Hyeon-ho "Rangchu" Jeong, a dedicated Panda player for most of his career, took a character widely agreed to be low-tier by the <em>Tekken</em> community to the Tekken World Tour <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken7">in 2018</a>... <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkHPr2OhF_A">and<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHz2vDQ2m8E">won.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>
</li><li> <em>Tekken 6</em> has Roger Jr., the kickboxing kangaroo, and his joey. Like his dad, he's both utterly ridiculous and thought by many to be a top-tier character.
</li><li> <em>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</em> has few of these too. Lili's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">butler</a> Sebastian makes his debut as a playable character, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovesetClone">shares most of his moves</a> with Lili. There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexierAlterEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexierAlterEgo">slimmer, sexier</a> version of Bob. He has the same moves as Bob, but has some trouble doing some of the moves due to his trim figure. Also, previously mentioned Doctor B. reappears as a DLC character. His movelist has been changed, so now he surprisingly spends most of the time <em>standing</em>, but he still has a lot of joke moves. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEG1TkYvDs8">Here is a video about his infamous butt slide attack.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> Kurumi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VanguardPrincess">Vanguard Princess</a></em>. Unlike the super-beings that are the rest of the cast, she is just a schoolgirl with only one move, but is the only character who can chain combo (deadly in this game as combos tend to be low in number and hit at near full power to compensate,) and as of the latest revision her supers are basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a>.
</li><li> Ponygon is a.. thing from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a> Mamodo Battles</em>. He has no spells (and thus no ultimate spell) due to his lack of a partner, which leaves him with only punching with his hooves. However, if you get your opponent up against a wall, he has an <em>infinite</em> that can't be teched out of, both with a conventional tech or a spell counter tech. Attempting either of these will just have him hit you again before you're able to do anything. This also works regardless of body size, so both big and small characters alike are unable to escape once they're hit.

<ul><li> Mechless D.Va from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch">Overwatch</a></em> can be killed easily, since she is only armed with her Light Gun pistol, lost all of her abilities (except to wait so she can summon a new mech), and having the lowest health (tied with Tracer) out of all characters in-game. However, her pistol packs quite a punch, has no damage fall-off, pretty accurate even in mid-range, capable of headshots, and D.Va herself is very agile. If you play her right, one can make a seemingly easy to kill target into a force to be reckoned with, capable of winning 1 vs 1 encounters with other Tank characters in the game.
</li><li> The Monkey of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplitters2">Time Splitters 2</a></em> and its sequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TimeSplittersFuturePerfect">Future Perfect</a></em>. With character attributes off, the monkey still retains its MUCH smaller hitbox, making him VERY hard to hit. Worse yet, his hitbox is BELOW the neutral position viewline, meaning opponents need to deliberately aim downwards to make their shots count, adding to the inaccuracy. With attribs on, his speed combines with the already almost gamebreaking hitbox, making him literally impossible to damage with non-hitscan weapons if played right.
<ul><li> Monkey is only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a> at the select screen. As soon as you face him you realize he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>. There is even a stat that which keeps track of how many times you've played as him and he's overall seen as a cheat character. Modes like Monkey Assistant is a nightmare: The last player gets a team of monkies wielding rocket launchers after them. One should also not forget Robofish, who is probably an even more Lethal Joke Character. First he is really hard to unlock in all the games. Secondly he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">a robot with a fish bowl for its head.</a> After that he's equally fast and short as monkey, but since his body is as thin as it gets, he has a smaller hitbox. Even the head is hard to hit. The Shoal is also worth fitting up here. He's a floating whale with a top hat. The reason he's good is that when you realize he lacks legs he's harder to hit. He's got a fairly large torso, but the head is not part of the whale, but a fish on top. It's pretty small and unassuming and not very different from all the other fishes floating around him, thus it's very rarely anybody ever does a headshot on him.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloII">Diablo II</a></em>s expansion Lord of Destruction features the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalKiller">Assassin</a> which has a skill called Blade Fury which is weak in comparism to other traps the Assassin can set and receives barely a better base damage to mana cost ratio if you spend more skill points into it. The catch of this skill is that it gets stronger the stronger you get yourself as it inflicts 75% weapon damage to enemies. This becomes even more impressive when you realize that it also causes the traits of your weapons like elemental damage as well as the traits you add to it by other means like armor or skills. So if your weapon possesses Mana Steal you have a ranged attack that refills your mana as long as it hits, if your weapon possesses Knockback it will push enemies away from you and if your weapon possesses the ability to randomly cast spells it will cast that spell with a similar ratio where it hits and it costs almost no mana at all. The downsides of it are that you can't move while you use it (you can't move while you cast most spells anyway), it only hits single enemies as long as it doesn't cast other spells and enemies are still able to avoid or block it (though as evasions and blocks are often tied to an animation they might be hit by the next blade as soon as they recover from defending). This is an example of a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> for bosses outside of the screen caused by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">spam attack</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiabloIII">Diablo III</a></em> has the Angry Chicken Hex for Witch Doctors which turns them into a chicken that explodes two seconds later. While silly, an end game build exists for high-speed clears of rifts using this as a centerpiece.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DynastyWarriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> 5</em>, one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">(MANY)</a> characters is Zuo Ci, an old man whose weapon is a deck of cards. At first glance, especially compared to massive pike-wielding badasses, this seems exceptionally lame. And yet his attacks, while not especially powerful, tend to hit EVERYONE even remotely close to him. In a game where it's quite common to be surrounded by 30-40 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a>, this is invaluable.
<ul><li> The Qiao sisters and their twin fans are rather weak, in damage dealing terms. Still, if they're played correctly, they can defeat dificult enemies in levels where the rest of characters would have to run for their lives.
</li><li> Further mention goes to Xiao Qiao, whose ultimate weapon in <em>DW3</em> had the instant death element imbued onto her final charge attack string. Use it on an enemy officer and watch his/her life bar deplete instantly.
</li><li> Also, in the online version, Zuo Ci's weapon seems to be the weakest out of all of them, inversely having one of the WORST stat averages of the game, the average high of the weapon is actually poor quality if compared to other weapons, and having a mostly gimmicky moveset. Unless you get the right combination of first and 6th charge attack. If done right, you can have a perfect assist weapon, second only to none. You could have the ability to naturally stun, freeze, or burn any opponent without using items, and if you do then you can stack up the advantage by using a combination of 2-3 elements depending on your luck with the weapon attacks. Being able to inflict status effects stacks well with the activation skill, you get a debuff and slowly lose health, one of the weapon's higher stats, and give a bonus in attack and defense to all friends, as well as heal them. You don't play this weapon for it's stats.
<ul><li> It also helps that C2 can effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">stunlock an AI enemy.</a> Possibly while said enemy is on fire.
</li><li> With the recent buff to the deck, it's gotten even more lethal. Instead of shooting three energy shots, the deck now shoots fire, just like Zuo Ci's. Combined with the deck's musou attack, you've easily got a slightly less powerful true musou.
</li><li> Talking about online, a less straight out joke weapon is the Feather fan, not to be confused with the strategist's fan of the same game that is also a feather fan but uses black feathers, because you can ask anybody online about Zhuge Liang, the character that this weapon moveset is based off of, and they will tell you it sucks. However, those who do know how to use it are in for a treat. It has very high defense, life, and attack upgrades, comparable the weapon based off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a> from the original ''DW'' games, and a deadly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Musou attack</a> is hard to aim, being a spamming of beams forward, but if you manage to connect you get a very effective stunlock that is impossible to get out of once hit unless the attacker stop or misses. Along with that it has only one really good normal attack, a moving wall attack, and it makes it confusing if somebody starts using other parts of the combo, you aren't likely to see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpinAttack">Charge 4</a> in combat, making it confusing when it's suddenly used to knock you and anybody near you away after you trap a user.
</li><li> The Tonfas are viewed as pathetic weapons due to their range, strange stat locations, and somewhat less than stellar emblems. Its charge 5, however, can naturally set things on fire, a very valuable attack to have. Ironically, it also has a large range and is very easy to hit someone from behind, effectively making guarding useless. Combined with a lightning orb, and you'll have an essentially undodgable attack.

<ul><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> gives us the Gouf, a slow, somewhat plodding fighter with a short sword and a weak machine gun...that has armor for days and uses its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipItGood">Heat Rod</a> to stun and beat down entire crowds of mobile suits.
</li><li> The Acguy from the same series is a goofy, fan-favorite mobile suit that is weak, but combines a surprisingly fast speed with a charge attack that sends it rolling across the ground and bowling over entire squads of enemy suits; it may not kill them quickly, but enemies will be hard pressed to keep up with the little bowling ball.
</li><li> The king of this trope, however, is Beargguy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ModelSuitGunplaBuildersBeginningG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ModelSuitGunplaBuildersBeginningG">Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G</a></em>. A rather silly-looking Acguy variant designed to resemble a teddy bear, Beargguy isn't any better than the Acguy it's made from at first glance thanks to low stats and weak physical attacks. That is, until it starts using its special attacks, at which point it reveals itself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a>-spewing, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">Beam Spamming</a> monstrosity. It retains the Acguy's rolling charge attack, but now it fires waves of homing missiles with every tumble. Rather than the puny machine guns the Acguy is forced to use, it has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">laser eyes</a>. Finally, instead of the simple claw attack that the Acguy has for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, Beargguy fires sprays of energy blasts from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableWeaponUser">a beam recorder</a> (read as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstrumentOfMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstrumentOfMurder">the wind instrument</a>). This means that the Beargguy can launch a flurry of missiles, use the damage caused by them to charge its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, then use <em>that</em> to knock down enemies so it can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfHurting">start its missile attack again</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RagnarokOnline">Ragnarok Online</a></em>:
<ul><li> A class called the Super Novice can be obtained if one creates a regular Novice and keeps it from obtaining a class until base lv 45. The Super Novice at first seems to have a great deal of potential, being allowed to acquire almost all the skills the 1st class Jobs can use, and having a collective pool of 99 points (instead of the usual 50 1st class Jobs usually have) to allocate them to. However, Super Novices can only use the same crappy gear novices have, and along with their abysmally low HP/SP gains from leveling up, can easily be killed in one or two hits. Their real strength shines if built like a Mage class, as, since casting time for spells is determined by the game's DEX stat, using the right gear, maxing their base DEX stat, and using all the DEX skill buffs available to them, the Super Novice can nearly be able to instantly cast spells. If coupled with a Bard skill that even further lowers casting time and after-cast delay, players can effectively make efficiently-leveled Super Novices into living, Fire Bolt-spewing maching guns...as long as their puny SP holds out, anyway. Or if built for maxing their AGI stat, they get the highest Flee sub-stat in the game and if their XP is kept between 99 and 100% they will get up if killed with a host of buffs making them a strange little tank so long as they're not being mobbed.
</li><li> Another class that can become a Lethal Joke Character is Soul Linker. If you choose to go support route for its skill tree, then you practically have no way to damage monsters. That is, until people realized Soul Linker can equip anything that Mage class can equip, including the Lethal Joke <strong>Weapon</strong>, Counter Dagger. Counter Dagger is a dagger that massively boost Critical rate<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note60ppj');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note60ppj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note60ppj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">high Critical rate makes most of your physical attack does Critical damage, which not only always use your current maximum ATK stat for its calculation, but also multiplies the damage by 1.4x, as well as ignoring the opponent's Flee sub-stat</span>, however, the dagger is only equip-able by Mage class, making it useless as Mages are better off using their powerful magic instead of physical attacks, and magic can't even deal Critical damage to begin with. But a build focused on this particular weapon can be very deadly in the hand of a Soul Linker, especially since Soul Linkers' "Ka-" support skills are able to make them last longer in battles compared to Mage class characters. Physical attacks, including Critical ones, are also affected by "Mild Wind", a support skill from Taekwon Kid class, the class Soul Linker originates from. "Mild Wind" combined with Counter Dagger allows Soul Linkers to have strong physical Ghost, Shadow, and Holy element attacks, something that's a rarity in the game, not to mention they're also Critical attacks. With some buffs and the right stats build, a Soul Linker can deal an upwards of 1500-2000 constant Critical damage under 185-187 Attack Speed (note that the maximum Aspd is 190, meaning 185 is already very fast!), making it a very strong build when used right.

He has no offensive capabilities to speak of. However, if he manages to place and arm a stun mine in the middle of a teamfight, it inflicts an insane 6 second area effect stun that pretty much equals gg. Also, a stacked mine nest is an instant kill, so you have to walk around with a gem of truesight at all times or risk instantly dying to nothing exploding on top of you.

But his ultimate is what makes him so unique. It passively creates a permanent replica of Meepo for each level + one more if he buys Aghanim's Scepter. Each Meepo clone can attack, use abilities, boots, and some bonus stats, meaning that at level six he turns from one terrible hero to two terrible heroes, and then to three and four and then finally five terrible heroes all bashing you in the face at once.
</li><li> Rubick, despite being a Grand Magus, has <em>crappy</em> stat growth (his Int growth is in fact tied with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Ogre Magi</a>, and his other stats aren't any better). His spells, while not useless, pale in comparison to other heroes' (his stun deals no damage and has a hideously long cooldown, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainLightning">Chain Lightning</a> damage is really mediocre for its cost), and the way his ultimate works means most of the time he <em>doesn't have</em> an ultimate.

At first glance he looks atrocious - his abilities are weird and jokey and he has health and AA damage similar to a lane minion. Even the game describes him as "not quite a full hero". However, he can be an absolute nightmare in the right hands. For starters, he's <em>built</em> to die a lot, and is barely punished when it happens<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note06y4b');"><sup>*Â </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note06y4b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note06y4b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As long as his egg is alive, he'll respawn from it in eight seconds, <em>not</em> scaling with the normal death timer. Also, he's only worth 1/4 of a kill.</span> Murky is a beast at clearing lanes and taking merc camps, which he can do at no cost thanks to his lack of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">resource</a> and insane health regen. His third ability, Safety Bubble, extends his tiny health pool far, resisting <em>everything</em> for a short period and letting him fearlessly bridge the gap and apply Slime. His sustained damage is among the highest in the game - again, at no resource cost, and if Pufferfish lands it <em>hurts</em>. Finally, his heroics are among the best in the game, either summoning a massive area-denying swarm of murlocs, or channeling to stun an enemy for three seconds on a relatively short cooldown.
</li><li> Teemo in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> is a cuddly bipedal hamster (he's actually a Yordle) wearing a scout hat and wielding a blowpipe.

However, he has the same 'mind games' specialty as Dan Hibiki above- at the level where you're skilled enough to exploit his weaknesses, he's so rarely played that no one is actually <em>prepared</em> to counter him. It doesn't hurt that his kit is practically designed to let him run rings around those who underestimate him and pester his opponents into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RageQuit">Rage Quit</a>. Leaving Teemo be will result in the entire battlefield being mined with his infamous mushrooms, making it dangerous for the enemy team to go into their own jungle. Losing it in frustration (it being seriously embarrassing to play as a badass barbarian leader, warrior prince, or whatever and get your butt owned by a cute Yordle who might be on the other side of the field and letting his mushroom traps do all the work) and chasing him is also a terrible idea- while Teemo is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> who will probably die to you if you catch him, it's probably a set up with Teemo and his team taking advantage of his legendary Global Taunt to lure you into a trap and/or a massive ambush.

At least, not directly. By combining her charge attack with her barrier, she can create a bigger, more damaging attack, the downside being that if she uses it in the air, the recoil thrusts her back. It turns out that Milla can use this move facing <em>away</em> from the direction she should go for an instant burst of momentum via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoilBoost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoilBoost">Recoil Boost</a> that, when used repeatedly and in the hands of an expert, allows her to run as fast as the game can handle <em>and</em> maintain that speed while flying, skipping portions of every stage and setting speed records.

It's slow, it has no attacks whatsoever, it can't jump in a platform game, and it tips over easily. Its only advantage is being indestructible. Which is why you pick up the Super Gonk extra, which boosts its speed considerably and lets it jump, and Self Destruct, which lets it blow itself up, turning it into an unstoppable and remarkably fast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionBomb">Action Bomb</a> that wipes out pretty much anything.

As his Oil Surfboard does boatloads of damage, knocks off enemy shields, gives him a double-jump worthy of the gods, incredible speed, the ability to glide across water and a near-complete negation to enemy knockback. Same goes for Mega, which is essentially Mega Man if he never became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Super Fighting Robot</a>. All he has is a dinky little kick, which doesn't even have the length of Roll's broom. Useless, right? Well, no. It's actually one of the most powerful attacks in the game, can break most enemy shields and even causes Wily's first form to temporarily be stunned.

Finally, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Time Bomb</a> charge attack is incredibly useful since you can even switch forms and the effects will continue.
</li><li> Team Rose from the fighting mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicHeroes">Sonic Heroes</a></em>. They're rated as the worst team, and in the actual game they're all much slower than their counterparts and less efficient overall, but are very hard to deal with in the fighting mode so much so that the Team Chaotix boss fight with them is actually one of the game's more difficult bosses. This is because Big (power character), by far the tallest of the characters, gives them a huge height advantage over the other teams while in flight formation, making them very hard to reach and able to hit you with long ranged attacks while you struggle to hit their flight character at all. Cream's solo attack is also a guaranteed hit unlike the other fly characters' and can be a huge pain to deal with. Amy's spinning hammer attack is the only speed character move that can break through or match a power character's attacks, and unlike other speed characters she can launch a tornado attack from a distance. It is actually entirely possible, with quick enough reactions, to jump, throw a tornado, and hit the entire team of your opponent, sending them spiraling off the edge in literal seconds. Big also tends to overpower the other power characters when they're directly engaging, blowing them much further back than they blow him. In standard gameplay, Team Rose is also basically the game's easy mode, having the shortest levels and the fewest obstacles.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsteroidThicket">Arod</a> is a very low-gravity civilization, which means blocks fall slowly, and cleared blocks leave the playfield slowly. In addition, garbage blocks sent by the opponent seem to pack a lot of momentum on Arod, plowing through other blocks in its way. Its Planet Impact, Gambit, decreases the density of falling blocks on Arod while increasing it for the opponent. Arod's slowness renders it unable to keep up with any other planet in the game. However, it doesn't need to: Since things move so slowly on Arod, this civilization can stall and resist annihilation relatively easily, forcing attrition on the opponent.

These weak ignitions normally mean it's very difficult to clear blocks on Hanihula, but a player who can find blocks to match quickly enough can keep stringing ignition after ignition before the clusters leave the top of the screen. As there is a score multiplier on consecutive ignitions, Hanihula's ridiculously complex ignitions allow it to outscore most other opponents, provided Hanihula can last long enough for time to run out.

However, in the hands of a skilled player, it's possible to build up a huge combo which buries the enemy in gems, at which point Dan taunts them to death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SushiStrikerTheWayOfSushido" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SushiStrikerTheWayOfSushido">Sushi Striker: The Way of Sushido</a></em> has the weasel-like Sushi Sprite named Uszo, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Com Mons</a> you find at the beginning of the game, wielded by the first opponents. Uszo's ability, Super Scout, allows the display at the bottom-right to show only the opponent until it wears off. By itself, Super Scout has zero impact on the gameplay. However, it combines incredibly well with the Raw Power (passive ability) of Hist-9, which increases attack power by 15% as long as a timed ability is active. Most of the other Sushi Sprites' abilities last between 3 and 8 seconds, making Hist-9 itself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalJokeItem">mostly useless</a>, but not only does Super Scout last a full 30, Uszo charges up fairly quickly and has a menu full of high-ranked sushi (meaning they deal more damage). Play well, and you can keep Super Scout active most of the time, giving yourself an attack bonus that trumps most other Sushi Sprites' abilities due to its generous time limit. Mouzo, found later in the game, has the similarly useless-at-first glance Super Star, which causes the display to show only the <em>user</em> for the next 20 seconds. Though its duration is shorter than Super Scout, Mouzo is still the second best pairing with Hist-9 in the game, and she both has an equally high quality sushi menu as Uszo and provides a rather large defense boost when on your team. One viable competitive scheme is Hist-9 with Uszo, Mouzo, and an empty third slot. They are apparently such a good pairing that putting anyone into the third slot <em>actually makes the team worse</em>.

<ul><li> One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadRising2">Dead Rising 2</a></em>'s many survivors to be rescued is a guy with two broken legs. He can hobble around extremely slowly, or be pushed in a wheelchair. However, if you are holding the magazine that makes survivors slightly more powerful, he can zoom around the map at comically high speeds, and is the most powerful survivor in the game.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilOutbreak">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a></em> games, one of the weaker survivors is Jim Chapman, a slightly cowardly skinny dude who works in the city's subway system. His big move is that he can play dead, which makes monsters ignore him most of the time. However, he also comes equipped with his Lucky Coin, using which makes Jim stand still and flip it in the air. If it comes down heads up, Jim gets a permanent +15% boost to his critical hit rate that can stack up to three times. Since crits in <em>Outbreak</em> knock monsters flying and inflict massive damage, this turns Jim into a pipe-swinging engine of destruction, capable of bludgeoning his way through zombies like it's nothing.
<ul><li> Unlockable NPC characters in the Outbreak series occasionally fall under this trope. While they're essentially reskins of the main 8 characters, each of them have various stats altered. Notable are the "Mr./Mrs. Colors" skins, which are essentially colored stick figures with faces on them. Some of these have better stats than the default characters. Mr. Green, the stick figure equivalent of Jim, is one of the best Jim skins in the game.

Even with great acceleration and grip, the White Wonder is pitifully slow and has an awful special attack. (He just jumps in the air.) Using his special attack many times in a row on a straight stretch will vault a player to the head of the pack... FAST! Slap a few engine upgrades on Vinnie and he will be on par with everyone else, and still have the best acceleration and grip in the game! Every other player ALWAYS has a "WTF?!" reaction when seeing what Vinnie is truly capable of. On top of this, while other characters can body-check opponents by power-sliding on turns, Vinnie does a full spin which can knock someone back around the corner entirely.
</li><li> The Toy cars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise">Burnout Paradise</a></em>. They're miniaturized Power Wheels-style versions of some of the regular cars. They're quite a bit slower than their normal-sized counterparts, but they are much easier to weave through traffic and extremely durable (some of the tougher ones can ram a bus head-on and not wreck.) Their maneuverability and light weight makes them great for Stunt Runs as well; the Toy P12 88 Special in particular gets an obscene amount of hang time.
</li><li> The Flatmobile of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FlatOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FlatOut">FlatOut</a> 2</em> is so comically fast that any typical player simply cannot control it. However, said acceleration is equally reciprocated in its brakes, and at sane speeds it can out-handle any vehicle in the game. In the hands of a truly skilled gamer, no other vehicle can possibly compete, even in the infamous destruction derbies.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ForzaMotorsport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/ForzaMotorsport">Forza Motorsport</a></em> series often includes vehicles which have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">absolutely no reason to be in a racing game</a> such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">Toyota Prius and Nissan Leaf</a>. However, many of the joke characters can become stupid fast with a good tune; the AMC Gremlin, for example, has awful base stats (wallowy suspension, very long gear ratio, terrible 1970s tires), but a few simple upgrades can turn it into a monster, as it's one of the very few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers">F-class</a> cars that mounts a V8 engine, giving the hatchback enough torque to out-accelerate cars a tier above it and laugh at hills that cripple the momentum of cars with the usual I4 engine.
<ul><li> <em>Forza 7</em> has the BMW Isetta microcar, which is extremely unlikely to be raced in real life, but when homologated in-game, even for E class, has the fastest acceleration in the Major Micros division.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotWheelsVelocityX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HotWheelsVelocityX">Hot Wheels Velocity X</a></em>'s Surfin' School Bus. Its 100 armor stat and bulky size make it extremely slow and unviable for joyrides, missions, and challenges...but it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> in Battle and can win (or come close to winning) drag races in the right hands.
</li><li> The Bulk Star in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAirRide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbyAirRide">Kirby Air Ride</a></em>, but only on the Nebula Belt track. The Bulk Star requires charge meter to move, and only moves when it has it or is in the air, which normally makes it terrible because of how often you'd need to stop and charge, all for the ability to go only slightly faster than other rides when you're at higher speeds. The thing about Nebula Belt is that it has a number of ramps that the Star can go off of, and <em>it doesn't lose charge while still accelerating in the air</em>. This allows it to pass 100MPH (far above what other Rides can give) before it runs out of meter, as there's no cap to its speed. Due to the ramps, the only thing that can match it is the Wheelie Scooter, and only through exploits.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeed">Need for Speed</a>: Underground 2</em> Toyota AE86. This car looks hilariously outdated, being a box-shaped mid-'80s car in a game about flashy modern ricers, and it is one of the starter cars alongside the unimpressive Peugeot 206 and Ford Focus. Oh, and it is also <em>by far</em> the best car in the game, beating Skylines and Supras left and right thanks to its very accurate handling. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD">Still laughing?</a>
<ul><li> This car is often amazingly good also in other <em>NFS</em> games. In <em>Carbon</em>, it is considered a BONUS alongide concept cars, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLtimsED6lA">and its handling makes the skilled player even able to stay behind a MurciÃ©lago in canyon races<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In <em>ProStreet</em> this car is able to beat even the Drift King (and it is a tier one, the weakest of the game), and if fully tuned with Stage 4 parts (very much time consuming since they can be only won) can win in each game mode except the most difficult drag races. In <em>Need for Speed 2015</em>, it can conquer whatever drift race you just couldn't win no matter what on a different car.
<ul><li> In Real World drift races, it is still a popular car â€” so much, that an AE86 in good condition can cost no less than $10,000 US dollars, which is an exorbitant price for an almost 40 year old car, and it actually ended up having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> in the recent Toyota GT86 (the name is a portmanteau of the GT2000 and the AE86).
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, when tuned to the max with Junkman parts, the starter cars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedMostWanted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeedForSpeedMostWanted">Most Wanted</a></em> 2005 are among the best cars in the game. Try owning multiplayer races with a <em>Fiat Punto</em>. Ah, the humiliation.
</li><li> Or tuning a Volkswagen Golf to be faster than a Bugatti Veyron.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RidgeRacer">Ridge Racer</a> 4</em> has the Age Solo Ecureuil, a mini car that has one gear but can go from 0 to 180 in three seconds. And you have to race against it in the Extra Trial to unlock it. The car would then appear twice with an extra gear in Ridge Racer(s) 2 for the PSP: once as the Angelus Kid and again as the Crinale Kid.
<ul><li> In <em>Ridge Racer V</em> we would meet with the Soldat Rumeur, a car that looks like the Volkswagen Beetle and can't drift, but can successfully round almost any corner at full speed. The only other car that can do this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Kamata Angelus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultButAwesome">albeit the Angelus takes much more practice to use properly.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Despite his low overall stats, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek">Donkey</a> is generally considered the best playable character in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamworksSuperStarKartz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamworksSuperStarKartz">Dreamworks Super Star Kartz</a></em>. Why? Because his sole maxed-out stat is trick boost speed, Donkey can get so much speed off a single air trick that he can <em>rocket</em> through courses in record time regardless of how low his other stats are, and due to the abundance of boost ramps on most courses, Donkey has no problem chaining those boosts together to the point where he can easily go entire races without losing his speed for more than a second. As a result, Donkey completely dominates online leaderboards to the point where every single time trial record uses him.
</li><li> Amy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicR">Sonic R</a></em>. Only one other character has a top speed worse than her. However, her advantage is having good acceleration and no speed penalty with rain weather effects turned on because she automatically hovers over water. Also, her special move temporarily makes her faster than Super Sonic - the best character in the game - but at the cost of control.
</li><li> If you ever play the PvP racing game in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdventure2">Sonic Adventure 2: Battle</a></em>, see Amy. She's easily the slowest of the available characters, however, she only needs to collect half as many rings to earn a special attack as Sonic or Shadow. In many levels Amy can spam special moves so quickly that her opponent may not even be able to move for minutes at a time. What's more, while Sonic and Shadow's time-freezing ability stops the opponent completely, Amy's only locks the player out of his controls; if they happen to be in the middle of some death-defying stunt (as they often are, given the nature of the game), they'll likely careen off into a pit, be sent back to the last checkpoint, and still have to wait out the remainder of the freeze. Meanwhile, Amy's collected enough rings to attack again... Also, Amy has an unusually fast grinding speed.
<ul><li> In the hands of a skilled player, Metal Sonic is even worse. He's faster than the other characters, but has <em>no special moves</em>, instead getting a spinning shield move...which makes him invincible to absolutely everything, <em>including special attacks,</em> while it's active. A skilled Metal Sonic player will take the lead at the start of the race and just keep widening the gap all the way to the end, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">no-selling</a> all his opponent's attempts to catch up.
<ul><li> Metal Sonic's Black Shield by itself can crack the game open in the right hands. While holding down the B button, Metal Sonic will keep the shield up at the price of not being able to control himself....But he maintains his velocity AND can only GAIN velocity INDEFINITELY! What this means is that in the right stage, with the right timing, Metal Sonic can take any vertical decline given to him and turn it into a perpetual motion generator! Combine this with the game's already touchy relationship with gravitational pulls and the fact that dash-pads tend to be arranged in order to easily redirect people in addition to giving them a boost and Metal Sonic will oftentimes not just pass by his opponent, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooFastToStop">fly past like a bat out of hell while falling sideways and grinding against the upper boundaries of the stage.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Cream the Rabbit from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRiders">Sonic Riders</a></em> has the lowest top speed in the game, and plenty of characters have better handling and acceleration than her. Her 'starting a race' voice clip has her telling other people to go easy on her (and not sarcastically). However, she is the lightest character, meaning her boosts last the longest in a game where you can do boosts at will (provided your gauge hasn't emptied out). Put her on the Light Board, which decreases a character's weight, and she can replenish her boost gauge faster than her boosts run out. An experienced Cream player, once they start boosting, will never stop boosting. She has to go easy on her competitors. (She got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerf</a> in later Sonic Riders gamesâ€”it seems her lethality was not entirely intentional.)
<ul><li> The Light Board in general in the first game is this. It doesn't just make boosts last longer, it adjusts your character's cruising speed to the speed of said boost with the speed raising up to match higher boosting speeds when you level up! The handling becomes extra touchy and there's lots of things you can do to negate the bonus if you're not careful with your maneuvering, but if you can handle the absurd speed that the boost gives, you can go through an entire race at 250 on a singular boost!
</li></ul></li><li> Over the course of its run, arcade game series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WanganMidnight">Wangan Midnight</a> Maximum Tune</em> gives us two which are particularly Lethal Joke Characters: the absolutely diminutive Subaru R2 and the hulking Toyota HiAce. To clarify, the former is a dinky Kei Car and the latter is a huge minivan in a game series which is about tuners getting outputs of 600 horsepower and way up. The R2 is low-power but very lightweight, making it one of the most agile and surefooted cars in the game and the HiAce is a huge brick of automobile that needs to hit trucks to take the hint that it might want to get out of its lane.
<ul><li> The Toyota Celsior and Aristo (Lexus LS and GS, respectively) are cars that, while high-powered, are more designed for luxury than performance. As such their racing ability is questionable, and their in-game performance reflects it...unless you play VS mode. As the heaviest cars in the game, they are the hardest to push around, making it easy to knock away higher-tier cars into traffic or even walls. They also have only 4 gears instead of the standard 5 or 6, making them easier to shift especially in VS mode where the constant slamming of cars into things leads to frequently-fluctuating gears for other vehicles.

Staggeringly weak attacks, low health, and generally regarded as a mere stepping stone to the more effective Musketeers, Halbardiers, and Russian cavalry, but given that Strelets cost 47 resources (compared to 100 for most infantry) and train nearly twice as fast, if you get a couple of the right upgrade cards you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">drown your opponent with Strelets in Age 3</a>.

While using Argilla as the healer, despite the fact her stats make her the best <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage">Black Mage</a>. Late second playthrough, this becomes a fatal mistake.
<ul><li> While other characters can't do anything about their weaknesses until the lategame, and even then they can only resist those elements by taking up a skill slot, Cielo in the hands of a player who sees his potential can begin to null individual ailments as soon as he's introduced, equipping whatever nulls are best for the boss or dungeon. Nulling an enemy's attack causes them to lose a turn. In addition to that, Cielo's seemingly odd and useless stat distribution means that he's got an incredibly high dodge rate &amp; good MP. Dodging an enemy's attack also causes them to lose a turn. It's very common to lose one or more characters to attacks that Cielo dodges without a scratch. Eating the enemy's turn icons make Cielo a defense character, and in addition to that his odds of survival mean that he's able to heal and revive the party after a devastating blow, in addition to the fact that learning to null aliments also means Cielo can block and cure those ailments. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMedicFirst">Shoot the Medic First</a> is impossible when the enemy can't <em>hit</em> the medic.
</li><li> Like the skill Null Sleep, Cielo is also designed for the second playthough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, one of the hardest in JRPG history. Cielo's increased risk of getting hit by ailments plus invulnerability while asleep makes him the most likely to survive the otherwise unavoidable Gaea Rage, on top of the benefits of having no elemental weaknesses &amp; dodging physical attacks.
</li><li> Since so many players failed to see Cielo's potential in the first game, Atlus responded by making him an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> in the second. They tweaked his weakness from "all ailments" to three specific ailments, lowered his odds of being affected by those ailments and increased his dodge rate. Most importantly, they allowed you to use him earlier in the game; a major source of frustration in the first game is that you only get Cielo <em>after</em> "damage plus ailment" attacks become increasingly common.

Gadabout in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em> is the distant ancestor of Magikarp. The male is a circus clown and the female is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny">Playboy Bunny</a>. They have weak equipment, can't cast magic, and tend to shirk their responsibilities in battle; sometimes they do nothing. Sometimes they cause an enemy to lose a turn from laughing. Very rarely, they score a critical hit. The remakes give them Whistle which instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterBait">triggers a random encounter</a>. The random odd things they do without your consent are definitely annoying, but the early game is too easy for it to matter. If they can reach level 20, they will become a Sage, the best class in the game. Every other class needs a specific item in their inventory in order to become one. You can get your hands on two of those items in every version which <em>isn't</em> the NES version. That version only has one. So a Gadabout offers a way to have multiple Sages in your party.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIV">Dragon Quest IV</a></em>, the Gadabout has a "Lucky Dip" skill. It varies character-by-character, not just gender to gender. Try it with a large assortment of different characters and you get some remarkably weird things:

These classes don't excel in anything but "Style" points. They are required for promotion to Luminary or Druid later on. Luminary is worth it for Hustle: think of it like a multi-target heal spell which doesn't cost you any MP. Druid is a great utility character who gets Summon, which conjures another target for mobs/bosses can attack.

He is identical in appearance to other Mudcrabs, he's hidden on a specific island in the Azura's Coast region, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">is difficult to find</a>, he speaks with a drunken dialect... and he has more available gold for bartering than any other merchant in the game outside of the expansions. Even better, he's classed as a "creature," meaning he doesn't have a Disposition or Mercantile skill. Therefore, any items you sell him will be sold at their base price, making it extremely profitable to sell him your loot. If he's too far out in the wilderness for your liking, you can also escort him somewhere more convenient using a "Command Creature" spell. This is also true for Creeper, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Scamp</a> merchant. He has less gold to barter with (5000 vs. the Mudcrab's 10,000) but is in a much more convenient location (the Orc mansion in Caldera, which is one of the Mage's Guild <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarpWhistle">Guild Guide</a> destinations.)

</li><li> The humble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">NCR troopers</a>. Despite being constantly noted as undertrained, poorly motivated, and composed in large part of conscripts, and being the victims of some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> deaths in scripted sequences... and are by far the most dangerous low-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mook</a> characters in the game. The reasons for this are thoroughly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a>: they're still the <em>only</em> faction foot soldiers who are all universally equipped with semi-automatic rifles, grenades, and body armor. As a result, they tend to curb-stomp the foot soldiers of other factions whenever they fight in-game, from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXy6ETWDd7A&amp;t=17m10s">Kings<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <a class="urllink" href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Boulder_City_Showdown#Option:_Free_hostages_via_negotiation">Khans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and can even overpower the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> of the Legion <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YICoWzdSB_Q&amp;t=1s">pretty easily<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This is because 90% of the foot soldiers of the factions mentioned carry either pistols/submachine guns, which are inaccurate and can't penetrate NCR trooper armor and thus will deal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a>, or bolt-action/lever-action rifles, which <em>can</em> but fire so slowly that NCR troopers end up handily outperforming their DPS. It's to the point that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJSzEcsgP6Q">a dozen of them<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> can easily kill the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a> (his armor is proof against their rifles, but the little bits of damage add up and the volume of fire means they eventually get in a lot of lucky shots).
</li><li> In the older games, the Jinxed trait (vastly increases chance of critical failures for all characters) was more or less a joke on a normal build - sure, your enemy's weapons jammed more often than they fired, but so did yours. However, if you played an unarmed-focused character, the downsides for a critical failure were a lot less grievous (hard to drop or break your weapons and ammo if you aren't holding any), and if you maxed your Luck, this meant the chances of missing in the first place was pretty low. You could then waltz through the game karate-kicking people in the face, while every enemy drops their guns or shoots themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> has the Mime class. This is an obscure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobsystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jobsystem">job</a> which is usually hidden near the end of a given game, just because it's so broken. For instance, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>'s resident Mime, Gogo, has fewer equipment choices than most characters and mediocre stats in every category. Their strength lies in their blank slate menu: They can cherry-pick from preexisting skillsets and equip them at any time, up to a total of three. They can also mimic the last action taken by your other characters, but without spending any resources like MP, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlechetteStorm">shurikens</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromMoney">or GP.</a> You can also double-cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic">Last Disc Magic</a> like Ultima in this way. Gogo can pull off otherwise-impossible combinations like Blitz (one of the strongest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarefistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarefistedMonk">Monk abilities</a>) and Mighty Guard (a Blue Mage spell which is the best party-wide buff).
</li><li> If you're confused about why you went through so much effort to unlock the seemingly useless Onion Knight in the DS remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em>, then you obviously don't know that the Onion Knight's stat growth explodes at levels 90-99. In addition, they have access to all types and levels of magic from level 1, so they can be used to cast non-stat based spells (such as status cures) at lower levels than usual.
</li><li> The "Spoony Bard" himself, Edward from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>. People absolutely hated him in the original version.
<ul><li> His harps are generally useful and can inflict status ailments for no MP cost. The real trick is to equip a Lamia's Harp to Charm enemies or a Dream Harp to put them to Sleep while the rest of your party concentrates their fire on other targets. Salve (which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyByRegion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DifficultyByRegion">was removed from the US/AUS version</a>) allows him to combine single-target Potions and heal the whole party at once. Also, if you've got two or three characters knocked out, using Salve on Phoenix Down revives them all at once.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">GBA</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStationPortable">PSP</a> versions, he learns new Songs naturally; and his Regenerative song, Life's Anthem, will easily handle healing duties during any boss battle. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeons</a> are the best thing to happen to Edward, thanks to new equipment. An upgrade to Bardsong (Chant) casts full-party Protect and Shell. Due to the game's poorly thought-out stat gains, you will see Edward gain a <em>lot</em> of health at Lv. 70, plus he has <em>the highest base strength in the game</em> at that level. He is so fast, it looks like he has auto-Haste, and Apollo's Harp hits most dragons and undead enemies in the final dungeon for 9,999 damage if he's in the front row. Guess he is just a late bloomer.
</li><li> The party can also use the "Psycho Edward Bug" to turn the prissy bard into an invincible, semi-automatic machine gun. If he takes too many hits, he "Hides" off-screen. Casting Berserk on Edward and then dropping his HP to critical will cause him to attack like a normal Berserked character, with increased attack power. But he'll still be considered in "Hiding", so <em>nothing</em> can target him, unless everyone else is dead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>:
<ul><li> Fans who were burned by the Bard in previous games will be hesitant to use them here. Their stats are terrible, with poor equipment selection, and devastating penalties to strength and HP. Still, they're better in this game than poor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Gordon</a> or Edward. The role of the Bard is to sing Songs, some of which mimic other spells (like Stop and Charm) while others buff the stats of the party. It's quite useful to have a Bard singing a Song which increases everyone's strength or level, for example. They really shine in a select dungeon, where the Requiem song will lay waste to all undead enemies. The Bard's other ability is the "Hide" command, which works the same way as Edward's: the Bard runs off screen, where they can't be harmed by anything. Some of the worst attacks can be dodged in this way, including Grand Cross, the multi-target spell used by the final boss.
</li><li> The Dancer seems like a pretty awful class. They are pitiful attackers, but they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">have a 1/4 chance of using Sword Dance</a>, which does a lot of damage. A special Tiara can boost their chances to 50/50. Dancers also have atrocious stats. It takes luck for Dancers to even stay alive long enough to use Sword Dance, but it's honestly not a huge problem at the end of the game, when you can buff their speed and strike before the enemy gets a turn. They hit their peak in the final dungeon, with the ability to hold two weapons at once (Dual-Wield), a set of Dancer-exclusive equipment, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpamAttack">Rapid Fire</a>. With the right weapons, they will consistently deal more damage than Mystic Knight, the heavy-hitter of the group.

<ul><li> Mog the moogle. His Dances are under-whelming for the most part, and you lose control of him. You don't want to rely on Dance, anyway, because there's a good chance it just won't work in areas that have "special" terrain, like the final dungeon. But the only weapons he has are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick">spears</a>, which are decent but not great. Mog's hidden strength lies is his ability to tank. He has the best natural defense stat in the game. Mog is so versatile, he can be a good tank or a mage, but there are plenty of other characters who are good with magic; power him up into a fighter, and he can be surprisingly OP with the right equipment. When equipped with the Snow Muffler, his Defense is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cap">capped</a> at 255, causing all physical attacks to fail when he's in the back row. Couple that with the Paladin Shield (earned by wearing the worthless Cursed Shield into 255 battles or something like that), a Ribbon, and a pair of Marvel Shoes, and it is possible to make him immune to virtually all attacks. You can also find a charm for Mog which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncounterRepellant">eliminates random encounters</a> when he's equipped with it.
</li><li> Relm clones her current opponent and uses their own specials against them. She starts off pretty useless: her physical stats are a joke, she attacks with <em>a paintbrush</em>, and Sketch (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualBeta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualBeta">even when it works</a>) is not very useful. The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a> has a whole FAQ on it, pointing out where it's useful and such, and still concludes that <em>"This move is awful"</em> says everything. But take a look at her stat screen, and you realize that she has the highest natural Magic in the game. The real issue is her spellist; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverratedAndUnderleveled">she's way behind everyone else.</a> Since Relm is one of the only characters who can use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicWand">Rods</a>, they're excellent in her hands if you nail an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">elemental weakness</a>. And speaking of Magic power, those elemental rods run off of it. She also can equip the Healing Rod and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">heal party members by attacking them</a>; only Strago and Banon (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a>) can do the same. Sketch <em>does</em> have good applications, like killing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slimes</a> (Cactuars). Even her Control ability doesn't get much love: Relm can brainwash enemies if she's wearing the Fake Mustache accessory.

The Defense of the Imp is very good, but their offense is very crappy. This changes if you find every piece of Imp Equipment in the second half of the game. Some are found normally, whereas others are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareRandomDrop">Rare Random Drops</a>, or have to be won in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterArena">Monster Arena</a>.

Shadow can make use of them to reach 255 Magic Defense and 128 Evade. Then there's the Leviathan fight: wear one piece of Imp armor to absorb his water attacks.

<ol><li>Most random encounters can be trivialized by performing a Dance, most of which incapcitate them. Sleep/Stop works on most enemies, while Silence is preferable for spellslingers.

She also has her Sing abilities, with Matador's Song increasing your party's Evasion chances by 100%! It should be used against any brawny opponent. Situational? Yes, but these abilities are insanely broken when called for.

Equip her with an accessory which causes Slow and she'll clean house. You can also have three Songstresses in the party at once.

Armor Break, Power Break, and Excalibur (Holy damage) are learned by the Warrior, but with Lady Luck, you aren't lumbered with a slow-moving tank. She can become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCaddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemCaddy">Item Caddy</a> for rare items like Dark Matter. Casting high-level White Magic (most importantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutoRevive">Auto-Life</a>) and Black Magic (Flare, Ultima) is just a big "FU" to bosses. Megalixir+ and Mighty Guard+ are superior versions of anything the Mages or Alchemist can muster up.
</li><li> Mascot offers unique abilities to each girl: Yuna (Moogle) has recovery magic and party buffs, Rikku (Cait Sith) has offensive magic and debuffs, and Paine (Tonberry) has Knife attacks and status ailments. Rikku has a multi-target Eject which targets <em>all</em> enemies and removes them from the battlefield to end the fight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">as long as they're not immune to Eject anyways</a>). Plus they all come with abilities based off two of the other jobs, and they all have Ribbon as an auto-ability. Ribbon is normally one of the rarest accessories in <em>Final Fantasy</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The portly Duane in <em>Kingdom Under Fire: Circle of Doom</em> is the only character who has no achievement for beating the game, has no real story quests to speak of, has comical dream sequences and foppish costumery, and tends to fall over when Dashing. His ranged attacks, though, are some of the strongest.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> multiplayer, the Volus race is this to a "T." They look like half-naked, bionic molerats. Plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">they're pacifists</a>. And they carry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunSize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunSize">Fun Size</a> guns? For all the jokes at the Volus' expense, they're literally the only race who immediately support Shepard unconditionally in ME3. (ironically they <em>don't</em> get a seat on the Council whereas all the other races want to do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoOmniscientCouncilOfBickering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoOmniscientCouncilOfBickering">is dither and bicker</a>.) Now take a look at their statuses: nothing but pitiful health, worthless shields and cumbersome weapon weight. They can't cover through walls or perform a conventional melee attack.
<ul><li> However, once you get used to the Volus, you notice that, not only does their Shield Boost ability restore shields to both the user <em>and</em> allies in its radius, it also can be specced to increase damage resistance by a whopping 40% when active. It also makes the makes the user (not the allies) invincible for a second. A well-timed Shield Boost can even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChunkySalsaRule">Chunky Salsa Rule</a> in some cases! Their light melee is replaced by an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibilityCloak">Invisibility Cloak</a>, and their heavy melee is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeehiveBarrier">Beehive Barrier</a> which (like Shield Boost) provides a moment of invincibility, followed by a huge defense boost and minor shield regeneration; it also does mild damage to enemies within melee range and staggers them. Stack both effects with a Cyclonic Modulator IV, and the Volus can be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> to rival all characters except the Geth Juggernaut. (Its already-crazy defense can be amplified with a Volus Shield Boost and the DR buff.)
</li><li> Also, in case you haven't noticed, they're short. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitScan">Hitscan</a> weaponry doesn't track the barrel of the weapon which fired it, so they can technically hide behind chest-high walls without taking cover.
</li><li> Volus are immune to the slowdown-while-firing effects of weapons such as the N7 Typhoon and Reegar Carbine. The Volus Adept or Vanguard cleverly use of the Biotic Orb's passive cooldown buffs to a) wield heavier weapons than normal, and b) use their bionics to keep their barriers up.
</li><li> The Volus Sentinel stands out even among the volus. Apart from the barrier, all of their attacks are dependant on firearms. But with crafty use of Decoy, Combat Drone, and Shield Boost, they are quite capable of soloing even the highest difficulties... If you've got a few hours to kill, anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Might and Magic Kings Bounty</em>, the Sorceress is often described as the worst character in the game, due to her low Leadership and bad starting army. Indeed her start can be a little more difficult. Leadership only affects the amount of troops you can recruit and can be easily raised by giving money to your troops, and the Sorceress has the best gold income which only gets better; said income also lets you replace your army. She has the ability to cast spells, something that is costly and time-consuming for others, and this allows her to win early fights with fewer troops and resources than other characters. Before you're off the first island, her advantages will easily eclipse her disadvantages: you're put in a stronger position in less time than other characters, your gold income is higher than anyone else's, and you're able to field the best army even though you wouldn't need an army as strong as the other characters to win battles! In the Genesis version, once she reaches her level 2 form, she can chain time stop into time stop giving you an infinite amount of time to complete the objective, even on hard, annihilating the game balance.
</li><li> The gimmick of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterRancher">Monster Rancher</a></em> is training up a seemingly-harmless enemy into a fearsome fighter. The more ridiciulous, the better. The species with the greatest inverse proportion between silly appearance and lethality are:
<ul><li> The Monols, which are essentially giant, hovering, blank rectangular slabs of rock. Naturally, however, they have powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> capabilities (because that's literally what they are), and they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psionic abilities</a> hidden deep within their bodies that make them strong magic-based attackers.
</li><li> The Suzurins, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerRabbit">adorable species of creatures who resemble wind chimes</a> and whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium">Monster Compendium</a> data states they cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity">Cuteness Proximity</a> in everyone they meet. They're actually masters of the <em><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOrGloryAttack">Death-or-Glory Attack</a></strong></em>, who may not always hit, but <em>one hit is all they need.</em>
</li><li> The Doodles, who are literally <em>living stick figures.</em> In both games they appear in, they're the last monster you'll unlock. Their specialty? Lots and <em>lots</em> of expensive attacks that do <em>massive</em> damage.
</li></ul></li><li> The Tokos in both the PS3 and (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Japan-only</a>) DS versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiNoKuni">Ni no Kuni</a>.</em> In the PS3 version, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetalSlime">Metal Slimes</a> that level up <em>extremely</em> slowly, and have a tiny level capâ€”but their magic defense and evasion go up <em>exponentially</em> with each level, making them obscene magical tanks. In the DS version, the opposite is trueâ€”they level up <em>ridiculously</em> quickly, and have extremely high magic attack and MP, but only learn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">status skills</a>. However, if given gems to give them different skills, they can become <em>insane</em> healers and magic attackers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PersonaQShadowOfTheLabyrinth">Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth</a></em> has Teddie. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em>, Teddie was one of the team's only two capable healers and had more balanced moveset and stats than Yukiko at it, making which of them you used a pure matter of strategy. In <em>Persona Q</em> however movesets are mostly decided by Sub-Personas (essentially equipable summons) and Teddie is left with with some of the worst Defense and Speed Stats of the game's 18 playable characters, combined with only average Mana for a character who is primarily supposed to be a Magic User and HP that can't possibly keep him alive long enough to make up for all these shortcomings. To put the final nail in his coffin, his Attack Power is merely average, also eliminating all sense in using him as a Damage Dealer. His only good stats are Magic - which is hindered by aforementioned low Mana-Bar - and Luck, a stat which serves no other purpose than to increase the rate of Critical Hits dealt by physical attacks. This, however, is where the "Lethal"-part of this trope comes into play: The Persona Series is known for using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ShinMegamiTensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> series' "Press Turn"-style of battle system, which makes dealing Criical Hits or hits to the enemy's elemental weaknesses <em>crucial</em> to win battles. In numbered Persona-games, hitting a Critical or a weakness would result in the character gaining an additional action the same turn - In <em>Persona Q</em> it results in "Boost", which means the character's stats (especially speed) are boosted very notably for an entire round <em>and they become able to use any Magic or Skill for 0 Mana or HP cost in the following round</em>. Since the only way to break this "Boost" is to deal physical damage to the character before he can attack and Teddie's low base speed will cause him to attack last in the round he first deals the critical and first in the round that he has boosted, it's nigh impossible to break Teddie out of boosted state, meaning his low Mana suddenly becomes entirely irrelevant, as he becomes able to use <em>any</em> Magic for no cost, as long as he can strike another Critical Hit with a physical skill any other round. And all it takes to ensure that this will happen is a Sub-Persona with a Multi-Hit Skill that hits the enemy 3 times or more in one attack.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona5">Persona 5</a></em>: The twins, the game's ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, use super-powered versions of low-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mook</a> Personas, such as Bugs, Agathion, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesMascot">Series Mascot</a> the Jack Bros.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">PokÃ©mon</a></em> has a few examples:
<ul><li> The most famous of these is Wobbuffet. When it was first introduced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver">PokÃ©mon Gold and Silver</a></em>, its gimmick of only being able to counterattack and having a tiny movepool of only 4 moves left it quite difficult to use if you weren't good at predicting your opponent. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">Gen III</a> happened, with advent of its ability Shadow Tag, which prevents the foe from switching out against it, and the expansion its movepool <em>ever</em> so slightly thanks to the introduction of a Baby Form that can learn Encore, a move that forces the opponent to repeat the last move used. Suddenly, it made the jump from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Smogon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Smogon">never-used tier</a> to so unbelievably broken that no competitive player will agree to play against one<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note73os1');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note73os1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note73os1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(especially since two Wobbufetts, both holding the same certain item, could result in the game becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">Unwinnable by Mistake</a>; this was was fixed in later generations)</span>, a designation it shares only with the most powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>. It wasn't until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlackAndWhite">PokÃ©mon Black and White</a></em> that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a> finally caught up with it. And even then it's still considered a major threat, just not so much that it should be banned.
</li><li> Then there's Dunsparce, who in Gen III gained the Serene Grace ability, which increases the chance to inflict a status effect. This means that players could completely immobilize the enemy opponent if being taught moves which caused confusion, paralysis, freezing, attraction, flinching and others much more easily than any other "annoyer" pokemon. A very popular strategy is based on its ability to learn Glare, a rare move (restricted to snake-like Pokemon group, which Dunsparce belongs to) that paralyzes the enemy with 100% accuracy. If the enemy is not an Electric type, the resulting paralysis will give it a 25% chance of skipping a turn, and its speed will be cut in half. Dunsparce is slow, so, if its enemy is not a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Fragile Speedster</a> who will still outspeed it even when paralyzed, Dunsparce could repeatedly attack it with Headbutt or Bite, which will get a 60% chance of making enemy skip its turn. The result: a nearly immobilized enemy with a miserable chance of attacking.
</li><li> Quagsire has some of the worst stats for a fully evolved PokÃ©mon, but strangely has some of the best abilities in the game. Unaware allows it to completely ignore enemy stat boosts, rendering setup strategies useless. This only got more potent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSwordAndShield">Generation VIII</a>, whose Dynamax mechanic is centered around stat changes, and Quagsire has quickly become a go-to PokÃ©mon to counter Dynamax. Its typing of water and ground is a double edged sword too, giving it access to a diverse movepool and decent coverage, but at the expense of severe weakness to grass types. By all accounts, it just cannot be predicted, and has been played in literally every tier in the metagame.
<div class="indent"> <strong>False Swipe Gaming:</strong> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGwe4o73xW4">"How good was Quagsire ACTUALLY? Man, I don't f***g know."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>
</div></li><li> Smeargle has astoundingly horrible stats, but it's still popular because it can learn and use almost every move in the game, with very few exceptions. This leads to a very effective moveset where Smeargle can Baton Pass the effect of Ingrain, making the next Pokemon immune to Whirlwind and Roar (switching out without Baton Pass forfeits all stat boosts and other similar temporary statuses) and being able to recover an additional 1/16th of max HP each turn. There's also the Endure/Spore/Endeavor/Dragon Rage w/Salac berry combo, a variant of the FEAR strategy below. Speed is the only decent stat Smeargle gets, and it's the only stat it needs. Another Smeargle strategy sometimes seen has Smeargle use Spore to put the opposing PokÃ©mon to sleep, then use Transform to turn into the opposing PokÃ©mon. Since this also copies that PokÃ©mon's stats (excluding HP), Smeargle effectively catches up to the opponent in stats while they're unable to attack. Even more terrifyingly, when the Dream World was active, it used to get Moody as an active ability, which allows it to increase one stat while reducing another, an ability that has already proved broken on things like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Bidoof</a></em>. In addition to being able to pile up random boosts from its ability, it could Baton Pass them to a real sweeper. After that, cue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">Total Party Kill</a>.
</li><li> Shedinja is another Mon that may fit this trope. With a max HP of 1, most people would think this is a joke character, but the fact that it is only affected by attacks that are super effective means that it is immune to 13 out of 18 types of attack, making it invincible when used against the right enemies, most notably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Kyogre</a> and <em>Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Deoxys</span>. Gen V introduced the move Soak, which changes the PokÃ©mon's type to Water. If you have an ally PokÃ©mon use it on Shedinja in a double battle, it will only be affected by Electric and Grass attacks: both being relatively uncommon move types to see in competitive battling compared to the omnipresent Fire and Rock.
<ul><li> How about 'Sturdinja'; a Shedinja that has been given Insomnia via 'Worry Seed', then Skill Swapped 'Sturdy'. With one HP, Sturdy will always activate, and since you are always going from 100% health it gets around multi-hit moves. The only way to beat it is to hit it with weather or status moves, and even that may not work, due to the Safety Goggles item and Lum Berry Recycling, respectively. You can see it in action <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciuAcwbny6w">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where it uses Final Gambit to finish off the fight.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">HeartGold and SoulSilver</a></em>, contests are replaced by the PokÃ©athlon, a sport variety of Minigames. Each PokÃ©mon has different stats in a category for how well they do in the competitions. The officially weakest PokÃ©mon, Sunkern, has PokÃ©athlon stats comparable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a>; the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyCuteCritter">Mew</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Giratina's</a> Origin Forme, and <strong>the</strong> Olympus Mon itself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Arceus</a>. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifter">Ditto</a>. On top of that, its slightly-better evolved form, Sunflora, doesn't have these stats. However, its maximum stats are full, but its base stats are 1. And there is no way to get them all to full.
</li><li> Rotom was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> levitating Electric/Ghost type with an awesome movepool/typing but average stats introduced in Diamond and Pearl... which, in Platinum, gained the ability to transform into a handful of ridiculous alternate forms, such as a washing machine, toaster oven, lawn mower, handheld fan, and refrigerator. Now, these frankly ridiculous variants? They have excellent defensive stats, special moves that give them great coverage, and very nice Special Attack. Meaning that one of the best PokÃ©mon in the game... is a washing machine. Of course, anyone who actually looks at its stats will notice right away that Rotom's appliance forms are no joke, but if you just have this kinda useless PokÃ©mon that suddenly transforms into an appliance...
</li><li> There's also Spinda, a Pokemon usually lambasted for its TERRIBLE stats. However, with the introduction of the Dream World, it gained access to the ability Contrary, which turns its stat drops into stat boosts. The Dream World also gave it the move Superpower, which would normally cut its Attack and Defense, but now RAISES them instead. Unfortunately, the only way to get a Spinda with this move is if you got it from the Dream World, and when move tutors in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">PokÃ©mon Black 2 and White 2</a></em> started teaching Superpower, Spinda didn't get it.
<ul><li> It does still have <em>one</em> little trick it can do with this ability: Skill Swap. When partnered up in a double battle with the likes of Arcanine (or any other Close Combat user, but Arcanine is the most popular choice because of Overheat, Morning Sun, and Intimidate), Spinda itself still crumples quickly, but not before setting up its partner to be an unstoppable monster.
</li><li> It also has access to the move Assist, which randomly uses a teammate's move. A niche battling option is to pair Spinda with one teammate which only knows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">V-Create,</a> which deals massive damage in exchange for dropping defenses and speed. Spinda, being Contrary, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">does not have this drawback.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> This PokÃ©mon, while usually only used to learn lots of HM moves, becomes surprisingly beasty when its Hidden Ability Moody is in play. This ability makes it randomly gain a noticeable boost in one stat and a slight drop in another each turn. With enough stalling, it can become such a surprisingly deadly force that it was nearly banned. Who's that PokÃ©mon? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bibarel.</span> This PokÃ©mon was not particularly shabby in the 4th gen, if proper use was made of the Simple ability (doubling all stat changes) and its tremendous movepool (including a handful of buffs and a variety of decent attacks).
</li><li> Ditto (the trope namer for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DittoFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DittoFighter">Ditto Fighter</a>) was always a fun gimmick, but was so fragile that using it was pointless as it needed to spend a turn to transform into the opponent. In Generation V however, Ditto was given the ability Imposter. This lets Ditto transform into the enemy's Pokemon immediately upon being sent out. Instantly gaining the ability, stats, buffs and moves of an enemy Pokemon was powerful enough in Gen V, but with the introduction of Mega Evolutions, Ditto became even more ridiculously dangerous due to the fact that it can copy the Mega Pokemon but has its item slot free to power it even further. Ditto can also employ <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> when it copies a Mega Evolution: You are not allowed to mega-evolve more than one Pokemon per battle. Since Ditto doesn't need to mega-evolve to transform into a Mega Evolved PokÃ©mon, Ditto allows you to functionally have two Mega Evolutions on your team.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonSunAndMoon">PokÃ©mon Sun and Moon</a></em> introduce Pyukumuku, who, like Wobbuffet, learns no attacking moves. However, with its great defenses, it can stall to victory using a combination of Curse, Recover, and Toxic. Even if the opponent has typing that is immune to poisoning (Steel or Poison), Pyukumuku can learn Soak to turn them into Water type and to lay down a Toxic attack anyway. It's also capable of learning Counter to pay its opponent back. Also, Pyukumuku has two Abilities to back up its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a> status: Innards Out allows it to deal the same amount of damage to its opponent as the move that KO'd it dealt to it, and Unaware ignores all status buffs on its opponent, which means that even if Pyukumuku's opponent is a severely boosted sweeper, it will still do normal damage to that little rotund thing. Finally, its signature move, Purify, heals any status condition it may have, and, should it succeed, heals Pyukumuku for up to 50% of its max HP. When upgraded to a Z-Move, Z-Purify multiplies all of the user's stats by 1.5 as well.
</li><li> Diggersby is one of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComMons">Com Mons</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">PokÃ©mon X and Y</a></em> with a lot of mediocre stats but has a Hidden Ability in Huge Power, which doubles the damage of its physical attacks. As a Ground-type, this means Diggersby carries some of the most painful Earthquake attacks in the game (thanks to the same-type attack bonus) and one of the few PokÃ©mon able to consistently defeat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Aegislash</a> one-on-one. This power can also be backed up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Agility</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">Swords Dance</a> to get Diggersby to dangerous levels.
</li><li> Farfetch'd really got to shine in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonRubyAndSapphire">PokÃ©mon Ruby and Sapphire</a></em>'s PokÃ©mon Contests, as one of the few PokÃ©mon able to learn the Swords Dance and False Swipe combination, the Swords Dance and Slash combination, and the Peck and Fury Attack combination solely through level-up. These combinations earn double Appeal points and can be used for different purposes (False Swipe will reduce the opponents' Appeal points, Slash is worth a lot of points, and Fury Attack will take the judge's attention away from another PokÃ©mon), allowing Farfetch'd to adapt to any situation and dominate any category of contest at any rank without having to breed or expend TMs. Farfetch'd is also a lot more useful when given its signature item, the Stick. This increases its critical hit ratio by two stages all the time, and Farfetch'd can learn several moves like Razor Leaf that have a natural increased crit ratio as well (while using its physical Attack stat, which has a base value of 90). It might not have the best stats, but anything that can crit on a 1/4 chance (as opposed to 1/16) has the potential to deal damage. Gen VI changed up how criticals work, which means Farfetch'd can effectively crit on a <em>1/2 chance</em> instead.
</li><li> Clefairy, of all PokÃ©mon, has become quite feared in double battling, especially when paired against another Lethal Joke Character who's popped up at the same time, Eevee. Clefairy has the Ability "Friend Guard," which reduces its own damage and that of its teammates when in a double or triple battle, and since it's not fully evolved, can take advantage of the hold item Eviolite to reduce its damage further, turning it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>. Clefairy can also learn Follow Me to direct all opponents' attacks towards itself, which complements this setup very well. Eevee, meanwhile, can use its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureMove">Signature Move</a> Extreme Evoboost to double all of its stats, then use Baton Pass the next turn to transfer the doubled stats to something else. It got so bad that Extreme Evoboost got banned on Smogon's double battling.
</li><li> Clefairy's case is hardly unique; there are many PokÃ©mon that are awful in single battles but excellent in doubles, and a few with the reverse. They include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">defensive behemoths</a> with lots of supportive moves, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> PokÃ©mon with weaknesses counterbalanced by a partner, and PokÃ©mon with powerful abilities or moves that only work in doubles. Probably the most famous one was a situation where a Pachirisu turned out to be instrumental in the 2014 World Championship - its nonexistent offense turned out to be irrelevant when it was teamed up with a Garchomp, leaving it free to absorb hits through Follow Me, paralyze through Nuzzle, and chomp chunks of health with Super Fang.
</li><li> Slaking is the final evolution of Slakoth with the same crippling Ability of <em>Truant</em> allowing it to move only once every two turns. The lethal part is how its stats are on par with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Olympus Mons</a></em>, and can even <em>exceed</em> them in some aspects. Tactics were developed to get rid of his crippling Ability for single<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1u8vu');"><sup>hintÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1u8vu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1u8vu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Cofagrigus and Pursuit</span> and multiple battles, and once it's off it becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">Lightning Bruiser</a> fully capable of wiping the entire enemy team by itself.
</li><li> Eiscue is a relatively recent attempt by Game Freak at making a defensive Ice-type work, a type that has only found success in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> builds, but this time, this little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithPenguins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithPenguins">penguin</a> pulls this off via Ice Face, an ice cube head that surrounds its real head and can absorb any physical attack, no matter how strong it is. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Max Moves</a>. The result is a PokÃ©mon not found in a lot of teams, but one that has wreaked havoc on opponents when one <em>does</em> appear due to its surprising versatility, from wasting Dynamax turns to safely setting up Belly Drum, which quadruples Eiscue's Attack stat. Incidentally, Eiscue can also qualify as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingClown">Fighting Clown</a> due to that ice cube head looking as ridiculous as it sounds.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonConquest">PokÃ©mon Conquest</a></em>, every Pokemon species knows one specific attack (although multiple species can share the same move). Musharna's attack is Dream Eater, and just like the main series it only damages sleeping enemies. This makes it almost never useful, since very few things in the game can even induce sleep - you could bring a Munna, who learns Hypnosis, but that's dedicating two party members just to make one member practical. However, if you inspect Musharna's Abilities, it turns out they both have the same effect - a random chance to make enemies nearby fall asleep as a free action at the start of your turn. You have to hope for the RNG to be kind, but if it activates then Dream Eater turns from pathetic to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantDeathRadius">"Instant Death" Radius</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Robopon">Robopon</a>'s</em> first game has Teabot. Teabot is a little robot whose entire purpose is serving tea. You get one from your grandpa for completing your tower, and it's implied he bought it from a TV shopping channel. Its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterCompendium">Monster Compendium</a> data outright calls it "useless." Tell that to its high-powered software, and the fact that its <em>basic attack</em> can scrap enemies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKO">one hit.</a>
</li><li> DLC character Mintberry Crunch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheFracturedButWhole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a></em> while he's one of the only three characters to have actual Superpowers, the fact that they are centered around Mint-and-Berry flavored cereal may seem ridiculous. But in-game they translate into a very powerful support character: the "mint" buff dispels negative status on allies and gives them some defense, while the "berry" status causes enemies' attacks to be weaker, plus if a "berried" enemy attacks a "minted" character, they will recieve no damage. And to make it even more powerful, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> applies mint to all allies, berry to all enemies <em>and</em> causes damage to the enemies to boot!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarControlII">Star Control II</a></em> has the Thraddash Torch ship. It's got laughably small crew (ergo less health), low speed, and a puny blaster which does pitiful damage at a pitiful fire rate. However, its special move is an afterburner that makes it the fastest ship in the game when used correctly... and unlike most other fast ships, its "puny" blaster has a long range and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnblockableAttack">can't be stopped by point-defense</a>. As such, a skilled player can use the Torch's extreme maneuverability to stay out of range while inflicting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">Death of a Thousand Cuts</a>. It's <em>so</em> good at this, in fact, that it's the only ship customarily banned from competitive play.
<ul><li> Also, in-universe as well, the Spathi Eluder. It looks ridiculous. Its charge is tiny (severely limiting weapon fire rates), its forward gun's effect is both narrow and with a short range, and its secondary weapon is missiles that do little damage and have a lousy range. However, it is faster than any other ship in the game using only its engines, and it is <em>impossible</em> to catch up with and hit the thing. And the aforementioned missiles both fire out from the back and home in on enemies. It will just keep flying away <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">hitting you with missiles over and over</a> while you futilely try to catch up eating the entire trail.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> series:
<ul><li> Sheena. He's a lecherous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> with not-so-special stats. Basically, a character that most casual players would never use. However, long-time players of Suikoden swear by him, because he has something casual players tend to overlook. Sheena comes with three free Rune Slots, giving him insane twinking potential. With very little effort, one could very easily turn him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>.
</li><li> An even worse case is Hai Yo, who could also acquire three free rune slots... and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChefOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChefOfIron">cook</a>.
</li><li> In the third game, the dogs, which are normally just pathetic, can perform a united attack that can do over <em>4,000</em> damage to an enemy.
</li><li> There's also the beavers: Cute talking critters and elite waterborne soldiers. Correctly used, they will turn most army battles into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">sick jokes</a> and to add insult to injury, they don't even <em>have</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>: storywise, it's when they join the heroes that their army start to get the upper hand in the war.
</li><li> An interesting addition is Viki; up until 5, she was an above average mage but always fell short to other more powerful spellcasters. However, in this edition, she is a definite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>, as her unique skill 'Chain Magic', when fully upgraded, can clear entire battlefields due to her ability to cast very powerful spells a second time at no additional cost about 60%-80% of the time! Equip her with a Fire, Lightning, or Pale Gate Rune and watch the destruction!!
</li><li> The original had Milich. (Whose true gender is never clarified.) <em>IV</em> had Schtolteheim Reinbach III. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII">Suikoden III</a></em> has Augustine Nabor. This member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDandy">Narcissist archetype</a> (most of which are fairly useless characters) requires you to purchase a rare and pricey item to recruit him: a Rose Brooch. Just like the lottery results, it can disappear if you try and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scum</a> to get it. He has the ability to raise his Parry stat up to an S rank naturally. This allows him to fend off any non-magicial attack with ease. Give him a second Brooch and you can bring his Swing stat up to an S, allowing him to perform 5 sword swings instead of his usual 2 or 3. He is a mirror image of Yuber in this game, Yuber being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarthVaderClone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarthVaderClone">resident Darth Vader</a>. It's pretty cool seeing them go toe-to-toe, pitting them against each other in the Budehuc Castle siege. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink">And seeing Augustine come out on top!</a>
</li><li> Also from <em>III</em>, Rico. The retainer to knight-errant Fred Maximilian, she looks like Strawberry Shortcake, has virtually no magical ability to speak of, and her weapon is a hammer which maxes out at two hits, tops. Her Combination Attack with Fred deals double damage, but puts her in the turn-skipping "Unbalanced" state. Then you look at her skill list and realize that she can build up to an A+ rank in a rare skill that prevents Unbalanced...meaning you can spam the Combination Attack (almost) every turn.
</li><li> Finally, there's Juan. This straw-chewing bumpkin is one of the residents of Budehuc Castle, and is permanently saddled with a Waking Rune, which forces him to start each battle with the Sleep status! This is easily fixable with a Yellow Scarf accessory, though, and as a martial artist, his Swing skill is extremely high; at higher levels, he can get as many as <em>six</em> attacks per round in a game where fast normal attacks are key.
</li></ul></li><li> Johnny in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfDestiny">Tales of Destiny</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">Spoony Bard</a> with all around average stats and starts off underleveled. Buff his stats with boosting herbs, however, and one of his final attacks, Malware Rondo, will deal a great deal of damage to and juggle bosses with ease. Did we mention it's a Sonic type attack, and all late-game enemies are weak to the Sonic type?
<ul><li> In the original PSX version, he only learns items with Scores scattered around the world. However, one of these Scores teaches him a healing move more effective and quicker to cast than anything Rutee, the healer, can learn.
</li></ul></li><li> Chat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfEternia">Tales of Eternia</a></em>, as an optional character, only has two attack moves (and one of them only steals an item) and doesn't learn any more by leveling. However, go on her sidequests to teach her the Sacred Pirate Skills and she becomes a powerful status inflicter with good elemental coverage and stun attacks. Then there's her ultimate move, Eternal Hammer, which lets her throw hammers until she runs out of mana. Bosses will be stunlocked by the unstoppable rain of stun hammers, letting everyone else spam mana healing items on her and maybe casting a few spells here and there to speed up the death process.

She appears to be a frail girl, that, well, needs protecting â€” barely capable of holding her own in a fight. With only mediocre stats, low speed, an odd fighting style and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialStupidity">bad AI</a>, one would think she's not worth keeping in the party â€” even her magic is bad (a simple, low damage light spell, a status buff that takes forever to cast, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> spell that kills <em>her</em>, and lastly a flashy spell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATeamFiring">that hardly hits anything</a>) so why is she called a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a>? She gets the game's strongest Physical Special Attacks â€” including one that only uses 14 TP, deals massive (x4.6) damage (and it's Lightning Elemental â€” a LOT of the game's enemies are weak to it...), another that can do x10 damage â€” and that stacks with another hidden ability: Her seemingly weak Pow Hammer attack can become Toss Hammer, a poisoning attack that NOTHING IN THE GAME (not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>) is resistant to, and anything afflicted by it drops its HP down to 1 in a minute (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNhMevZ7-0k">this in action<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>).

If you have enough skill in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSymbiote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSymbiote">Symbiote</a> ability, you can fuse this to yourself and fire <em>rockets.</em> These work <em>very</em> well against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Nazgul.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenogears">Xenogears</a></em> includes Chu-Chu, a disgustingly-cute, pink hamster creature. She has zero Deathblow combos, very low stats, and a mediocre skillset in general. However, she does have two saving graces: she is the only character who can heal other characters while in a Gear. Said "Gear" is simply Chu-Chu herself, having grown to giant size, so she retains all of her usual stats. That's the key: if you have a lot of time on your hands, you can feed her hundreds of Drives and potentially make her the strongest character in the game, even surpassing the titular Xenogears in damage output and durability. But this requires purchasing said items from Big Joe at 10,000 or 20,000 gold a throw (which is no small sum even in the endgame). It's unsurprising that few, if any, players have ever attempted it.

The disproportionate stats were due to the way that swimming, which they are always doing, is treated as strength training.

<ul><li> In the 2012 version: Giant. Sponge. It can't move. It can't bite or kick. It can't breathe air. However, its mass is so great that it can kill dwarves with the default "push" attack that all living things are coded to have, and because it lacks vital organs, it's impossible to kill without air-drowning or massive damage. Undead giant sponges <em>can</em> move and leave the water, <em>are</em> aggressive, and massive damage is literally the only way to stop them pushing all your dwarves to death.
</li><li> Elves. They're usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt Monkeys</a> of the <em>Dwarf Fortress</em> universe, since they're ridiculously easy to anger (just cut down trees- which you'll need to do to get wood) and their sieges are easy to break, since all their equipment is wooden. However, elves have very good base stats and the adherence to wooden armament is a cultural thing, so elves who are part of other civilizations (most commonly because they were snatched at birth by goblins) and are thus willing to use steel can become serious threats, or assets if they're on your side. One such legendary elf is Cacame Awemedinade the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Immortal Onslaught</a>, who has done such things as killing a dragon in a few blows and breaking sieges by himself in defense of the fortress that he rules.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Freespace">Freespace</a></em> has the GTB Athena, designated as a light bomber, although it is unable to carry heavy warheads, thus making it rather useless for strikes on capital ships, which is what a bomber is supposed to be all about. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotTheIntendedUse">However</a>, when you compare it to many of the fighters in the game, it actually has decent speed and maneuverability, better durability, ammo capacity, and better placed primary hardpoints, as well as a thin profile that makes it difficult to hit. If it wasn't for its inability to carry a few of the more advanced primary cannons, it would easily be the best fighter craft in the game.
<ul><li> Freespace 2 introduces the GTF Myrmidon, which is the first ship you get to fly in the game. Despite the tech room hyping it up, it is in fact relatively slow, lacks maneuverability, can't carry much ordnance, has bad primary hardpoint placement, has a large target profile, and can't carry the best dogfighting missile in the game. What most people don't realize though, is that it (likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">unintentionally</a>) has the capability to carry the Helios torpedo, the strongest warhead in the game which is otherwise reserved exclusively for heavy bombers. This makes a wing of Myrmidons acting as fast strike bombers a deadly threat to any capital ship.

To train a class, one must first pay to acquire a building where you can upgrade a villager, and then an additional fee for eacfirsh citizen converted. One such job is the "Gourmet Chef" class, which costs a tidy sum. However, once you have one, you learn he/she is near <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">completely useless</a>! They have mediocre stats, and can hardly do any work at all. However, you soon learn they can one-hit kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">giant chickens</a>, a very common and strong enemy. This turns them into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChefOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChefOfIron">Chef of Iron</a>. While this may seem situational, you will thank your lucky stars when you enter a kingdom populated almost entirely of them.
</li><li> The Harasser hovercraft in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior Living Legends</a></em> has laughable armor, crap weapons, gets outran by some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mechs</a> that carry 3 times the weapons, and is prone to spontaneously flipping over from touching small rocks. The Harasser Delta "Toast 'n' Go" variant, better know as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Flamasser</a>, carries a loadout of 6 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireBreathingWeapon">flamethrowers</a>. Like the other Harassers, it is hilariously top heavy and the addition of the flamethrowers makes the hovercraft melt when you fire. However, when carefully used, those 6 flamethrowers also cause enemy mechs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeating">overheat so much that their arms fall off</a>, instantly causes the fusion reactors on aerospace fighters to explode, and melts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerArmor">battlearmor</a> in their suits. A newbie in one of these things is a free kill, while a pro driving one is an unstoppable boiling engine of fire and death spinning across the level at 160kph. A second deadly Harasser was added in 0.7.0, which carries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamSpam">6 small X-pulse lasers</a> capable of plinking away enemy armor with astonishing speed.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Sparrowhawk scout plane</a> is likewise a useless death trap in most players hands, but it is the destroyer-of-worlds in the hands of a pro pilot, as it is the single most agile unit in the game, capable of flying at <em>30 kph</em> with no issues, or flying <em>inside</em> an enemy hangar and shoot at players repairing before safely doing a backflip and flying out. It has several variants designed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">specifically for taking out anything flying</a>, as no other plane is capable of shaking off a Sparrowhawk if one gets on its tail, or, god help the enemy plane, if the Sparrowhawk is actually <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader">riding on</a></em> the enemy's tail.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MechWarrior">MechWarrior Online</a></em> introduced the UrbanMech, an infamous "walking trash can" with horribly slow top speed (comparable to 'Mechs <em>three weight classes above it</em>) and light armor. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">original tabletop game</a>, the Urbie was meant for patrolling urban areas (where high speed isn't essential) and was primarily an anti-personnel vehicle, as well as being very cheap and easy to mass-produce. None of these are factors in the pure 'Mech vs 'Mech gameplay <em>Online</em> features, which also happens to be the area in which the UrbanMech is least useful. However, the UrbanMech is capable of mounting almost hilariously powerful weapons like an AC 20, giving it firepower far beyond what most Light 'Mechs are capable of, and if the player installs a powerful engine in it (somewhat expensive, but doable) it can achieve a respectable top speed that makes it a contender with other Light 'Mechs, if still a bit on the slow side. It's also the only 'Mech in the game capable of rotating its torso a full 360 degrees, meaning it has no true blind spots one can exploit for a sneak attack.
</li><li> In <em>Star Wars: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RogueSquadron">Rogue Squadron</a></em>, the second game <em>Rogue Leader</em> features two bonus ships that both qualify as this:
<ul><li> On the "joke" side, there's Boba Fett's ship, <em>Slave 1</em>. It's slower than the Y-Wing (if you can believe that), can't turn worth a damn, has lousy shields, and its bottom-mounted blasters are awkward if not impossible to aim with. If an enemy ship gets behind you, you're dead. However, it has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Homing Cluster Missiles.</a> One shot can wipe out entire squadrons of enemy fighters. That said, you only have 20 of those per life, and once you run out the ship has nothing else going for it. It also can't fit into tight spaces due to its size and upright flight position, which on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Endurance bonus mission</a> can even cause you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByMistake">crash into a Death Star deflection tower right when the mission starts</a> if you don't immediately pull up.
</li><li> On the "lethal" side of this trope, we have the Buick. Yes, you heard that right, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">a Buick</a>. It's only available with cheat codes, but it sports the same cluster missiles as <em>Slave 1</em>, and unlike <em>Slave 1</em>, it has excellent speed and shielding (on par with the A-Wing and X-Wing, respectively), fairly decent blasters (they're mounted in the headlights), and a <em>tiny</em> hitbox which makes dodging a breeze. Its joke status is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> heavily by the developers, as part of the code to unlock it is "WHATTHE".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VectorThrust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VectorThrust">Vector Thrust</a></em> has the antique MiG-21 Fishbed family and its Chinese knockoff cousins. At first glance, it's horrendous â€” paper armor and a tiny ammo pool make the starting variants something of a joke. If players invest the time and effort into upgrading the aircraft, however, they'll be rewarded with modernised Fishbed-93s and the like, boasting high mobility and surprising stealthiness due to their small size â€” not to mention a very attractive arsenal of all-aspect and medium-range missiles that open up interesting avenues of air to air combat. Compared to the near-uselessness of early variants the a late-game Fishbed is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> that can hold its own in dogfights against aircraft like the Su-47 and F-22 (provided they don't get sneezed at.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WarThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/WarThunder">War Thunder</a></em>:
<ul><li> The ZIS-30, the USSR's first tank destroyer. Effectively a tractor with a big gun on the roof, it is so top heavy that it does a dramatic nose dive every time it brakes, has zero protection for the gunner and loader, and is slow. On the other hand, it has a 75mm gun when most players are using 45mm or lower, and it's possible to get in the bizarre situation where the complete lack of armor helps it, as almost all armor-piercing shells will just sail straight the vehicle (over-penetrate) without doing any damage.
</li><li> When it was first introduced, the USSR's flak truck had weird damage states due to having zero armor - almost every type of gun would over-penetrate and deal basically zero damage unless they hit its ammo cache - leading to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">effectively unkillable truck</a> which could do nothing but annoy other tanks by shooting their periscope and sometimes shooting their treads off. Careful aim, however, allowed them to cripple turret traverse mechanisms.
</li><li> The Ju-87D-5 Stuka is slow, climbs poorly, and doesnÂ’t have an exceptionally good payload. But it has 2 MG151/20 20mm Cannon mounted in the wings, generally considered to be one of the best aircraft guns in the game, and with 1000 rounds it has ammo to spare. Its large wings also allow it to turn very well, causing more than a handful of fighter pilots that mistake it for a free kill to themselves be eaten alive. And it also can carry an extra four cannons...
</li></ul><p></p></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X3: Terran Conflict</a></em> has the <em>Truelight Seeker</em>, a unique M6 corvette given as a reward during the Goner plot. On paper it's pretty mediocre, with only 400 MJ of shields, a top speed of 138 m/s, no turrets, average reactor power, and it's a larger target than the Argon Centaur it's based on. However, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FixedForwardFacingWeapon">spinal slots</a> can mount literally every gun in the game except the Impulse Ray Emitter, and some have turned it into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> by fitting it with Gauss cannons. This is a weapon usually mounted on capital ships, but the <em>Truelight Seeker</em> is <em>just</em> fast and agile enough to dogfight with it, and since it relies on ammunition rather than the ship's reactor it can hit far harder its size would suggest.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackyardSports">Backyard Sports</a></em>: Kimmy Eckman generally has the lowest stats of the backyard kids (in <em>Backyard Baseball</em>, she's a decent power hitter but a slow runner with so-so pitching and fielding abilities). If she's playing on her birthday (June 22nd) or at Eckman Acres, her stats get a major boost.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FootballManager">Football Manager</a>, there is a team named RGOUR Minsk, who play in the Fourth Division of Belarus, which is a league that the game does not actually allow to be played, requiring a mod to make them playable. They have a perfect 20 out of 20 for their training facilities, youth facilities and junior recruitment. To explain how big that is, Barcelona, one of the greatest teams in the world, with a long established academy that produces talent by the handful, only has 20, 20 and 19.
</li><li> <em>Mutant League Hockey</em> has two examples in roughly the same mold:
<ul><li> The Chilly Liars. Rated 2 Skulls on a scale of 0-5, their players are largely well below average, and Coach Wimpson is a comically scrawny, clueless loser. However, starting LW Skingros is one of the best players in the entire game. Getting the puck to Skingros is often pretty rough because the other players are so weak and slow, and on higher Death Rate levels it can be hard to keep him <em>alive</em>, but it pays off very well.
</li><li> The Slaycity Slayers are pretty similar: They have a 2-Skull rating and most of the roster is sub-par, but starting LW KT Slayer is perhaps <em>the</em> best player in the game. The Slayers' stats average out higher than the Liars, but their goalie lets more shots get through.

<ul><li> Commoners are pretty much <em>the</em> useless class, with horrendous Base Attack Bonus, Hit Dice, and skills, as well as no class features - they're meant to represent an untrained human from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungAges">Dung Ages</a>. However, they're also the only class capable of taking "Chicken-Infested", a somewhat obscure "flaw" from Dragon Magazine. The flaw (every time you draw an item, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RummageFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RummageFail">it has a 50% chance of being a live chicken</a>) is meant for comic relief, being from an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AprilFools">April Fools</a> issue. Players noticed that it's a free action to draw items from a spell component pouch, and since a free action can be done any number of times, a Commoner could produce any number of chickens in a single turn. Astute players can use the chickens to suffocate dungeons, fill canyons, swamp invading armies, provide an infinite food source, and make DMs rip their hair out (but really, if your DM allows Chicken-Infested in a serious campaign, they deserve whatever happens to them). Commoners can also qualify for the Survivor prestige class at level 1. Its only non-role play prerequisite is that you have to have your highest base save lower than your level (usually you start with at least one of the three base saves at two) and has exceedingly high defensive abilities. In the same list as the 'Chicken Infested' flaw you can find a flaw that causes enemies to arbitrarily attack the person with that flaw, which is also exclusive to commoners. Combining the two can potentially be quite potent... Assuming you can survive that first level.

</li><li> Another infamous Commoner build is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showsinglepost.php?p=7097263&amp;postcount=38">Bubs,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a halfling Commoner 3/Marshal 1. One of the Commoner class skills is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">Handle Animal</a> (to represent them taking care of farm animals), which, with enough investment, can allow the character to tame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs">dinosaurs</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">at 4th level</a>. Downplayed, though, in that Handle Animal is by no means a Commoner-exclusive skill, and many classes can do it - but with it, a Commoner can be surprisingly effective.
</li><li> Two other NPC classes, the Expert and Adept, are not to be underestimated either.
<ul><li> Experts are meant to represent noncombatants with specialized training, and to reflect this, they can have <em>any</em> 10 skills, which is potentially very useful when sourcebooks contain ways to make skill use lethal. In particular, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IaijutsuPractitioner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IaijutsuPractitioner">Iaijutsu Focus</a> can give them a solid damage option, Use Magic Device turns them into a knockoff caster, Tumble for mobility, Autohypnosis to become immune to fear and poison, Diplomacy, Sense Motive, and Intimidate to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">The Face</a>, and the same Handle Animal antics as Bubs. It has become something of a victim of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCreep">Power Creep</a>, as both the Savant and Factotum have <em>all</em> skills as class skills without needing to choose, while backing it up with actual features - but if you're playing an expert, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CherryTapping">you probably didn't care.</a>
</li><li> Adepts are intended as untrained low-powered casters, with an irritatingly slow progression, few spells per day, and no features aside from a familiar. But though their casting isn't much, their spell list is actually quite well-rounded, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Sleep, Baleful Polymorph, and Web</a> to end encounters, Mirror Image, Stoneskin, and Protection from Alignment for defense, Invisibility for stealth, Obscuring Mist, Wall of Fire and Wall of Stone for battlefield control, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimateDead">Animate Dead</a> for minions, a number of basic healing and blasting spells, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Polymorph</a>. In most places, they come in at the lower-middle Tier 4, by far the highest of the NPC classes and surpassing a handful of core classes. Adepts even have a special <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a> meant for them, the Hexer, which bumps up their Base Attack and gives them more spells and a nasty gaze attack (admittedly, Archivists and Shugenja can take it too).
</li></ul></li><li> A good way to spot the difference between beginners/noobs and experienced players is how they view the bard class in 3.5. Anyone who's in the former will dismiss bards as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoonyBard">spoony</a>, the latter will point out Dragonfire Inspiration + Words of Creation + a few Inspire Courage bonuses = +8D6 damage to attacks made by your party members at Level 6. To put that in perspective, the other major things at Level 6 are druids getting the ability to buff while in bear form and the melee classes finally getting a second attack (which always misses) and the mandatory Shock Trooper feat, none of these are as helpful to the party as an average +30 damage to each attack. Perhaps even more impressive (in the hands of a skilled player) are the noncombat abilities of the bard. As the only Core base class capable of using both spells and skills, a properly played bard can do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFace">with a few rolls</a> what would otherwise be difficult even with a large number of encounters. Another thing often missed is that players tend to dismiss its casting abilities because it only gets to 6th-level spells while the specialized casters get to 9th... but they're still 6th-level spells, in the edition that defined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LinearWarriorsQuadraticWizards">Linear Warriors, Quadratic Wizards</a>, which is more than enough to outpace any core class that isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryBreakerPower">a specialized caster</a> and end or trivialize whole encounters with one spell.
</li><li> The jester, introduced in <em>Dragon Magazine</em> and made proper with <em>Dragon Compendium</em>, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingClown">Fighting Clown</a> who looks like a worse bard at first glance. In fairness, this isn't far wrong - but more because, as mentioned, the bard is a lot better than it looks. It has a few baffling features (including armor proficiency but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorAndMagicDontMix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorAndMagicDontMix">no armored-mage feature</a>), and many of their abilities look worse than bardsong. But they have multiple useful save-or-lose tricks, they don't need to spend standard actions to buff their party members, and their spell list is surprisingly great, and includes some greatest-hits that the bard doesn't, including Alter Self and Polymorph.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZCIh_3b5K8">Abserd<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a Level 14 character who multiclassed into <em>every</em> base 5th Edition class once. Described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PuffinForest">his creator</a> as the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllTrades">Jack-of-All-Trades</a>, "an archer that can't shoot, a fighter that can't fight, a healer who can't heal and a wizard who can't cast spells". No Ability Score Increases either, but what he definitely has is a ton of cantrips and skill proficiencies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool">and surprisingly hard to kill to boot</a>.
</li><li> Kobolds are tiny lizard creatures with a base challenge rating of 1/4, and about that many hit points. <a class="urllink" href="http://1d4chan.org/index.php?title=Tucker%27s_Kobolds&amp;oldid=83432">Tucker's Kobolds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> became famous in D&amp;D fandom for being able to wipe fully-prepared Level 10 parties with nothing but clever tactics and items.
<div class="indent"> ...our party scrambled down a side passage, only to be ambushed by more kobolds firing with light crossbows through murder holes in the walls and ceilings. Kobolds with metal armor and shields flung Molotov cocktails at us from the other sides of huge piles of flaming debris, which other kobolds pushed ahead of their formation using long metal poles like broomsticks. There was no mistake about it. These kobolds were <em>bad</em>.
</div><ul><li> <em>Any</em> creature can become a heck of a lot more dangerous than their base challenge rating would seem to indicate with the help of clever tactics and items. What makes kobolds special is that they combine statistics and fluff that make it perfectly in-character to come up with and implement clever tactics with an extremely low challenge rating. Add to that a racial bonus to making traps...
</li><li> Kobolds can also take Dragonwrought and the Greater Draconic Rite, which, for the minor price of a feat, a gemstone, and some hit points, allows them to be treated as a dragon. This allows them to pull off a number of crazy tricks, including starting at Venerable age and taking no aging penalties for a +3 bonus to all mental stats, picking Epic feats, and getting all kinds of weird dragon-only abilities, such as Loredrake. And that's without accounting for the fact that it also gives you a +1 to your sorcerer level...
</li><li> There was also the module in <em>Dungeon</em> magazine, "The Bandits of Bunglewood", where the eponymous bandits were six kobolds who had gotten training from an experienced mercenary. Everyone they had ambushed and robbed were too embarrassed to admit they had been beaten by kobolds, and as a result, stories started to circulate about orcs, ogres, lycanthropes, and other "respectable" monsters.
</li><li> One of the most infamous builds in 3.5 was the "Pun-Pun" build, which was based on abusing various tricks at a very low level to gain Manipulate Formâ€”an ability associated with a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">Abusive Precursors</a> that created the reptiles of Toril, which allows the user to essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">give themselves every single ability in the game</a> when properly set up. As the ability specifies that one has to be reptilian to be affected by it, and kobolds are the most notable reptilian race to lack Level Adjustment, this made the weakest race in the game a potential path to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">divinity at level 1.</a>

It costs more to field than all but the very largest armies all by itself, and requires a scratch-built model about 4 feet high so it was obviously never intended to see actual play. <em>However:</em> It carries so many ludicrously powerful guns that it could conceivably kill its points cost in smaller <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> in one volley, while an army composed entirely of anti-tank guns could never hope to get through its shields before being wiped out itself. Its only weaknesses are close combat, which the <em>104</em> infantry it can transport can counter, and that it's so tall that many of its weapons can't hit targets less than three feet away.
</li><li> The joke army list <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">called</a> "Barrel of Monkeys". Basically, take Inquisitor Coteaz as a HQ, and build the whole army around <a class="urllink" href="http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Jokaero">Jokaero<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> troops, who are basically alien space orangutans. Jokaero aren't just simple monkeys; they're a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotSavant">Idiot Savants</a> who were likely created by ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a>, and they're capable of producing incredibly advanced weapons technology, in fact they're even more advanced than the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a></em> in some respects. Bring an army of Jokaero troops and your opponent will laugh at your fragile army of chimps, but you'll be the one laughing when he finds out that each Jokaero in the army is armed with a shiny little weapon ring which is the equivalent to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Lascannon</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Multi-Melta</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Heavy Flamer</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingArmory">note: "and" not "or"</a>). While it won't win any tournaments, it's still an incredibly fun and surprisingly potent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Glass Cannon</a> army list.
</li><li> Chaos Daemons in 6th Edition. It really plays to the idea of the fickle Chaos Gods: you can't even select wargear for your units, you have to buy a "chance" and then roll for it. The Warp Storm table, which activates every turn, has just as much chance to cripple your opponent's army as it does to yours, and the dice rolls don't scale in a linear fashion (you can get a great boon or a lethal handicap, they exist at both ends of the spectrum). Also, barring Tzeentchian daemons, they lack anything in the way of ranged firepower. However, with some incredibly powerful rules (if you can manage the rolls) and plenty of power weapons and invulnerable saves, along with the speed and immense close combat skill of the daemons themselves, they can be quite the force with a lot of skill and luck.
</li><li> The Green Tide formation was originally written off as a joke; you need a bare minimum of 101 models to play it and they must all merge as one unit, so it's incredibly hard to maneuver on the board. In addition, if the unit dies, it's worth a whopping <em>11 victory points</em>, which pretty much guarantees a loss. However, when people actually used it, they realized that this massive mob of boyz meant that <em>any</em> buffs brought in by a character was applied to every member of the squad at a cheap price. Painboyz essentially doubled the survival rate of the Boyz for pennies in points, and giving the Warboss a special relic that gave them fearless completely erased the Orks' sole weakness (their piss-poor leadership and Mob Rule). In addition, the 100 boyz made great buffering wounds for the Nobz and Warboss in the tide, making these already hardy units impossible to drop. The drawback of 11 victory points also only applies when the <em>entire</em> unit dies; so long as one Boy is still alive, you fork over <em>nothing</em>. Finally, every turn after the first, you can continually declare Waaagh, which solves the manouverability problem by basically allowing your boyz to run every single turn and still charge.
</li><li> When the drop pod was moved to the Fast Attack Slot in Space Marine Armies (and thus do not require you to buy an existing squad beforehand) it didn't take long for people to realize that you can field an entire army of these. While almost completely unable to harm anything (what with only having a storm bolter for armament), players soon realized that, because they're dirt cheap, you can buy enough drop pods to <em>wall off your opponent in their own deployment zone</em>. On top of that, Drop Pods count as scoring units now, so after walling off your opponent you can just drop one or two pods near an objective and start farming victory points while your opponent desperately tries to hack through the wall of pods.

Halflings have a miserably low movement rate, the lowest number of Wounds of all playable races <em>and</em> penalties to Toughness, Weapon Skill and Strength. Not what you'd build a warrior on? You'd be surprised. Halflings have a surprising number of warrior-type careers available, allowing them to compensate for their penalties quite quickly, and also get some nice Ballistic Skill bonuses. A halfling with a good crossbow will not be as cool as a Dwarf Shieldbreaker, but definitely hold their own in a fight. Oh, and halflings are the only race in the game completely immune to mutation, and can essentially juggle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">warpstone</a> with no ill effects.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you're fielding an <em>Urbanmech</em>, your opponents are going to laugh at you. It's puny, weakly armored and armed with an AC-10, which while formidiable, is still often outclassed by other 'Mechs. And worst of all, it's slow. 9 times out of 10, that is. Because that 10th time, you're probably using it in an urban environment where speed is not an issue, and it can duck under cover and snipe. And own most other 'mechs on the field not willing to punch through buildings to get it. It also received a variant equipped with ultra-long-range artillery missiles. Impressive and powerful, sure. Turns out that specific build can also pack <em>nuclear warheads.</em>
</li><li> The <em>Charger</em> CGR-1A1 has hilarious stats that makes any player think "why would you ever use this"; it's a 80 ton assault mech with the firepower of a 20 ton light mech. On the other hand, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">it moves as fast as a light mech while mounting the armor of a heavy mech</a>; it seems purpose build to get into opponents faces and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">start beating the crap out of them with its bare robot fists</a>. Retrofitted versions after the Clan Invasion mount devices like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Triple Strength Myomer</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NitroBoost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NitroBoost">MASC</a> allowing it to charge into combat at 100kph and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DynamicEntry">engage with a flying kick</a> then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnipingTheCockpit">Sniping the Cockpit</a>.
</li><li> The BNC-series <em>Banshee</em> was roundly mocked in the 3025 days, especially the 3-series versions. It's 95 tons and is loaded with armor and moves at the speed of a heavy 'Mech, but it lacks significant weapons other than its single PPC and autocannon, making it appear to be something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">Stone Wall</a>. However, its more interesting uses were similar to that of the above-noted <em>Charger</em>, in that it weighs 95 tons and <em>does 65 kph in a flat run</em>. A <em>Banshee</em> can cross 180 meters of open ground in ten seconds and shoulder-tackle opponents, dealing the equivalent of <em>four Gauss rifle shots</em> in damage. If this is somehow insufficient it can also start punching, dealing the equivalent damage to an AC-10 with every punch and having a solid chance to hit a Battlemech in the head. Turns out that heads have only 9 armor at maximum, and any time the internal structure beneath the armor takes damage, there is a chance of a component being destroyed...and the cockpit counts as a component. This makes the <em>Banshee</em> terrifically effective at pinning down other Assault 'Mechs and simply brutalizing them to death.
</li></ul></li><li> Sidereals in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2cou4');"><sup>*Â </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2cou4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2cou4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">most notably in the heavily errata'd "2.5th edition"</span> due to how unintuitive pretty much everything they can do is, especially compared to the straightforwardness of pretty much all the other Celestial Exalt types. The most durable ones don't wear armor, their main healing charm is in their Craft tree, and what is often considered the standard operating procedure charm for any other Celestial combat build is generally a bad idea for them (and that's just scratching the surface of their unintuitiveness). Sidereals have rather low raw dice and essence pools for being Exalts (the lowest in both of any Celestial), and have the lowest maximum health of any supernatural splat. They're also incredibly good at stacking the deck (which is part of their in-universe reputation and behavior as well), and many of their weaknesses are deceptive. They have the lowest maximum health, but have reasonably good soak, have access to regeneration and minimum damage reduction, the aforementioned healing charm in their Craft tree is likely <em>the single best healing charm in the game</em> in a system where combat-practical heals are both rare and expensive, and pack an enormous number of options that cripple the enemy's accuracy or outright cancel or redirect their attacks, even right back at the attacker. They have small essence pools compared to other Celestials, but with the right preparations, they have significantly <em>more</em> resources available than any other Exalt type when truly desperate (albeit not as something they can do all the time). Their raw dice pools are tiny, but they're also the only splat that's able to competently manipulate what number on the die is considered a success (and the usual Celestial combat standard operating procedure locks them out of using one of their two best tools for this), both for themselves and (with some effort) their enemies as well. This is all within their <em>native</em> charm set, without even touching upon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Sidereal Martial Arts</a>. Basically, if you play them straightforwardly like other Celestial Exalt types, they're going to be pretty weak. If played like the sideways-thinking deck-stackers they're portrayed as in-universe, a Sidereal becomes an absolute nightmare to fight.

<ul><li> Think that's all the Borot can do? In Alpha Gaiden, once his will was high, just plant him in water and have him fight beam using enemies. They do 10 damage, HE kicks their ass. Also, if you buff his defense and HP, you can actually turn the Borot into a highly viable meat shield in J and W.
</li><li> Alpha 2 takes it a step further, with Boss getting his copilots Nuke and Mucha. Unlike in J, they start out with a pair of decent-ish seishin each, until they hit level 80. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">At which point Nuke starts throwing Exhaust for 10 SP and Alert for 5.</a>
</li><li> Not only that, but in J and W, he can use a Self Destruct attack when you think he may be of no more use if he takes too much damage. Crank up the Spirit commands to max and watch the fireworks. And it only costs a measly 10 in cash to repair. Not only that, there is often a meme of him being the true hero of whatever game he is in with the Self Destruct attack his mech has.

This sounds pathetic at first glance; it's boosting a noncombat unit and it's not even boosting the thing that unit is supposed to be good at. But then you realize this means India's workers can now traverse difficult terrain without wasting their turns, form up into stacks more quickly, outrun non-cavalry enemy units, and move and start building on the same turn. And since it replaces the worker, it never goes obsolete, meaning it stays useful for the whole game.

It also has good View, so it can avoid being spotted too early by most units and use its advantages to the fullest. At High altitude it can fly with impunity over almost anyone, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiAir">Anti-Air</a> trooper.

Oh, and Zeppelins are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">cheap</a>. As is infantry.

At low levels, he's quite pathetic with his walking range being only 3 tiles, his attacks are silly looking plus his accuracy is pretty low, and his main specialty is to heal and he's not even that great at it so why is he here? Those silly attacks? They can easily <em>hurt an enemy stat gauge</em> from full to <em>almost nothing</em>, allowing him to follow up on Soul Sympathy attacks, or he could also be used to support Soul Sympathy attacks from other heroines. His healing skill is the only skill that gives him 10 exp (unless he's healing a higher leveled ally or enemy) consistently. And when he finally does gain those levels, he could easily go farther with his walking distance. With a lot of patience (and we're talking about a long time of healing, ending turn and rinse and repeat), he could easily get to level 99, then end the battle and pump up his bonus stats from all that leveling to his attack. Watch as enemies can't hit him thanks to his high dodge rate, and he could literally be your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>. Of course, training him for that long is an absurd amount of time invested.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamGGeneration">SD Gundam G Generation</a></em> franchise lets players put any character they want into any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mobile suit</a> they want, which means plenty of characters who are supporting cast members and/or non-combatants in their home series can be this trope. But the queen of them all (pun not intended) would probably have to be Relena Peacecraft from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>; because she's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> and political leader, her initial stats are all dismal except for her Leadership (which is usually the highest out of the entire <em>Wing</em> cast). However, her later-level stat gains are through the roof, meaning if you're willing to stick with her she can become a bona fide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Lady of War</a>. This actually makes Relena many players' preferred choice for power-leveling a new mobile suit, since she can more than cover for a starting MS's low stats.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantomBrave">Phantom Brave</a></em>, Marona is only really intended as a summoner for the more potent phantom combatants, and has weak stats and poor combat skills, aside from an affinity for healing and status magic. However, she does have the significant advantage of never leaving the field (every other phantom returns home after a number of turns), and a properly fusioned weapon can give her godlike stats. Further, there are weapons that utilize healing-based, damage-dealing attacks, such as vases. It's perfectly feasible to turn Marona into a one-girl army.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MakaiKingdom">Makai Kingdom</a></em>, healers are largely worthless because their dependency on Resistance (which is the stat healing uses to determine effectiveness) means they can't fight effectively. Furthermore, once you get into the midgame, healing falls into disuse as a tactic in favor of just defeating enemies as fast as possible. Enter the syringe, a rare weapon you can't buy in the store... which not only can heal for free, but has <em>damaging</em> attacks, that are based on Resistance to boot! While absolutely no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> (at this point, you'll likely have much more powerful damage dealers), the fact that they have all their ability based on one single stat makes them very efficient, as well as finally relevant again.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FateGrandOrder">Fate/Grand Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sasaki Koujirou, a 1-star assassin, has very low stats, and during the first singularity, he's not very useful due to the fact that the class he has an advantage over (Rider) isn't present. Then along comes Orleans, the second singularity, with a large amount of Rider-class dragons; his low cost, as well as how easy it was to ascend/max out his skills, led many players to use him as opposed to Siegfried<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8grtr');"><sup>noteÂ </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8grtr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8grtr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the latter being what the developers had intended, due to his skillset and noble phantasm being anti-dragon</span>, and the introduction of Palingenesis made him even more useful later on. Because of this, Kojiro became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Memetic Badass</a> as the Savior of France and "the LEGEND" (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Engrish">"REGEND"</a> as it was spelled before it was corrected).
</li><li> Mata Hari has abysmal stats, no passive skills, and mediocre active ones. However, she qualifies as this for 2 reasons: during the GUDA GUDA crossover event, she's an enemy servant at a <em>ridiculously</em> high level, and her noble phantasm always paralyzes enemy servants (especially male ones). The second one is that due to her class, Assassin, and third skill (which seals skills), she's actually a very good choice against <em>the final boss</em>, since not only can she stop the boss from using one of his strongest skill combos, but as an Assassin, she gets bonus damage against him.
</li><li> Angra Mainyu has terrible stats (even being the only <em>0-star</em> servant), and his Noble Phantasm requires him to take damage to work (and it has to be enough damage to decimate his opponents, meaning that if they don't do very much, or they use skills, it's useless). However, against enemies that have massive damage buffs (most prominently in the Chaldea Summer re-run Challenge Quest), he's <em>very</em> useful, due to his Noble Phantasm ignoring buffs. And when fought as a boss? Well... hope that you can beat him before he gets a chance to use his Noble Phantasm, or if he does use it, hope that you either have Guts or don't deal enough damage for the damage he deals to decimate you.
</li><li> In sharp contrast to Lancer Cu Chulainn dying in every route of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> and being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CarnivalPhantasm">Carnival Phantasm</a></em>, he rules the low-cost metagame in <em>Grand Order</em> specifically for his amazing survival skills. With an auto-revive, a three-hit Evade, and a debuff removal/heal, he can tank a lot of punishment.
</li><li> Arash is a 1-star Servant with weak stats, an ability which boosts his critical star generation rate despite being barely able to generate any, and a Noble Phantasm that kills him after use. As such, initially, most people regarded him as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">Joke Character</a>. Later buffs, however, moved him into this trope: he got a new skill that increases his HP and NP regeneration, his Phantasm was made into an incredibly powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AreaOfEffect">Area of Effect</a> blast, and the Palingenesis system gives the player the chance to make him stronger. As such, Arash now has a niche as a cheap nuker who goes in first and uses Stella to clear the field for the heavy hitters of his team.
</li><li> The success of Arash led to a similar Servant, Chen Gong. His stats are barely better than Arash's, his skills look mostly like weird, situational buffs (one mostly only works on Berserkers, and provides a buff to crits when Berserkers rarely ever crit), and his Noble Phantasm, while highly damaging, kills the leftmost person in the party who isn't himâ€”meaning that using it wrong will kill a more valuable character. Savvy players quickly recognized that this meant you could sacrifice a Servant whose skills are on cooldown and whose NP is at low charge, letting a fresh Servant from the back row take their place and come in swinging. Additionally, while his buffs are situational, they also enable many bizarre tricks, like forcing enemies to target characters with invincibility, or pulling off absurd damage numbers with crit-based Berserkers like Lu Bu. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_-DK3RrALY">Particularly absurd builds<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> combine Chen Gong with various Servants with charge skillsâ€”each time he kills one of his allies, another one steps in and drops all their buffs on Chen Gong, letting him charge again, and then he fires off his NP again, taking down the enemy wave and killing his ally again, letting him repeat the process by turning his allies into ammo and burning through waves in no time flat. (You should probably realize by now that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">he's a bit of a jerk.</a>)
</li><li> Paul Bunyan is a character from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LearningWithMangaFGO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LearningWithMangaFGO">comedy manga</a> with a chibi design, whose own background acknowledges her pointless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flip</a>, and her survivability is awful even for a one-star (she has <em>the</em> lowest HP in the game, and as a Berserker, takes effective damage from almost everything). But she's incredibly cheap to upgrade and use, all her skills are useful party buff abilities, and she has an extremely short Noble Phantasm animation (which also hits all enemies, and as a Berserker, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">extremely likely to do good damage despite her bad stats</a>). This makes her one of the best farming characters in the game: drop all her skills on the first turn, use her Noble Phantasm to wipe out the entire first wave of enemies, and when an enemy drops her, bring in one of your powerhouses because Bunyan's cost is borderline nonexistent.
</li><li> Jason is also a one-star, and he's even more obviously a joke than the others: not only is he the only Saber below three stars, but his stats are terrible and most of his animations consist of him calling out his friends to do the attacking (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithFriendsLikeThese">he usually gets caught in the crossfire</a>). Even his Noble Phantasm has him getting turned into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleInTheSky">Twinkle In The Sky</a> by Heracles. However, all of his skills are supportive, and they're pretty strong on the whole. Not only that, but his third skill boosts in power significantly when buffing Argonaut teammates, which includes some very powerful choices, like the aforementioned Heracles. But what wraps his kit together is the aforementioned NP, which hits multiple times, is an Arts-type, meaning it charges itself on hit, and each use of it boosts his Arts cards, including itself. This means that with proper team support (i.e. Paracelsus and someone with another Arts boost), Jason can outright loop his Noble Phantasm, using the hits from one to charge up another almost instantly, and tearing through weak enemy waves with speed that feels almost unreasonable for such a low-cost Servant.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> games are practically designed around allowing joke characters to turn into total badasses, provided that you can stand to level them up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Magikarp Power</a> is common throughout the series, and units that start out weak tend to have good growths to make up for it.
<ul><li> Tina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em>, when looking at her statline, seems to offer absolutely nothing. She has the worst staff rank of any of the game's healers, is as durable as a wet paper towel, and boasts a miserable 1 Skill with a 20% growth, in a game where low Skill on a staff unit can cause their staves to <em>miss</em>â€”Tina's Skill being so bad she misses about a third of the time at base level. While she does have five movement stars, giving her a chance to act twice, this mostly just compensates a little for her missing. At this point, you have multiple characters who can use strong staves, making a character who struggles with basic healing very undesirable. Her only standout point is two personal staves, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooAwesomeToUse">can only be used a combined total of seven times...</a> and they're all she needs. While the Unlock Staff's ability to open any door or chest from anywhere is already highly useful in some maps, the Thief Staff is the real appealâ€”it lets Tina <em>steal the held item of any enemy with lower Magic than her.</em> Even at base level, this is enough to casually steal from any non-magic-using boss, and a few levels or a magic-boosting Pure Water will solve that handily. Its four uses can be quickly inflated by her sister's Repair Staff, making it fairly easy to use whenever you see something you want. Additionally, Tina's habit of missing actually becomes a <em>good</em> thing, since she still gets XP for using a staff and doesn't consume a use, and her personal staves give a lot of XP, meaning you can train her up very easily. And once she's raised her staff rank and promoted, her five movement stars means she gets two turns fairly regularlyâ€”and this is around the point that the really broken staves start showing up, which she can now use, making her one of the most versatile characters in the endgame.
</li><li> An unusual example of this is the shaman Knoll, of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a>.</em> He joins fairly late in the game, wielding the worst magic type, with stats that would have been unimpressive if he showed up five chapters earlier (including a rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">0 Luck</a>) and growths that aren't going to save them. The guy is so depressed and pessimistic about his lot in life that when you first try to rescue him, he just assumes his execution date has been moved up. But what makes Knoll unique is that he is just high-level enough to be promoted from shaman to summoner without any grinding neededâ€”and as a summoner, he gains healing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMinionMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMinionMaster">the ability to spawn a phantom every turn.</a> Said phantoms enable all kinds of oddball strategies, because not only can they chip at enemies and traverse most terrain types, but their nonexistent durability means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIBreaker">that enemies preferentially target them</a>. This is especially useful when much of the endgame is full of enemies spamming the powerful and long-range Shadowshot spellâ€”every shot wasted on killing a phantom makes your other units that much safer. Knoll even tends to see use in <em>speedruns</em>, just because he presents such a unique utility.
</li><li> Due to the introduction of "Battle Experience", <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Path of Radiance</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Radiant Dawn</a></em> are especially guilty. The former has Makalov, who has pink clown hair, orange armor, and is best described as an all-around doofus. Oh, and he also enters the game badly under-leveled. With some TLC, though, Makalov's great growths can make him into one of your best Paladins.
<ul><li> Mist is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Ike</a> and enters the game badly underleveled while dressed in what can only be described as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorFuku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SailorFuku">sailor suit</a> (in what is supposed to be a western fantasy setting). She is notable in the game for having some of the lowest strength growths and stat caps in the game while also having an amazing magic growth and stat cap. Unfortunately she uses swords as a weapon of choice, which makes her mediocre in battle at best. Until you give her one of the magic swords available in the game, which uses her magic stat for attacking and behaves pretty much like a magic tome. All of the sudden, you have a beastly unit capable of destroying anything... at least until her magic sword breaks.
</li><li> This is only possible in <em>Path of Radiance</em>, however. In <em>Radiant Dawn</em>, magic swords do physical damage now. This makes Mist far less usable as an attacker, but allows for more than three sword users (one of whom isn't even in <em>Radiant Dawn</em>) to be able to effectively attack from afar, since every other sword user relies a lot more on the strength stat than the magic stat.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Radiant Dawn</em>, Meg seems designed as this. She's low-leveled and rather weak, and seems to exist as a punchline to a dialog in the previous game. However, she also has surprisingly high Speed, Resistance, and Luck growths for an armor unit, and her skill Fortune makes her immune to criticals. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower">Fully maxed-out</a>, she becomes one of the best armor units around... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">unfortunately</a>, <em>Radiant Dawn</em> is a game where you <em>really</em> don't want to go through the trouble of babying a weak unit, high growths don't mean much when they quickly slam into low stat caps, and fellow armor knight Gatrie (who shows up a bit later) is usable out of the box and has comparable Speed, Resistance, and Luck to even a Meg that has been levelled properly.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Nintendo Wars</a></em> has Sami, Colin and Sensei, three COs that are considered among the most broken in the series despite not seeming like it at first glance.
<ul><li> Sami's only strong units are foot-soldiers, and all her land vehicles are weaker. However, since her best units are the cheapest in the game, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">easily spammable</a>, and foot-soldiers are among the most important units due to their ability to capture buildings to generate more income. Sami's happen to get a 1.5x bonus to capturing as well, which lets her easily get an economic lead over her opponents. (For perspective, you normally only need to do 1 damage to an Infantry unit to prevent a two-turn capture. For Sami's, you need to nearly wipe it out) Her strong Mechs have favourable matchups against all light vehicles for less than half their price, and in numbers can even overwhelm Medium Tanks. And only her <em>direct</em> combat vehicles are weaker, and Indirect units happen to be both overpowered and a great support for Mech-spam.
</li><li> Colin's gimmick is simple: all his units are 20% cheaper, but have 20% less firepower. You'd think that would just encourage flooding the enemy with weak cannon fodder... until you realise his units aren't any worse <em>defensively</em>, making Colin's lines incredibly hard to break through. And low firepower doesn't matter when you can get Md Tanks and Bombers when your opponent is struggling to get out regular Tanks. Colin gets even better due to his Normal CO Power, Gold Rush. It's cheap and easily spammable and multiplies his cash on hand by 1.5, making all the above advantages even better.
</li><li> Sensei has a strange set of specialities. Being a former paratrooper, he has strong Infantry and helicopters... and almost all his other units weak. This might look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a> at first, but his Infantry and Mechs have all the advantages of Sami's above (minus the capturing), and Battle Copters are one of the most versatile attack units in the game while being just cheap enough to be spammable. They're countered by Anti-Air units but Sensei's Mechs can cover those. His CO Powers have the unique effect of spawning free Infantry or Mechs in all cities he controls, which lets him easily overwhelm opponents and save money, and them starting with 9/10 HP is actually an advantage as it lets him generate even <em>more</em> money by Joining them. Sensei is even this in-universe, as his first Campaign mission has his opponent laughing at being faced by a senile old man... and Sensei quickly quickly shows him exactly why he's a legendary war veteran.

However, if the player is smart enough to avoid battles for the first few turns and prioritize on healing, when the Shifu Robot recovers all of its HP, it becomes a genuine threat to be reckoned with. It can still pick up stars from bonus panels (unlike the Store Manager) and actively participate in battles (unlike the Flying Castle).

What it DOES have going for it, however, is that it's one of the flattest bots in the middleweight division, meaning enemy attacks go either right over it or just barely graze it, and it has a unique tool, a sliding bar that travels across the middle of its H-shaped frame. True to its name, this bar is meant to trap opponents by hugging them, and once caught, it is very difficult to escape from, during which Huggy Bear will carry its opponent to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">Pulverizer hammer</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSpinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSpinning">the Killsaws</a> on the stage and stack up damage while the opponent cannot do anything. It is also very hard to flank: Its operator will bring it to the center of the arena, then have it sit there always facing the opponent waiting for them to approach, allowing it to overcome faster, more maneuverable opponents like Sabotage.
</li><li> Wrecks is the absolute slowest bot in the ABC revival, only able to slowly hobble its way along and takes a minute to just move a few feet. It was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomped</a> in every tournament match it was inâ€”then the 2016 rumble consisting of the previous year's returning bots took place, where Wrecks's giant flywheel sawblade demonstrated its absurd power, defeating 3rd seed Witch Doctor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">in one hit</a>. It was curb-stomped by Bite Force later, but this one event was so unexpected to everyone (perhaps except to the people who built and operate Wrecks) that it elicited gasps and screams from the audience.
</li><li> A series filled with buzz-saws, crushing hammers, and the occasional <em>flamethrower</em>, has the bot known as DUCK! Compared to other bots, DUCK! is bland and silly. A box on wheels with a duck theme and a tiny wedge. But as several of the more lethal bots found out, DUCK! was just as lethal as he was silly. Especially due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">utter invincibility</a>. This came into play big-time against reigning champ Tombstone. Who was brought within 2 seconds of a count-out by the bot.
</li><li> When you see Chomp out in the BattleBox, wildly swinging its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DropTheHammer">pointed hammer</a> around and tipping itself on its side again and again, losing most of its matches, you may think it's a bunch of useless garbage. Said "useless garbage," however, defeated the reigning champion Bite Force, doing so by pecking into a tiny hole, with ludicrous precision, that broke Bite Force's weapon and messed with its movement. So far, Chomp remains the only robot to have won against Bite Force.
</li></ul></li><li> Jinkx Monsoon from Season 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace">RuPaul's Drag Race</a></em>. For the first several episodes, she was written off by the other contestants as a corny comedy queen with an old-timey gimmick, and she kind of faded to the background...until the celebrity impersonation episode in which her hilarious performance as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreyGardens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GreyGardens">Little Edie Beale</a> earned Jinkx her first win of the season. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">That's when the other queens realized</a> that Jinkx was a threat after all. Sure enough, she not only won the season, but became a fan favorite due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkhorse">the underdog</a>.

<ul><li> Paris from Greek mythology. A useless Pretty-boy who nobody liked for starting the 10-year Trojan war, Paris was exclusively a bowman (who were considered to be cowards in Greek society), who is repeatedly shown in the Iliad to be incapable of hitting headshots. Any time he goes for a kill he misses and hits the target in the foot. He's one of the oldest Joke Characters in history. Eventually when he goes for a sick headshot on Achilles, who, depending on the writer is nigh invulnerable/immortal, he misses and hits him where he hits with every other headshot he misses: in the foot. Which is Achilles's only weakness. Once more for those in the cheap seats. THE MOST OP DEMIGOD OF ALL TIME GOT KILLED BY THE JOKE CHARACTER.

<ul><li> There are several examples in baseball.
<ul><li> The knuckleball. A pitch so odd that anyone who looks to use it pretty much has to dedicate themselves to perfecting it, and it can take years to get it right. Most pitchers try to get batters out with blazing speed (typically 90+ mph at the highest levels), pinpoint control, and/or pitches that break so much batters can't even foul them off. The knuckleball ignores all these: it is thrown with a speed somewhere between 50 mph and 70 mph with little to no spin. The end result is a ball which wobbles in flight, going in random directions which <em>nobody</em> can truly predict. So, in short: no speed and no control. If it <em>doesn't</em> move, it's a batting practice pitch that will shortly wind up leaving the park. When it does move, it makes the opposing team look like rank amateurs as they flail wildly at the slow-moving ball. Knuckleballers also tend to have more precise daily regimens because the pitch's mechanics are so unusual: they have to manicure their nails much more precisely than other pitchers and even a hangnail can force them to miss a start; on the other hand, since the ball isn't thrown with any real force knuckleball pitchers can wind up with lengthy careers.
</li><li> Sidearm pitchers: The arm motion is completely different from standard throws - meaning that anyone attempting to use it is going into an area that most coaches are ill-prepared to handle. Because of the pitch going left-to-right (or right-to-left, depending on the throwing arm) rather than up-to-down, an error which would, in normal pitches, merely ground the ball can instead fling it into the stands. And since it looks different to a normal pitch, it can be considered... not laughable, but a novelty. Once conquered, though, a sidearm throw becomes a natural curve ball - even before any type of spin is put onto it. Combine that with batters unaccustomed to the form, and novelty becomes challenge.
</li><li> Submarine pitchers: Sidearm pitching not funny enough? Try rotating your body another 90Â°. Submariners risk scraping their knuckles on the ground; they sacrifice quite a bit of velocity compared to sidearmersÂ—never mind conventional pitchersÂ—but everything beneficial that applies to sidearmers, applies to submariners, too, just more so.
</li></ul></li><li> US Navy blimps in WWII. While a giant bag of helium might seem nothing to be afraid of (especially if you've got a hat-pin, or something similar) they did outstanding service as convoy escorts. Their slow speed let them dawdle right along with the freighters, while fixed-wing aircraft would have to fly in constant circles and eventually leave to refuel. Their high vantage point and later radar upgrades let them quickly spot enemy subs, which would then learn these shiny balloons were well equipped with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">machine guns</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathFromAbove">depth charges</a>. Out of all convoys escorted by blimps through the war, only a single ship was lost to the enemy.
</li><li> The U.S. Airforce's A-10 "Warthog" is probably the ugliest plane ever to successfully take off from the ground and land. It's not particularly fast, nor agile, nor graceful plane in the sky and by all rights, any fighter jet and ground anti-air systems would have an easy time lining it up to shoot. It was built to do two things: kill tanks, and tank kills. The former is thanks to the gun it's built around, which fires depleted uranium shells capable of ripping apart enemy tanks (or just about damn near any enemy anything). The later is because it's so ugly and deadly, Death himself fears to approach the damn thing. The plane has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">survived being riddled with bullets, missing an engine, missing its entire tail, missing up to 20% of its total wing span, and congressional budget cuts.</a> And it's a quick repair to get it to flying condition. When the Timex Watches said they "take a lickin' but keep on tickin'" the A-10 said "Hold my Beer!"
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otamatone">otamatone<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an instrument designed to look like an eighth-note from sheet music with a goofy face on the head, whose mouth opens and closes when the instrument is played. Its silly appearance and sound mean that it's often played for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> on YouTube, but get the right hands to play the right song and <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/a94bnWr9C1o?t=34s">you won't know whether you're laughing or crying any more<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> In the world of fighting the embodiment of this trope was Eric "Butterbean" Esch, an overweight, short armed boxer with a very unrefined style, very little footwork and the proven capability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">knock out pretty much anyone if he landed a single good punch</a>, Esch went on to make a prolific career out of knocking out opponents that looked much more fit than him.
</li><li> In LARP communities there is in nearly any group the "Skinny Fast Kid". Usually aged about 16 to 25, very slight build and looks like anybody would roll over them. And indeed normally anybody could take them out, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">if only they could catch them</a>. There is one famous story about a Russian LARP group who had a rule: players with no armour have 1 HP, each piece of armour that gives real life protection confers +1 HP, and so historically accurate plate armour gives a lot of HP. One team had to run a message to an allied camp a few kilometers away through enemy territory, on a hot summer's day. Enter the Skinny Fast Kid who decides to take no weapons and wear only a pair of swimming trunks. Nobody managed to catch him.
</li><li> Done by the Royal Italian Navy during both World Wars:
<ul><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, there was the MAS boat-that is, a largish motorboat made of <em>wood</em> and armed with a machine gun and two torpedoes. They terrified the Austro-Hungarian navy with their proven ability to penetrate any harbor but the extremely well-guarded Pula and fire torpedoes (and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakar_mockery">in one occasion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">they even left mocking leaflets in bottles</a> to try and bait the ships there into an ambush from two submersibles) and sank the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS_Szent_Istv&lt;!--C3--&gt;A1n">Austro-Hungarian flagship<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, they had the MT, <em>Motoscafo da Turismo</em>, translating as "Tourist Motorboat". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">They were basic one-man wooden motorboats of the kind usually rented to tourists in Italy's coastal cities</a> with some modifications-namely, engines that allowed the boat to quickly reach high speed (31.5 knots for the MTM type) and a large <em>explosive warhead</em>, the intent being to have the pilot set a course against an enemy ship, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">jump out</a>, have the boat ram the target, sink, and then explode underwater and open a hole under the waterline. While not as terrifying as the MAS boats had been in their day, the MT boats obtained some success during the entire course of the war and even <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_sloop_El_Amir_Farouq">as late as 1948<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
