</p><p>Many shows and movies don't bother getting a foreign language right when they portray them. The incidence of this increases along with the obscurity of the language.
</p><p>It is easily explained away as native speakers are hard to get, especially if the country of origin is on the other side of the globe and the language is fairly obscure. Even if you finally get one, he might not be so helpful if he has a poor knowledge about the aspects of his own language that the work specifically needs to use. Or simply he's a poor actor or a poor choice for the role (while non-native actors won't be able to correctly pronounce phrases in a language they don't speak). And that's assuming there even still <em>are</em> any native speakers.
</p><p>But first and foremost, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">if the intended audience won't be able to tell the difference anyway</a>, why bother? A somewhat more redeeming justification is that the show isn't supposed or expected to accurately portray a real-life language.

</p><p>Names appear especially hard to get right, even European ones, which is all the stranger as most American naming conventions haven't ventured far from their origin. This is why we see female Russians with masculine surnames and patronymics used as names or surnames, or why most French characters in comedic works tend to have a name composed of an English word preceded by a random "Le" or "La". This could be explained if their name was anglicized, though the practice has fallen out of favor in recent decades.
</p><p>This tends to be even more common in Eastern works, where writers usually tend to have even less experience with other cultures, leading to results that would seem more at home in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordOfTheRings">Middle-Earth</a> than any existing place on Earth.

But in the end, we rarely care, because the storytelling works for us.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says that most of his films are set in an alternate version of Europe, one in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> never happened. Except <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PorcoRosso" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PorcoRosso">Porco Rosso</a></em>, which is explicitly set on the Adriatic coast of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties">mid-20s</a> Italy, and whose protagonist Marco Paggot is named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Miya-sensei</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> Italian friend, who's also a pilot (but obviously not a pig).
</li></ul></li><li> The creator of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, in response to a fan question, gave suggestions as to what the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NationsAsPeople">Nations as People</a> would be named if they were human, and the fanbase has since run with them. However, many of the names fall squarely into this. Austria has a Jewish last name despite being presumably Catholic (Edelstein), Hungarys name is listed as (probably, going by Romanization) Elizebeta even though the Hungarian version of Elizabeth is Erzsébet, Greeces name literally translates to <em>Herakles Watermelon</em>, one of Belgiums suggested French names (Henri) is masculine (though Anri, a name derived from it, is a feminine name in Japan), Egypt for whatever reason is named Gupta, a Hindu name <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabBeobleTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArabBeobleTalk">he wouldnt even be able to pronounce</a> (though his middle and last name, Mohammed Hassan, just happen to be accurate), and the list goes on and on. Then there are weird mix-ups of surnames and first names like Sweden being named Berwald or Turkey having Adnan as his surname, despite the fact that Adanir is a real Turkish surname. On occasion, diminutives seem to be used instead of the actual names they would be diminutives of, like Ukraine getting Irunya or Switzerland Basch (often misspelled as Vash by early fans, which is an even bigger example of this trope) as opposed to Iryna and Sebastian. The most egregious cases, however, have to be the main character himself and his brother: Italys name is Feliciano Vargas, a rare last name used as a first name and a Spanish last name, and South Italys name is Lavino, a name which doesnt even exist (though possibly a corruption of the rare Italian name Lavinio). English-language Fanon name alteration attempts are not uncommon for this reason. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AerithAndBob">there are also plenty of characters who were given perfectly plausible, if at times old-fashioned, names</a>, which makes the bizarre names stand out even more (granted, Japan was given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMcCoolname">Awesome Mc Coolname</a> Kiku Honda, Kiku being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">usually a feminine name</a>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>: Although the English used by the paramilitaries in the action movie episode is grammatically perfect, it's apparently delivered by actors who haven't a clue what the words are intended to mean (and only the vaguest grasp of English pronunciation). This is deliberate parody of the trope - the Japanese subtitles (which the English subs of the scene follow) are far more eloquent, often to the point where they have very little to do with what is spoken. It's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in the English dub. Originally, when the soldier asks her "What is your purpose?" in a really strong Japanese accent, Excel just responds "I don't know." In the dub, she says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">"A big fish?"</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA">Aria</a></em>: Singer Eri Kawai admitted that a lot of songs have nonsensical lyrics, in an attempt to make them sound vaguely Italian. One song, a canzone sung by Alice during her graduation ceremony, has some verses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage">Esperanto</a>, likely to achieve the same effect without becoming too silly.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a></em> OVA has the song "Almateria", and while it has some significant words thrown in here and there, it's mostly pleasant-sounding gibberish.
</li><li> Done to a ridiculous degree in episode 52 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> where "Italian" ranges from reciting Italian foods to saying anime/manga related references with bad pseudo-Italian accents. Considering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">nature of the show</a>, this trope was almost certainly done deliberately.
</li><li> There are panels from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em> of Lum's mom speaking in Mah-Jong tiles that combined with her Chinese-style dress (implies "As Long As It Looks Chinese") and a French lady speaking in... <em>interesting</em> picture combinations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>. And early in the manga, where French and Chinese commentators on Ataru's game of tag with Lum spoke in, respectively, inane phrasebook style questions and Chinese food names.
</li><li> In the manga <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeaceMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeaceMaker">Peace Maker</a></em>, which is set in the American Southwest during the late 1800s (you know, a Western), a lot of the character names are... unlikely. The main character (who is male) is called Hope, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>'s name is Peace. At one point, they encounter an elderly woman named <em>Joshua</em>. The series is otherwise enjoyable, but it's apparent that the mangaka didn't know what names were for what.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:
<ul><li> Sharon Apple's pop song "Idol Talk" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus">Macross Plus</a></em> is completely untranslatable into French. The <em>words</em> are French, but the actual meaning is total gibberish. In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/YokoKanno">Yoko Kanno</a> has said that most of <em>Plus</em>'s songs were intentionally written to have lyrics that only <em>resemble</em> real languages, without actually being them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier">Macross Frontier</a></em>, the on-screen displays populated with English filler text use completely irrelevant excerpts from, for example, the Adobe Flash Player (or Adobe CS?) EULA and an article about the appearance of Oakley sunglasses in some bicycle or motorcycle event.
</li></ul></li><li> Similarly, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's</a></em> movie has a screen on-board the TSAB ship display text taken from a commercial web publishing site. It's obfuscated further by being mirrored (see-through screen seen from the back) and in the usual <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LyricalNanoha">Lyrical Nanoha</a></em> pseudo-runes script.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TimeOfEve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TimeOfEve">Time of Eve</a></em>, what are supposed to be a robot's error messages are actually from Microsoft Exchange Server.
</li><li> Much of Yoko Kanno's music from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> are in a pseudo-Frenchish language.
</li><li> Mostly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em>. The Dutch diplomats speak <em>actual Dutch</em> (a rarity in anime, where the Dutch are often treated as Germans with a different flag), and the American soldiers speak proper (if a tad simple and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCussWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCussWord">profanity-laden</a>) English. With that said, the Japan-obsessed leader of the Dutch diplomats has a non-Dutch surname (his name is"Isaac Kitching", although it may be justified as a way to distance the character from an <em>actual</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">Dutch diplomat from the rough time period</a>, "Isaac Titsingh"). Also, in-universe, Manzo's <em>very weak attempt</em> at infiltrating the American ship has him try to pass himself as American as speaking a mix between pseudo-English and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Japanese</a></em>. Again, justified since he is a Japanese official that does not know any English at all.
</li><li> Some of the non-Japanese characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ShamanKing">Shaman King</a></em>. The big standout would be Chocolove, an African-American shaman who joins the main cast in once the tournament begins. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">For obvious reasons</a>, the English dub and translations of the manga <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">change his name to "Joco"</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZatchBell">Zatch Bell!</a></em>, Kiyomaro is running "tests" on a stone tablet (petrified demon). After a while, he starts shouting random spells and demon names at it, since it has writing in the same foreign language as the spellbooks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. Many characters from the Britannian Empire, that is supposed to be an alternate-reality version of either UK or US, have ridiculously non-English names (such as Rivalz), even surnames as first names (Nunnally sounds like an Irish surname, Lelouch is a French one). On the other hand, there are some characters with quite acceptable names, such as Gilbert G.P. Guilford. And then there's Rolo, which could be a candy bar or a character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SanfordAndSon">Sanford and Son</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em>, or ''Fooly Cooly," was thus entitled because the meaningless phrase, according to the design staff, "sounded English." Likewise, character name "Atomsk" was chosen by the director because he saw it in English on a book cover (presumably <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomsk_(novel)">this one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and thought it looked cool.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em>'s Walter Dollneas has a surname consisting of two Welsh words that don't often appear together, let alone appear in a surname. Hirano has all but admitted that he had absolutely no idea what he was doing with the foreign names.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a case of Japanese-to-English, the author wanted realistic names that <em>sounded</em> American but didn't actually exist. The result is hit or miss. "Ray Penbar" sounds almost normal. "Knick Staek" and "Liab Zaopack" less so.
</li><li> Light's name is not a translation of <em>hikari</em> (光), the Japanese word for "light". The kanji for "Moon" (月) has the English word "light" as a possible pronunciation for it when used as a name.
<ul><li> "Possible pronunciation for a name" in Japan is "whatever you want to call your child", but using "月" to be pronounced "Light" is... unusual, to say the least. Apparently the author chose that name so that it wouldn't cause bullying of someone with the same name as the character.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the victims' names are examples of this trope, as was L, whose real name is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">L Lawliet</span>. In <em>Death Note 13: How to Read</em>, the writer of the manga admits that he made up the names of the victims randomly, so that no real names would show up as having been written down in the Death Note.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">Prequel</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AnotherNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AnotherNote">Another Note</a></em>, with names composed of random English words together, such as Beyond Birthday, Quarter Queen, and Bluesharp Babysplit.
</li></ul></li><li> Freesia Yagyu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JubeiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/JubeiChan">Jubei-chan</a> 2</em> is half-Japanese, half-Russian. Her first name, however, does not exist in either culture.
</li><li> Train Heartnet from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em> is one of the goofier examples of this trope.
</li><li> Rally Vincent from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunsmithCats">Gunsmith Cats</a></em>, although Rally is her nickname (her real name is Irene). In-story her name is intended to actually be <em>Larry</em> since she didn't think anyone would hire an obviously female bounty hunter, but due to the L/R confusion it would up translated as Rally, which still fit due to her fondness for cars.
<ul><li> Ditto <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Rally Dawson</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> - Expect characters to be given names like Jacuzzi Splot and board a train graciously named the <em>Flying Pussyfoot.</em>
<ul><li> "Claire Stanfield" is a perfectly normal woman's name. The problem is, Claire Stanfield is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBlenderName">man</a></em>. This one got lampshaded in the dub during an episode preview. In the thirties, when the series took place, that could be a man's name. The problem is that the masculine version of the name was spelled Clare.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PlawresSanshiro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PlawresSanshiro">Plawres Sanshiro</a></em>, the closing titles song ends with the lyrics "Craft Love", that make absolutely no sense either in the context of the song or indeed any context.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saiyuki">Saiyuki</a></em> gives the female name Hazel to a male priest... Slightly offset by the fact that he is rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a>, anyway. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said it was by combining the words "Beisun" (a type of alcohol) and "angel" and mucking with the pronunciation until you get "Heizeru." His full name is "Hazel Grouse," a type of bird, thematically linking him to Ukoku, who is heavily associated with crows.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Quincy techniques are German-influenced that either translate into nothing or are very bad uses of German words and grammar. For example, Seeleschneider, "soul-cutter/tailor", should be Seele<strong>n</strong>schneider. The Vandenreich's kanji mean "unseen empire". While "reich" is German, "vanden" or "wanden" doesn't seem to be an actual word. It might be a misreading of "vonden" ("of the") or an example of Kubo's musical obsession by being a nod to German metal band Vanden Plas (who themselves are car fans and named themselves after the Flemish coachbuilders that eventually gave their names to a Jaguar brand). Several members' names are similarly foreign sounding, and by far the most unusual has to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> BG9, (pronounced as the German "Be Ge Neun")</span>.
<ul><li> The Arrancar have Spanish-named zanpakuto, with a few strange exceptions, such as video game-exclusive Arturo Plateado having a zanpakuto named "Fenice" (not "Fénix" as has been erroneously claimed), which is Italian. Gantenbainne Mosqueda's zanpakuto, though, is named "Dragra", which doesn't seem to mean anything in any language. The Arrancar themselves have some curious vaguely European names, although several have been confirmed as deliberate misspellings based on real people.
</li><li> The Hollows have some reasonable variation names such as "Demi Hollow", "Huge Hollow", and "Menos Grande" (presumably broken Spanish for "big minus", but it literally means "less big"), but the names of the Menos stages, "Gillian", "Adjuchas", and "Vasto Lorde", just seem to be made-up words.
</li></ul></li><li> All of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> series are positively rife with foreign-ish names, some more successful than others. Might be justified because most of the series take place at an undetermined point in the future where Earth has become a One World Government and half of humanity lives in orbital colony superstructures. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">The one series</a> with a date solidly pinned down in relation to modern day does fairly well with the names.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GundamBuildFighters">Gundam Build Fighters</a></em> meanwhile takes place in the "real" world (albeit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>), and yet features an African-American character named Nils Nielsen. Unless he has some Scandinavian ancestry, the name comes off as kind of odd.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, Ami gives a student a printout of what she says is a NASA website. The printout is not gibberish. What it <em>is</em>, however, is the lyrics to "Danger Zone" from the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em>.
<ul><li> There are English-spoken phrases being a combination of English and Japanese or simply very grammatically incorrect. "Let's dancing" is actually rather common in Japan.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FafnerInTheAzureDeadAggressor">Fafner in the Azure: Dead Aggressor</a></em> has a supposedly Irish character named "Kanon Memphis", which doesn't sound like the sort of name <em>anyone</em> would have, let alone an Irish person.
<ul><li> It's actually spelled Canon and an in-universe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalThemeNaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalThemeNaming">Musical Theme Naming</a>. Memphis still goes unexplained, though.
</li></ul></li><li> Somewhat subverted in episode 10 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em>, where in-show foreigners Suzuki Sato and Tanaka Watanabe, both CIA agents, don't bother to check their Japanese aliases for simple things like using two surnames as a full name before entering the country. The Japanese officials with whom they interact are understandably befuddled upon seeing their calling cards. They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableTargets">obnoxious Americans</a> with their own sinister agenda and we're supposed to dislike them anyway. To add insult to injury, they look and act very much like some racist stereotypes of the Japanese, which is probably supposed to reflect their opinions of the country they've been assigned to.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>, spectacularly so with the "Portuguese" Tyki Mikk's name. There are at least 4 blatant errors in this name alone.
<ul><li> "Arystar Krory" was named after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleisterCrowley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AleisterCrowley">Aleister Crowley</a>, but the author deliberately went with a different spelling ("Alistair Crawley" could be a plausible substitute, though). There is also a Mexican man with the name "Winters Socalo", a German woman named "Miranda Lotto", two Chinese siblings named "Lenalee" and "Komui", and an American man named "Tup Dop". "Marie" is a man, and it seems that's his last name, meaning his first name is "<em>Noise</em>". A woman whose name was spelled "Crea" in the series itself has her name more correctly spelled "Claire" in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">data book</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyTwins">"Jasdevi"</a> are supposed to be American and while "Devitto" is apparently "David" mispronounced his brother "Jasdero" did not get so lucky.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em> has most of its characters with obviously Japanese given names, but because they all come from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Cultures</a>, a lot of their surnames are non-Japanese.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> is a repeated offender for its attempts at Italian names, most notably Bianchi is used as a (female) first name — it is actually a surname.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AuraBattlerDunbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AuraBattlerDunbine">Aura Battler Dunbine</a></em> has a classic example of this. A female character is introduced as "Marvel Frozen", to which the Japanese lead hero responds, "'Marvel Frozen'? You must be American!"
</li><li> In the Kyoto Arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSamurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidSamurai">Yahiko</a> come across three girls who say nothing but "chow" while gushing over a dog (an official Chinese translation just went with wingdings); he thinks to himself that they can't possibly be speaking Japanese. Considering the time period and that Yahiko, born and raised in Tokyo, is in Kyoto, it's probably a (rather well-known, actually) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansaiRegionalAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KansaiRegionalAccent">Kansai Regional Accent</a> joke. ("Chigau", a word meaning "that's wrong", gets shortened to "chau" in Kansai, and since the dog they're talking about is a Chow-Chow, Watsuki just had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">a little too much fun with it.</a>)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>, most of the English names of the American characters make sense, like Joshua and Rosette Christopher. But then you have the German character Satella Harvenheit (which <em>might</em> have been meant to be "Stella", but is officially spelled with the extra "A"), and the Portuguese immigrant Azmaria Hendrich...(although to be fair, her last name is her adoptive father's....but it still doesn't sound right).
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WeissKreuz">Weiß Kreuz</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakehitoKoyasu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TakehitoKoyasu">Takehito Koyasu</a> apparently picked the name because "Weiss" sounded cool, and "Kreuz" sounded cool with it. Randomly from a German dictionary. This was after the producers firmly vetoed his original title: "Cat People". In English. It really could have gone much worse.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoMewMew">Tokyo Mew Mew</a></em> anime, Ichigo meets an English speaking pianist and is only able to say a few English words, one of them being her own name translated, which is "strawberry". It can be especially amusing for native English speakers to listen to this supposed native English speaker speaking English with an extremely heavy Japanese accent, though this is fairly common for 'native English speakers' in Anime to sound nothing like an actual native English speaker since they hire Japanese voice actors who speak English about as well as many native English speakers speak Japanese.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZeroSevenGhost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ZeroSevenGhost">07-Ghost</a></em> is a series set in a European-style world. That explains the use of western words and names. Especially when the names in question arent actual names. Usually they are random German words, or just Gibberish. Combined with proper Japanese names. And in cases of in-universe terms, they probably just pick a word from a random language. One example would be the god of death, who is from some reason named Verloren which means lost in German. Or the terms Kor and bascule. Or the seven ghosts, who are called Zehel, Fest (means firm/firmly/feast in German), Profe, Randkalt (German again. Rand is edge and Kalt is cold, and therefore Randkalt means edge cold) , Rilect (maybe its supposed to be Relict), Ea, and Vertrag (contract in German).
<ul><li> And then there are the names Wahrheit Tiashe Raggs (Wahrheit means truth in German), Weldeschtein Krom Raggs (Krom means furthermore in Czech, but thats probably not what they meant. And Weldeschtein could be Waldstein which sounds enough like a German surname, or a rather believable Yiddish surname, though they probably werent meant to be Jewish with all the crosses around the place). Fea isnt a word, but it resembles a few real names. Female ones.
</li><li> And Frau. Okay, hes a womanizer, but is that really a reason to name him woman?!
</li></ul></li><li> Used for humorous effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GOnRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GOnRiders">G-On Riders</a></em>: two American street thugs speak entirely in random quotes from the Gettysburg Address. "Government!" "Of the people!"
</li><li> The one character of European racial stock on <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmellow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmellow">Ichigo Mashimaro</a></em>, Ana Coppola, is said to be from England despite having an obviously Italian surname, though it's not that rare for real Brits to have Italian surnames, to be fair.

</li><li> In <em>Mai The Psychic Girl</em>, one of Mai's enemies is the daughter of the East-German ambassador. Her name is Turm Garten — Tower Garden. In German, Tower is a male noun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Jackals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Jackals">Jackals</a></em> is set in America at the tail end of the 19th century. Its main protagonists are Nicole D. Heyward (a <em>Puerto Rican man</em>) and <em>Huya</em> Godfrey (a white guy). Some translations try to soften the blow by romanizing the first guy's name as "Nichol", but they're not fooling anyone. Also, his mother, who is actually from Puerto Rico, is <em>Lokishii</em> Heyward. The fan translation has tried to make <em>that</em> less ridiculous by changing it to "Roxy", but that's not quite what the kana spells out. And no, she's never been married.

The Decepticon Headmaster Juniors, for instance, are Bullhorn, Wilder, and Cancer — respectively Mexican, American, and Chinese. That said, since those names are bizarrely appropriate for their transtectors' altmodes (a hellish bull, a crazed wolf, and a sickening crab creature), they might simply be aliases — not that there's ever any indication of this being the case. Most of the other characters who hail from the west are only afforded, well, Transformer names like "Road King" and "Doubleclouder".

Barazaki demands to be called "Regina delle Farfalle" ("Queen of the Butterflies" in Italian), as she says she's Italian. Her pronunciation in the anime, however, is horrible, and she actually mangles "Regina dell<strong>a</strong> Farfall<strong>a</strong>", meaning "Queen of the Butterfly". Possibly intentional, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxreigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fauxreigner">she's actually Japanese and trying badly to pass herself as Italian</a> to maintain continuity with her older sister figure Mary Kikakujō, who is half-French.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> example: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RasAlGhul">Ra's Al-Ghul</a>'s daughter, Talia, uses the "surname" Al-Ghul, despite the Arabic patronymic not working that way, but kind of makes sense as her name would thus be "Talia, of the Demon". The trouble is that she then uses the "Anglicized" variant, "Talia <em>Head</em>", which translates the wrong word. Maybe "Talia Demon" wasn't subtle enough. (To be fair, Head is an actual surname, of Anglo-Saxon origin, and she was making very little effort to hide her identity or origins.)
</li><li> The time-displaced DC character Manitou Raven is said to be from the native American tribe that eventually became the Apache. Manitou (meaning "spirit") is actually an Algonquin word. For Europeans and others who may not know where the Apaches and Algonquins live relative to each other, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">this is about the equivalent of assuming a Norwegian word or myth can equate to a Georgian one</a>. Manitou Raven's power word for becoming a giant is the same as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends">Super Friends</a></em> character he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> for, Apache Chief: "Inukchuk". There <em>is</em> a word that is very similar to this, "inukshuk", which in its language means "something that substitutes for a human", and is applied to giant stone columns and statues. So it would <em>almost</em> be viable as a symbolic magic word, in the vein of "make me as big as an inukshuk", if it weren't for the fact the language in question is Inuktitut, an Inuit language. To carry on the example above, this would be like taking that Norwegian-Georgian mythological mix and throwing in a dash of Swahili. Then there's the fact that Inuit did not build giant stone columns or statues: inukshuks are only a few feet high. "Becoming as big as an inukshuk" would cause the average human to <em>shrink</em>.
</li><li> Hendy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Blackhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Blackhawk">Blackhawk</a> squadron is a nice example too, Hans is OK, Hendrickson is slightly un-Dutch, fitting a Dutch-American better than an unhyphenated Dutchman, "Hendricksen" is genuinely Dutch, but "Ritter" is the German word for "Knight", Dutch would be "Ridder", a title, not a name.
<ul><li> It gets so much worse with Polish characters. Janos Prohaska has a Hungarian first name and a Czech last name. And Stanislaus Drozdowski's first name isn't even real, sounding like some kind of mix between Belarusian Stanislau and Latvian Stanislavs. At least his last name is actually Polish.

<ul><li> The Cajun mutant, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gambit">Gambit</a>, likes to toss some French into his dialogue. He sometimes calls Rogue <em>"chéri"</em> (darling)... which would be nice if he weren't using the masculine form of the word. Luckily for our grammatically-challenged hero, there is no <em>audible</em> difference between <em>"chéri"</em> and <em>"chérie"</em>.
</li><li> Kurt (aka Nightcrawler)'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Gratuitous German</a> often gets misspelled so that he ends up calling girls "camisole" instead of the intended "sweetheart" or "darling" (<em>"<strong>Lieb</strong>chen"</em>).

</li><li> Blackwing (previously known as Beak) is a mutant who was said to be from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. His real name is Barnell Bohusk, which isn't much of a Dutch name at all.
</li><li> Sunpyre has the highly implausible first name of Leyu, which isn't even remotely Japanese. For one, there's no name in Japan that contains an "L". Second, even if romanticized to <em>Reyu</em>, it still doesn't fit at all. The closest thing that could come to this is "Rei" (an applicable Japanese name), which is still very far off from Leyu.
</li><li> Colossus' real name is Piotr Nikolayevitch Rasputin. Rasputin is a common surname in the area of Russia where he's from, which is fine. And the patronymic is correct, even better. Then his sister <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IllyanaRasputin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IllyanaRasputin">Illyana Rasputin</a> is introduced. Slight oops; her last name ought to be Rasputina. The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe eventually gives her full name as "Illyana Nikolaivitch Rasputina (Anglicized to Rasputin)", but even <em>that</em> isn't right — Nikolayevitch is a masculine middle name, translating as "son of Nikolai." Since Illyana's a girl, her middle name should be "Nikolayevna" (daughter of Nikolai). Eventually, about forty years after her introduction, this was corrected.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewMutants">New Mutants</a>' Roberto da Costa sometimes says sentences in Spanish... even though he came from Brazil, where the language is Portuguese. (His native language remains Portuguese, so it's not simply a case of speaking a minority language for his country.)
</li><li> Silver Samurai's real name is Kenuichio Harada. You won't find a single person in Japan called Kenuichio. In Japanese translations, his name is Kenichiro.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>'s birth name is said to be "En Sabah Nur", which is said to mean "The First One", hinting at the fact that he's one of the first documented mutants in history. Not only does "En Sabah Nur" not actually mean "The First One" (it roughly means "The Morning Light"), it's an <em>Arabic</em> phrase. Apocalypse was born in Egypt around 3,000 B.C., several millennia before the Arabic language existed.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Quicksilver">Quicksilver</a>, who hails from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">the fictional Eastern European country of Transia,</a> was born "Pietro Maximoff". While "Maximoff" is a real Eastern European surname (albeit a very rare one), the writers apparently missed the fact that "Pietro" is an <em>Italian</em> name, being the Italian variant of "Peter". The writers at least have the cop-out of his being from a fictional country, but most other characters from around there have names that fit geographically.
</li><li> Kwannon (better known as the original owner of Psylocke/Betsy Braddock's Asian body, now the main character of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FallenAngels2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FallenAngels2019">Fallen Angels (2019)</a> comic series, is this. Kwannon is the less common (the more common one being Kannon) Japanese version of Guan Yin, a Buddhist deity of mercy. This is a step up from some of the examples above in that it's at least a real word, but it still isn't something a parent would name their child.
</li></ul></li><li> Bushido from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has the civilian identity Ryuku Orsono. Ryuku (well, Ryukyu) is the name of a chain of islands, not a given name, while Orsono is simply not a real Japanese surname by any stretch and doesn't even kind of sound like one. The names of his weapons are also really poorly researched, but that's another matter.
</li><li> In-media example: In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em> album, the Daltons disguise as Chinese. Jack decides to make his disguise by speaking "Chinese". Which means that he says "ching chang chong" all the time. A crowning moment of funny is when he is talking to a Chinese man who dislikes Rin-Tin-Can very much:
<div class="indent"><strong>Averell:</strong> Ching chang chong.

In the fine tradition of cool Russian nicknames, however, "Natasha" is an acceptable nick for "Natalia". We still have to paper over "Romanoff/Romanov" as her Anglicizing her surname, but it's entirely plausible so it does not draw much attention.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FearItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/FearItself">Fear Itself</a></em> introduced Splitlip, a dwarf blacksmith whose speech is peppered with profanities, covered up by writing them in Norse runes. If you actually translate the runes, you will find out it's gibberish. Even the Asgardian version of the old Norse language probably does not have words like "eabrkmthw".

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>
<ul><li> In the classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">semi</a>-silent comedy, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ModernTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ModernTimes">Modern Times</a></em>, Charlie is expected to sing a song, but loses his cuffs that have the lyrics written on them. Desperate, Charlie improvises a song using gibberish that sounds like a mix of French and Italian and pantomimes a story as he sings. That product of his quick thinking brings the house down. Chaplin did this to keep his Tramp character international and not limited to a specific language.
</li><li> Chaplin's Hitler-like role in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatDictator">The Great Dictator</a></em> delivers a foaming-at-the-mouth speech in Tomanian, one of the funniest fake foreign languages ever: a pastiche mixture of English, German, and Yiddish nonsense in which such words as "Sauerkraut" and "Katzenjammer" recur. The film also has an Italian equivalent in a character parodying Mussolini.
</li></ul></li><li> Korean-American actor Philip Ahn, known for his many Asian character roles in films and TV shows from the 1930s all the way through the 1970s, was often called on to speak in his character's "native" language. Similar to many Native American actors at the time, he would just spout off some Korean with directors and co-stars none-the-wiser.
<ul><li> This actually helped boost his popularity in the Korean immigrant community (and in Korea proper), where audiences weren't used to hearing the Korean language on-screen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Gayniggers from Outer Space</em> has random high pitched noises substituting for the Chinese language.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeamAmericaWorldPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeamAmericaWorldPolice">Team America: World Police</a></em>, anything that wasn't English was nonsensical gibberish, apart from random French that amounted to the same thing. The terrorists, for example, only use three words: 'Durkadurka', 'Muhammed', and 'Jihad!' Except for the cries of "NO ME GUSTAAAA!" at the Panama canal and a North Korean pilot shouting "KAMSAHAMNIDA!".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LiveAndLetDie">Live and Let Die</a></em> is supposed to happen at a fictious island named San Monique. While a female saint Monica of Hippo does indeed exist, the name is pure gibberish. "San" is masculine adjective in Spanish language, while "Monique" is the French name of the saint. The correct name would have been either "Santa Monica" (Spanish) or "Sainte-Monique" (French).

While Lucy's is passable (though obviously accented to a native speaker), Uma's is atrocious and barely understandable.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SachaBaronCohen">Sacha Baron Cohen</a> takes full advantage of this trope in his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Borat">Borat</a></em> sketches and movie; his spoken "Kazakh" is actually Hebrew, with some Polish sprinkled in. His written notes are also in Hebrew. His sidekick in the film, Azamat, is actually speaking real Armenian. Almost all the Cyrillic writing used in the film and marketing materials is gibberish created by typing English words into a keyboard set for Cyrillic letters. The film's title on the DVD case is in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBackwardsR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBackwardsR">Faux Cyrillic</a>.
</li><li> Few of the Turkish characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MidnightExpress">Midnight Express</a></em> are actually Turkish. Most were local Maltese actors, since the movie was filmed in Malta. Most of the Turkish characters have pseudo-Arabic names, like Rifki and Hamidou. Real Turkish names sound different and are not limited to names of Arabic origin.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCourtJester" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCourtJester">The Court Jester</a></em>, the English Hubert Hawkins (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyKaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyKaye">Danny Kaye</a>) pretends to be a jester from Italy. When a guard asks him why he doesn't have an accent, he replies that he is fluent in many languages and demonstrates it by talking a lot of nonsensical gibberish that sounds very much like French, Italian, and German. (This skill was then known as "double-talk", and Kaye was a famous master of it.) The guard, who doesn't understand any of this, allows him to pass.
</li><li> The Spanish movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WelcomeMrMarshall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WelcomeMrMarshall">Welcome Mr. Marshall!</a></em> has a whole segment parodying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">The Western</a> movies in faux-English except a few words like "Whiskey", "Hey!" "Howdoyoudo?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopSecret" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopSecret">Top Secret!</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most of the German spoken is completely irrelevant Yiddish phrases. For example, when supposedly ordering at a restaurant, the love interest is in fact telling the waiter, "<em>Folg' mich a gang und gai in drerd</em>" — "Do me a favor and go to hell." At one point, a German soldier does respond to an order in German, severely intoning "<em>Ich liebe dich, mein Schatz</em>" — "I love you, my darling." More fake languages abound: the Swedish lines are English run backwards, and a priest reciting the last rites for a condemned man speaks mostly in stock Latin phrases, throwing in one sentence in Pig Latin ("ou're-yay oing-gay to get ied-fray in the air-chay").
</li><li> There's also the bit where Nick is riding the train to East Germany, and is learning German from a language tape.
<div class="indent"><strong>Tape</strong>: <em>Eine blitz - A pen. Eine blitz - A pen [...] Der ist Sauerkraut in my Lederhosen [...] I want a Schnauzer with my Winerschnitzel.</em>
</div></li><li> The names of the French Resistance fighters are all French loanwords (Déjà-Vu even asks if they've met before):
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Du Quois</strong> (introducing the American to the men): <em>This is Chevalier, Montage, Détente, Avant-Garde, and Déjà-Vu [...] Over there, Croissant, Soufflé, Escargot, and Chocolate Mousse.</em>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneIdentity">The Bourne Identity</a></em>, the name on Bourne's Russian passport is written "Foma Kiniaev" in Latin letters and "Aschf Lshtshfum" (Ащьф Лштшфум) in Cyrillic letters. Apparently, the designers of the prop just typed the fake Russian name in the Russian keyboard layout without actually translating it. The name was corrected to proper Фома Киняев in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSupremacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBourneSupremacy">The Bourne Supremacy</a></em>. The Russian name itself is quite correct (the English equivalent would be "Thomas"), albeit rare.
</li><li> Certainly true of the sort-of Indian cult in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Help">Help!</a></em>. Made funnier by the fact that the British actors make essentially no attempt to conceal their... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">Britishness</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticFour2005">Fantastic Four (2005)</a></em>, there's a cargo ship named "Головка пальца ноги", which means "Head of toe" (not "toe head") in Russian. The ship's owner must be a very original joker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries">The Princess Diaries</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessDiaries">The Princess Diaries</a> 2: Royal Engagement</em> play this trope straight over a cliff by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">inventing a European country</a>, "Genovia," in which the queen (Julie Andrews) is English, the peasants speak either French or English with French, English, and American accents, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautifulAllAlong">princess's</a> name is Princess Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Renaldi.
<ul><li> The books do give some explanation — for some reason, it's a Francophone country which used to be part of Italy. And the Amelia and Thermopolis parts come from her (American) mother. And no accents, obviously.
<ul><li> In the books Genovia is between France and Italy (it's basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCelebritiesWereHarmed">Not!Monaco</a>) but in the movies it's between France and Spain (Not!Andorra?).
</li></ul></li><li> Mignonette is a flower.
</li><li> Queen Clarisse (Julie Andrews) could very well have been an English princess who married the Genovian King. The fact that she is styled "Dowager" would usually mean that she was a queen consort (married into the royal family) rather than queen regnant (ruling in her own right).
</li></ul></li><li> Like in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">cartoon</a> it's based on, the characters in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastAirbender">The Last Airbender</a></em> can be assumed to actually be speaking ancient Chinese but use English as a part of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a>. All of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> writing uses the former. The show went to great lengths to have accurate writing (Chinese history professor Siu-Leung was the cultural consultant on the show and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">sequel show</a> and did all the calligraphy himself) but in the movie it's just scribbles made to look like Chinese.
</li><li> The execrable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildWorldOfBatwoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWildWorldOfBatwoman">The Wild World of Batwoman</a></em> (given a sound thrashing by the guys on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a></em>) had the main characters' seance frequently interrupted by a Chinese spirit. The spirit's Chinese mainly consisted of saying "ching", "chang", and "chong" over and over again in random combination, causing Tom Servo to deadpan "You know, that <em>may</em> not be real Chinese." As Mike says, "To every Asian and every <em>human being</em>, we apologize for that last scene."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlazingSaddles">Blazing Saddles</a>,</em> the Indian Chief (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelBrooks">Mel Brooks</a>) speaks Yiddish. This was done on purpose as a joke on an old Hollywood stereotype where American Indians were played by Jewish actors.
</li><li> Alien language examples abound in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a></em>. The Ewok speak Tagalog, a Philippine language. Huttese spoken by Greedo, Jabba, and others is bad Quechua, spoken in a variety of dialects. Lando's copilot Nien Nunb speaks the Tanzanian language of Haya.
</li><li> Apparently, those Westerns that cast Native Americans in speaking roles told them to speak their own language to add some authenticity, which would either be subtitled or translated by another character. The actors complied, but said whatever they felt like, often saying obscene or insulting things about the director, the other actors, etc. There are apocryphal stories of Native American audiences cracking up laughing during scenes that were meant to be dramatic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DancesWithWolves">Dances with Wolves</a></em> tried to avert this by teaching the actors to speak their lines in Lakotah (only one of the Indian actors spoke it fluently). Ironically, the Lakotah language coach was a woman. Lakotah is a dual language; it has male and female forms. So they're really speaking the language, but Lakotah audiences would hear<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0ae09');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0ae09" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0ae09');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and laugh at</span> the equivalent of a gang of Klingon warriors talking like Miss Marple and friends at tea.
</li><li> Trey Parker's college film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CannibalTheMusical">Cannibal! The Musical</a></em> is a film set in Colorado in 1883. At one point, they come across some "Nihonjin" Indians who are clearly Japanese people masquerading as Indians. "Nihonjin" means "Japanese person/people." At one point, the chief tries to assure the dubious main characters that they are, indeed, legitimate Indians by pointing out their teepees, one of which is made out of a Japanese flag.
</li><li> Movies made during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> that took place in the Pacific Theater usually had Koreans and Chinese as stand-ins for the Japanese. They were told to say phrases like 'I tie your shoe, you tie my shoe' faster than normal to sound like they were speaking Japanese. This was much more common during the war, when actual Japanese people were... unavailable. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note17vvj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note17vvj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note17vvj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">And by "unavailable", we mean "in internment camps".</span> Parodied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryPratchett">Terry Pratchett</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InterestingTimes">Interesting Times</a></em> with the Agatean battle cry: "Orrrrr!

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrilogy">Blade Trilogy</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EsperantoTheUniversalLanguage">Esperanto</a> is used for the street signs and posters in "foreign" cities to make the locale seem "generically European". Kris Kristofferson seriously studied speaking Esperanto for his brief scene buying a newspaper. In another scene, Hannibal King rests in a hospital watching <em>Incubus</em>, starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShatner">William Shatner</a>, one of only two Esperanto feature films in existence.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em> trilogy:
<ul><li> The Libyan terrorists from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">first film</a> speak some vaguely Arabic-sounding nonsense language.

Also, the Japanese street signs in the town square were found hilarious by Japanese tourists during filming.

<ul><li> This trope is averted for Mola Ram, who speaks flawless Hindi and whose lines make perfect sense in the context of the plot. On the other hand, he is played by a Bollywood actor who did his own translation.
</li><li> However, whenever an extra speaks, it's Sinhalese, not Hindi. This is because the Indian government didn't allow shooting in the country unless the script was changed to be less offensive to Indians. The studio moved production to Sri Lanka rather than caving.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowPeril">"Japanese" villain</a> in the 1940s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBatmanSerial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBatmanSerial">Batman</a></em> serial is named Tito Daka. Except the <em>ti</em> sound does not exist in Japanese phonetics (the closest is "ち/チ", usually romanized as <em>chi</em>).
<ul><li> "Chi" is Hepburn romanization, this syllable is rendered as "ti" in Nihon-shiki, Kunrei-shiki and JSL romanization systems. Still pronounced more like "chi" than "ti", though.
</li></ul></li><li> Skewered in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maverick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maverick">Maverick</a></em>, as, when the heroes are set upon by a band of Indians, Bret Maverick "translates" the chief's words, informing the rest of the party that they have trespassed on sacred ground, and the Indians' gods demand a blood sacrifice. As Maverick well knows (and the subtitles tell the audience), however, the chief just wants to know if Maverick has come for the money he owes him.
</li><li> In one children's movie, the young English protagonists found themselves in New Zealand watching Maori 'savages' dancing around a fire whilst chanting "Tahi! Rua! Toru! Wha!" repeatedly. As any New Zealand schoolchild should be able to tell you, this actually is genuine te reo Maori (Maori language). It translates to "One! Two! Three! Four!".
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie4">Scary Movie 4</a></em> with two characters having a subtitled conversation consisting of random Japanese words ("Karate judo sumo samurai!") and trademarks.

<ul><li> In the third film, Goldmember is a Dutch character, but he only ever uses bad German.
</li><li> There are also the twins <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">Fook Mi and Fook Yu</a>, whom Austin identifies as Japanese, but their names could more easily pass for Vietnamese or some other East or Southeast Asian language. The franchise is made of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>.
</li><li> This trope is toyed with when Austin and his father converse in their native dialect (thick British accents) in order to have some privacy while discussing an important matter in public. It starts off with some genuine slang and British idioms but, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowers">Austin Powers</a>, eventually even the subtitles themselves give up on making sense of what these two are actually saying to one another.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MillionDollarBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MillionDollarBaby">Million Dollar Baby</a></em>: <em>Mo chuisle</em> is mispronounced as "muh kwushla" rather than the actual "muh khushleh". The phrase is shown spelled in a nonstandard way. Also, Clint Eastwood's character claims to be translating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamButlerYeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamButlerYeats">William Butler Yeats</a>' poetry from Irish into English, but Yeats had only basic Irish and never wrote any Irish poetry.
</li><li> The Italian 1970 western <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Companeros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Companeros">Compañeros</a></em> had a main character that was supposed to be Swedish and was named "Yodlaf Peterson". Yodlaf is total gibberish and does not even remotely sound like any Swedish or Scandinavian names (the closest real name probably being "Jonas", or "Olaf") and while Petersson and Pettersson are common surnames in Sweden, Swedish surnames ending with -son almost always have two S's (as in "Peter's Son" contracted to Petersson). The surname would probably be excusable since occasionally people prefer to have their surnames written with only one S for aesthetic reasons, but the film does this more than once, also introducing an (fictional) brand of Swedish Safes named Svenson. The film also contains some Swedish speech, which was done surprisingly well - while badly pronounced, all the lines where grammatically correct.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminal">The Terminal</a></em>, Viktor Navorski (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks">Tom Hanks</a>) is from Krakhozia, a made-up Warsaw Pact country . He speaks passable Bulgarian, adequate to the situation. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania">Ruritania</a> he comes from is a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBonus">Genius Bonus</a>: several Slavic languages have similar sounding words for "collapse", usually written as some variation of "krach" (spelled vaguely like "krakh").

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Zulu">Zulu</a></em>: According to legend, the Zulu messenger was instructed to simply 'say something' in his native language as he collapsed at King Cetewayo's feet. This was a mistake, as what he chose to say was 'kiss my behind' or words to that effect. The Zulu actor playing the king managed to keep a straight face. But audiences of their compatriots didn't.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharliesAngels2000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CharliesAngels2000">Charlie's Angels (2000)</a></em>, there's a scene where the angels speak Finnish to each other. They discuss what a bad idea it would be to sleep with a client, but this is not what it says in the subtitles. Things get increasingly weird if you watch the movie with Finnish subtitles, which also don't match what's said.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KalPenn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KalPenn">Kal Penn</a> has said that when filming the scene where Taj loses his virginity in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanWilderThePartyLiasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanWilderThePartyLiasion">Van Wilder The Party Liasion</a></em>, the filmmakers told him to "say something in Hindoo [sic] — something religious." Instead, he said in Gujurati: "There's a white bitch under me." Penn's family are Gujarati-he doesn't speak Hindi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers">The Producers</a></em>: While Uma Thurman certainly tries to speak Swedish, it fails to the point of her lines having to be subtitled on Swedish releases. The whole thing is a bit odd since they managed to get some stuff right and some stuff plain odd. Like her "catchphrase", "<em>God dag min vännen</em>", which translates into "hello my the friend". Probably it's a mistake for "<em>vänner</em>", which would make it "hello my friends." But her accent is in no way Swedish, just generically North European, and apart from baby grammar, she indicates foreignness by referring to herself in the third person. Why this should sound "foreign" is anyone's guess, since pronouns are the first thing one learns.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheIncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a></em>, the thuggish Brazilian who harasses Bruce Banner in the early scenes speaks Portuguese with a horrible, horrible foreign accent. It's grammatically correct (or correctly incorrect for the setting), though. Really, every Brazilian not played by a Brazilian actor (there are quite a few) speaks in a barely understandable accent. Bruce Banner's emergency Portuguese actually sounded better than most of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stripes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Stripes">Stripes</a></em>, the communist soldiers of Czechoslovakia all speak with vaguely Russian-sounding grunts.
</li><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeRussian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeRussian">Lzherusskie</a> flavored example would be "General Radek", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">Greater-Scope Villain</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AirForceOne">Air Force One</a></em>. Radek sounds like an awfully Russian name, da? Well... nyet! "Radek" is not a Russian name — in fact, it's not even a (usual) surname in any Slavic language. It's a given name, specifically a typical Czech diminutive of the male name Radoslav (as a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Dr. Radek Zelenka</a> will tell you). On the other hand, there was an actual person named <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Radek">Karl Radek<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who was a genuine Communist at the time of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RedOctober">Red October</a>. On the other hand, it was a self-selected name; he was born Karol Sobelsohn (he wasn't Russian, but a Lithuanian Jew from what's now Ukraine). Had Radek actually spoken a word in the film, he would've sounded more German than Russian, given that he was played by Jürgen Prochnow, although the actor's English is pretty good.

So bad it was probably intentional. If not...
<div class="indent"> <strong>Rifftrax</strong>: The Swedish chef did a better job of faking a foreign language.
</div><ul><li> There's a minor Ukrainian character with the name of Aleksei Voskhod. "Aleksei Ascension" sounds more like a movie title than an actual name.
</li></ul></li><li> Victor Spinetti had the possibly unique ability to do this with English in English language films. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OhWhatALovelyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OhWhatALovelyWar">Oh! What a Lovely War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicalMysteryTour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MagicalMysteryTour">Magical Mystery Tour</a></em>, he plays drill sergeants who bellow incomprehensible gibberish at high speed (although in <em>Magical Mystery Tour</em>, the phrase "And get your bloody hair cut!" is very audible). Spinetti was also able to do this with Italian.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetTreasureIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MuppetTreasureIsland">Muppet Treasure Island</a></em>, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">"Cabin Fever" number</a>, a group of German sailors sings a bit that goes "Ach du lieber, Volkswagen car; Sauerbraten wienerschnitzel und wunderbar!", a word salad of German words well known to Anglophones. Justified in that they're really Englishmen taking a brief break from sanity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouDontMessWithTheZohan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YouDontMessWithTheZohan">You Don't Mess with the Zohan</a></em>. The hero is called "Zohan Dvir". While "Dvir" is a real Israeli surname, "Zohan" is... well, not. The closest first name to Zohan Hebrew has is "Zohar".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingRalph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingRalph">King Ralph</a></em>, John Goodman's titular character is introduced to King Gustav and Princess Anna of Finland. Neither name is Finnish in origin, though Anna is still fairly common, and there is a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. The fact that Finland has no royalty was an intentional break from reality.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em> and movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity">Serenity</a></em>, the major languages are English and Chinese, and do indeed have gratuitous Chinese that is more or less grammatically correct, though not pronounced correctly (and completely ignoring the way profanity works in Chinese). However, Japanese katakana is used instead of Chinese characters because Whedon thought it looked cool.
</li><li> Parts of Eli Roth's horror movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hostel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hostel">Hostel</a></em> take place in Amsterdam, capital of The Netherlands. But the scenery doesn't look like Amsterdam at all and the people talk German instead of Dutch. In the German translation, it is supposed to be somewhere in eastern Europe. Except for the businessman, who is supposed to be Dutch. He speaks Dutch in the film, even though the actor, Jan Vlasák, is Czech and didn't even speak a word of English before getting the role. He learned all of his lines, both English and Dutch, by writing them down phonetically and just cram it in...and it was awesome.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InglouriousBasterds">Inglourious Basterds</a></em> played with in-universe when the Basterds try to pass themselves off as Italians in spite of speaking only a few words of Italian and having atrocious accents. It turns out that at least one Nazi has enough of a passing familiarity to notice - and, tragically, this recognition leads directly to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of Bridget von Hammersmark</span>.
</li><li> Averted by the filmmakers as best as they could in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMummyTrilogy">The Mummy Trilogy</a></em>, where they had an official Egyptologist professor coaching actors on how to pronounce their lines in Ancient Egyptian — a reconstruction of it, anyway. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTTVRpGoPVo">This video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, on the other hand, reveals that Ardeth Bay may have said the same Arabic line on three separate occasions to mean three different things.
<ul><li> According to the commentary, Ardeth Bey said the line once. In editing, they needed a new shot in a couple of places (for pacing) and just recoloured the shot they already had.
</li></ul></li><li> Both an in-universe and media example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFortyYearOldVirgin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFortyYearOldVirgin">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a></em>: Paula, the store manager, while in a conversation with Andy, reminisces about the time when she lost her virginity to a Hispanic boy. She remembers he used to sing her a song, which is in entirely correct Spanish, but the lyrics are <em>nowhere</em> as romantic as she actually thinks they are. It translates to: "When I get to my room, I can't find anything. Where are you going in such a rush? To the soccer game." She thought it was a beautiful lullaby, while Andy just didn't get it.
</li><li> The bad guys in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em> speak in pseudogerman gibberish. This was fixed in the re-release, where the bad guys' lines were overdubbed with German native speakers  except Hans Gruber, who now sounds terribly out of place.
</li><li> An <em>intentional</em> (as in "it actually fulfills a specific purpose") example is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage">German Language</a> movie <em>Almanya - Willkommen in Deutschland</em>. It is the story of a Turkish family (speaking German, but only due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranslationConvention">Translation Convention</a>) who emigrate to Germany, where they initially have no clue what the natives are saying. In order to convey this, all Germans only speak vaguely German sounding gibberish instead of actual German. (To summarize: The audience's <em>own</em> language <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepItForeign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepItForeign">is supposed to sound foreign</a>.)
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RescueDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RescueDawn">Rescue Dawn</a></em>:, the actors who are supposed to portray Vietcong fighters are actually from Thailand and as a result, they all speak Lao and Vietnamese in the wrong accent.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Congo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Congo">Congo</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimCurry">Tim Curry</a> plays an ex-Romanian philanthroper named Herkemer Homolka. Homolka is a Czech surname, Herk<strong>i</strong>mer a German one.
</li><li> Invoked by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan">Jackie Chan</a>'s character Passpartout in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AroundTheWorldInEightyDays2004">Around the World in 80 Days (2004)</a></em>, who pretends to speak French. Most of what he ends up saying is mere gibberish.
</li><li> Whatever the translator is using for Rocky's speech from the ring at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIV">Rocky IV</a></em>, it sure doesn't sound like Russian.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless">Limitless</a></em> has a scene where Bradley Cooper is speaking Chinese to a waiter at a Chinese restaurant. There aren't any subtitles, but ask any Chinese person what he said and they'll tell you that it's incomprehensible.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Titanic1997">Titanic</a></em>. The Swedish emigrants speak perfectly correct Swedish, including situationally appropriate levels of formality. The actors' accents are hit-or-miss so it's hard to understand more than singular words for a native speaker, but once you get through that, it's apparent that research was done.
</li><li> In one scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodMenInTights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodMenInTights">Robin Hood: Men in Tights</a></em>, Robin Hood is saying goodbye to Maid Marian in different languages. All of them are correct besides the final one, "Ting tao tay!", which sounds like Chinese but means nothing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> applies, though, as the joke is about how ridiculous Robin sounds saying it. "Zài jiàn" is less amusing.
</li><li> Used for effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeRunner">Blade Runner</a></em>: Edward James Olmos' character Gaff speaks in a mixture of Spanish, French, Chinese, German, Hungarian, and Japanese, both to make the character more interesting and to indicate some huge language drift happened in the future. Olmos created a small dictionary of words for the so-called "City Speak".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiercePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiercePeople">Fierce People</a></em>, the actor portraying the Shaman in Finn's dream was actually speaking Filipino.
</li><li> Averted in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984">Red Dawn (1984)</a></em>. The Russians generally speak Russian among themselves, and the Cuban/Central Americans speak Spanish. At one point, Colonel Bella switches effortlessly from Spanish to Russian when speaking to both types of troops.
</li><li> In the Tagalog-language film <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SuperB">Super B</a></em>, the titular superheroine, played by Rufa Mae Quinto, has a mysterious ring with an inscription on it in an unknown ancient language, which she recites to transform from her civilian identity to her heroic identity. That inscription is "I wanna be, I wanna be - Super B!", in English.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodsMustBeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGodsMustBeCrazy">The Gods Must Be Crazy</a></em>, the filmmakers allowed the bushman actor N!xau make up all of his own lines because the audience is never expected to understand him. The narrator always explains what his character is saying instead. Because N!xau was disgruntled by the filmmaking process, the lines he says are often critical of the scene or the film as a whole. For example, when his character triumphantly returns to his village, he starts chastising the tribe for not rushing up to embrace him, as a real tribe would do.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnacondasTheHuntForTheBloodOrchid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnacondasTheHuntForTheBloodOrchid">Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid</a></em>, one character sports a tattoo. It is neither the language nor the meaning that he claims it to be when asked about it.
</li><li> Toto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePalmBeachStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePalmBeachStory">The Palm Beach Story</a></em> speaks an indistinguishable (presumably European) language.

According to the director's commentary, the actress's grandmother used to sing her that song, which she then used for the chant.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsWeddingNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDevilsWeddingNight">The Devils Wedding Night</a></em>, the devil-worshippers' chant includes a recognizable 'Om Mani Padme Hum' - a meditation mantra.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotTubTimeMachine">Hot Tub Time Machine</a></em>. When pretending to be a Russian spy, Nick brandishes the can of Chernobly like it was a bomb and repeatedly shouts "Dosvedanya!", which is Russian for "Goodbye" or "Farewell." As a matter of fact, a more exact translation would be "Until next time", which makes sense in their case, since they're jumping forward into the future.
</li><li> The non-English portion of the "gypsy drinking song" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyKaye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DannyKaye">Danny Kaye</a> sings in <em>The Inspector General</em> is actually a mix of Russian and Ukrainian folk music.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amistad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Amistad">Amistad</a></em>: Both the crew of the <em>Amistad</em> (a Spanish ship registered in Cuba) and the <em>Tecora</em> (a Portuguese ship) speak Mexican Spanish. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys">The two Spaniards</a> that claim damages for the loss of the <em>Amistad</em> are played by a Mexican-American and a Puerto Rican actor who use their native accents.
</li><li> <em>Georgia Rule</em> has a Basque character named Hiztegi Argitaletxea Sarrionandia (but you can call him "Izzy"). His name is genuine Basque for "Dictionary of the Sarrionandia Publishing House".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpeedRacer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpeedRacer">Speed Racer</a></em> Royalton's German is off when quoting a phrase from his childhood "When I was a child, we used to say: Pänkuchen sind Liebchen!  Pancakes are love."
</li><li> <em>Vantage Point</em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is named Tehuel Suarez. He is Moroccan. His last name is Spanish. And his first name is the name of a native tribe in Argentina.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HoubaOnTheTrailOfTheMarsupilami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HoubaOnTheTrailOfTheMarsupilami">HOUBA! On the Trail of the Marsupilami</a></em>, the language of the Paya tribesmen is mostly funny-sounding gibberish, with a few obscure references thrown in.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfBuckarooBanzaiAcrossThe8thDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfBuckarooBanzaiAcrossThe8thDimension">The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension</a></em>: Buckaroo Banzai has a Japanese father, but "Banzai" isn't a Japanese surname. It's associated with the Japanese "banzai charge" and literally means "ten-thousand years."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueLies">True Lies</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a>. Harry isn't paraphrasing when he translates the tail end of one of Aziz's speeches as, "Now no man can stop us. We are set on our course. No force can stop us, we're cool, we're badasses, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlahBlahBlah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlahBlahBlah">blah blah blah blah</a>." The actual line is literally just Arabic-sounding gibberish.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeOrlok" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LooksLikeOrlok">titular vampire</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a></em>; the word is presented as being a Transylvanian/Romanian analogue for "vampire". In actual fact, it has absolutely no counterpart in any of the languages spoken in that part of the world, though it is relatively close to two different words: the Romanian "Necuratu," meaning "unclean spirit," and the Greek "Nosophoros," meaning "bringer of plague."
</li><li> Completely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfSaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SonOfSaul">Son of Saul</a></em>; all the actors were speakers of their characters' languages.

A more authentic rendering would probably be "Iacovetta"
</li><li> The Chinese film <em>Assembly</em> has a scene in the Korean War where some Chinese soldiers dress as South Korean soldiers for a spying mission. They encounter an American tank. The tank commander asks where he is, in English, and the soldiers reply in what the subtitles call "Korean-sounding gibberish."
</li><li> The comedic (and Oscar-nominated) 1968 short film <em>De Düva: The Dove</em> (with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadelineKahn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MadelineKahn">Madeline Kahn</a> in her film debut in a small role) is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngmarBergman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngmarBergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, and can basically be described as "The Swedish Chef writes a Bergman screenplay" (though it predated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em> by a decade). The whole movie is done in hilarious mock-Swedish (with English subtitles) that's largely just English words with "-en" or "-ska" added at the end, with "translations" like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualInnuendo">phalliken zymbol</a>" (cigar) and "H2Oska" (water).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DisneysRocketMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DisneysRocketMan">Disney's RocketMan</a></em>: When talking to the President, he starts singing "I've Got The Whole World in My Hands". Everyone, including the President, picks up the song. Then Fred switches to other languages, and we're shown people all over the world singing along with him, despite what he's singing not being even remotely close to the original meaning, just a bunch of foreign words thrown together.

The Russian translator mistook it for garbled Russian, and, in the preface, he chastised Frank Herbert for "picking up the most pleasant-sounding words out of a Russian dictionary." To convey the purported effect, he translated the song into (grammatically-correct) Hindi.

(In the Swedish translation, his nationality is changed to Dutch; though, confusingly, they left in the bit about his language sounding "Hublandish", the Discworld's equivalent of "northern".) Twoflower becomes a German tourist with the last name "Zweiblumen", which is correct, but translates to "Twoflower<em>s</em>" (a straight translation of his name would be "Zweiblume"). In the Dutch version, he is named Tweebloesem (Twoblossom); the literal translation of Twoflower would be 'Tweebloem'.

However, a recently revealed bit of plot indicates that all Yokano names are originally Japanese-derived, but that there is a story-related reason why all 4 of the characters introduced from that region have "jarringly" un-Japanese nicknames.

This is explained as a sort of emotional boundary from the spells, and it's noted that, when working spells, the important bit is not so much the words themselves, but rather that the words sound right to the individual using the spell. (It's also established in one of the novels that Harry's grasp of actual Latin, used instead of English in meetings of the White Council of wizards, is <em>terrible.</em> As he repeatedly says, "Damn correspondence course." — but the book also mentions the magic words <em>won't</em> work as boundary if you actually understand them, meaning he'd have to switch to another language if he actually learned Latin) In another book, he mentions that a female wizard he grew up with prefers using pseudo-<em>Egyptian</em> in her spells.

While Fache is a real French name, the first name Bezu comes out to most French people as unheard of (there is not one Bezu X in the Paris phonebook) hilarious, as the name evokes André Bézu, a "comic" singer from the eighties, mostly known for the very corny tune <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Atu545VFbZg">La Queuleuleu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Making things worse, Bézu — the singer — usually donned a caricature of French attire complete with a beret and a blue, red, and white bowtie, perhaps making Dan Brown's choice of a name an elaborate joke on cliches about France — or not.

So convincing is his accent, he fools a Spaniard used to spot people faking accents over the phone into thinking that he's a native of Burgos before even dropping the city's name. In reality Burgos, being the heart of Old Castile, has no accent but Standard Castilian, the same used by most people and media in Spain. Spaniards jokingly say that people from Burgos have <strong>no</strong> accent.

(However, as the website hannotations.com explains, this may be deliberate due to various symbolic elements in the name.) This is one of the many reasons why among fans of <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, <em>Hannibal</em> is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanonDiscontinuity">excluded from canon</a>.
<ul><li> Mischa is also common diminutive form of the female name Mikaela/Michaela.
</li></ul></li><li> In H.P. Lovecraft's fiction, the Necronomicon was penned by an Arab named Abdul Alhazred, a fictitious name Lovecraft came up with in his childhood. The name "Alhazred" doesn't exist in Arabic and couldn't exist, given that "Abdul" ends with a suffix synonymous with the prefix of "Alhazred", so if the name were real, then it would be something like "abd-el-Hazred." "Alhazred" was coined after "Hazzard," Lovecraft mother's maiden name.

</li></ul></li><li> In the short story "Seventh Grade" by Gary Soto, a boy is in his first French class on the first day of school and tries to impress the girl he likes by pretending he already knows some French. The teacher tries to start a conversation with him, and he mumbles, "La me vava me con le grandma" and "Frenchie oh wewe gee in September." The teacher is nice enough not to rat him out, and the girl is fooled.

While "Sprechen Sie Deutsch" and "Parlez-vous Francais" are German and French for "Do you speak German/French?", the following "Wo bu hui shuo zhongwen" is Mandarin Chinese for "I can't speak Chinese." The fact that it's followed by a question mark makes it all the funnier.

He recalls once giving a sermon in Latin, at the end of which everyone said "Amen". He'd actually just told a dirty story.
</li><li> In <em>The Mister</em>, not a single one of the Albanian characters has an Albanian name. Protagonist Alessia Demachi has an Italian given name AND surname. Her betrothed Anatoly has a Russian name. Her kidnappers are named Dante and Yili. Dante is Italian again; Yili is probably a misspelling of the actual Albanian name Ylli. Her roommate is named Magda, a name used in several European languages, but still not Albanian.
</li><li> R. J. Rummel ran into this a lot regarding his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalGeneration">non-historical, foreign characters</a> in his <em>Never Again</em> series. Chinese and Muslim characters got the most of this (and perhaps coincidentally, they were the villains of the second and third books.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> of the second book (who is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Evil Counterpart</a> of the female lead</span>) is a Chinese assassin named Khoo Jy-ying, which is gibberish. She has Vietnamese ancestry as well, but that doesn't justify the name as it is still gibberish in that language also.
</li><li> Robert Ludlum is a faithful practitioner of this with Russian names like Nikolai Yurievich Yurievich. The English equivalent of this would be someone named Peterson Peterson. Russian middle names are patronymic, derived from the father's name, and Russian family names rarely end in -vich, unless the person is of Polish heritage.
</li><li> The Japanese-sounding name "Moto" has been adopted by the fictional character <em>Mr. Moto</em> and by Filipino-Japanese actress Iwa Moto, though "Moto" is not a Japanese name. Iwa Moto's real name is Eileen Iwamoto.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GemmaDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GemmaDoyle">Gemma Doyle</a> Trilogy, French was clearly provided courtesy of a translation website. The (apparently) French Mademoiselle <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaFarge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaFarge">La Farge</a> asks the titular character "Comment vous appelez-vous?" instead of just saying "Comment t'appelle-tu?" For those who don't speak French, "vous" is used when addressing strangers, elders who are not your family, and "tu" is used with acquaintances, and those of your own age and below. Google Translate always use "vous" whatever the situation.

And for the record, Farquhar  spelled with one "f"  is a <em>Scottish</em> surname, not a Welsh one.
</li><li> Raphael from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em>, being Mexican, tends to interject phrases in Spanish when he speaks. In <em>City of Ashes</em>, he tells Clary that Simon "no es muerto," which is incorrect; it should be "no <em>está</em> muerto." It seems like a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Google">Google</a> Translate error rather than it being intentional.
</li><li> Averted in Wilson's <em>Masks of the Illuminati</em>, where a supposed Russian diplomat introduces himself by the name of Salmonovitch.

</li><li> The first book of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RiversOfLondon">Rivers of London</a></em> features a Danish trophy wife named August Coopertown, <em>née</em> Fischer. August Fischer is a perfectly acceptable, if a bit archaic-sounding, Danish <em>man's</em> name.

Several are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousNamedForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamousNamedForeigner">named after famous Spanish people</a> with no regard for ethnicity (notably, none of the Basque nationalist characters has a Basque name), are often misspelled (there is a "Pedros" rather than Pedro and a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElSpanishO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElSpanishO">Patricko</a>" instead of Patricio, to say nothing of last names), used in the wrong context (a little boy is called "Manolo" by his grandfather, the way someone older named Manuel would be called by his buddies; a prison guard meeting the Prime Minister in a serious context is called "Juanito" - an endearing diminutive for people named Juan) or are actually last names used as first names. This happens in English, especially in the USA, but not in Spanish. Since Sheldon also seems ignorant that Spaniards have two last names instead of one, he likely mistook first last names for middle names and used them as first names.
</li><li> That there is more than one language in Spain seems an idea hard to understand by English-speaking writers. Michael Eisner's <em>The Crusader</em> is set in Medieval Catalonia two centuries before the unification of Spain, but every character has a Spanish name. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools">bland</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">modern</a></em> Spanish name.

The given name "Yassen" ("ياسين"‎) is of <em>Arabic</em> origin, and it's far more common in the Middle East than in Russia. "Gregorovich", while not <em>completely</em> unheard-of, is much more common as a patronymic than a family name, since it just means "Son of Gregory". The first part was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">addressed</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Prequel">prequel</a> novel <em>Russian Roulette</em>, which reveals that Yassen's birth name was "Yasha" ("Яша"), a far more common Russian name.

While Park is one of the most common Korean last names, it's virtually never used as a <em>first</em> name. Calling a Korean person "Park" is like calling an Irish person "O'Connor".

</li><li> Chicago's song "Saturday in the Park" refers to "A man selling ice cream/Singing Italian songs," followed by an improvised and incomprehensible line in pseudo-Italian. It's a slurred version of a popular children's lyric; "Eh cumpari, ci vo' sunari?" which translates as "Hey buddy, what's that sound?" It's clearer in live shows.

</li><li> Boney M.'s "Rasputin", though about a Russian figure, throws in some German words: "...the kasatschok he danced really wunderbar". Note that Boney M. were based in West Germany, although they usually sang in English.
<ul><li> It's not as bad a match as some might think; the Czar was of course of German ancestry and Rasputin's alleged lover, the "Russian queen" Alexandra, was born German (as princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt) and of course spoke and corresponded with her friends and German relations in her native language, German. (And she and her family liked to vacation in Hesse before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>.)
</li></ul></li><li> "Ue o muite aruko" by Kyu Sakamoto was on the top forty in Japan and the U.S., where it was given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonAppearingTitle">Non-Appearing Title</a> "Sukiyaki" simply because the DJs who played it didn't know Japanese. It's been pointed out that this is more or less the equivalent of releasing "Moon River" in Japan under the title "Beef Stew".
</li><li> "Spanish Bombs" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheClash">The Clash</a> has a refrain which is supposed to be Spanish but is not actually a complete, comprehensible phrase.

Both texts were written in a Japanese keyboard while typing respectively "dj lhasa" and "together forever" in kana mode.
</li><li> Madonna did this again with the song <em>Sorry</em>, which has the phrase <em>I am sorry</em>, sang in different languages. The Dutch line <em>Ik ben droevig</em>, is not only mispronounced with a 'k' sound instead of a 'g' (as in 'g'reat), but actually translates to <em>I am sad</em>, not <em>sorry</em>.

The Twelfth Man parodies cricket commentary with dead-on impressions of legends like Richie Benaud, with a smattering of "foreign" names like Jarvegemite Fermeeandad or the batting partnership of Kuttis Arminahf and Soonil Havaskar. He even does it with English names like grounds curator Bob Durunkel and Doug Deep, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">Moment of Awesome</a> was his impression of NRL commentator Ray "Rabs" Warren reading out the upcoming <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nDeChysygA">New Zealand ruby side<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Impressive, though NSFW.
</li><li> The rock group <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Blondie">Blondie</a> is notorious in certain circles for gratuitous French lyrics that, while not exactly gibberish, tend to be painfully literal and non-idiomatic translations from English. To a fluent speaker, the French verse of "Sunday Girl" in particular is little more than a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DickAndJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DickAndJane">Dick and Jane</a></em> level translation of one of the English verses; other songs are almost as bad, and "Call Me" throws in random stings of gratuitous <em>Italian</em> as well.
</li><li> DJ Snake's "Taki Taki" repeats the phrase "Taki Taki" to sound exotic, though it doesn't mean anything.
</li><li> "Rock of Ages" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DefLeppard">Def Leppard</a> starts out with a German nonsense phrase "Gunter glieben glauchen globen".

Written by Adriano Celentano (an Italian songwriter) during a period in which American music was extremely popular in Italy, as half an experiment, half a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> at the fact that Italians would buy anything sung in English despite not speaking the language. The words are pure gibberish, but they <em>sound</em> eerily like American English.
</li><li> Similarly, the opening from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hellsing">Hellsing</a></em> TV series, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJfeCTyTqP8">"The World Without Logos"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Yeah, there are a few distinguishable English words in there, but most of that is just nonsense.

(It's apparently just a language that was made up for the song.)
</li><li> The backing vocals on Paul Simon's "The Boy in the Bubble" from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Graceland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Graceland">Graceland</a>- sung by Simon himself - consist of nonsense words that sound vaguely African.

</li><li> Somewhat inverted with Adiemus. The language for this series of albums was deliberately stylized <em>not</em> to be in any recognizable tongue. Instead, the intent was for the listener to percieve the voices as instruments, as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiemus">The Other Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> explains.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> uses the phrase "Ouvre le chien" in two different songs. The literal translation from French is "Open the dog."
</li><li> Played for humor in the Angry Salad cover of Nena's "99 Red Balloons": their version is mainly in English (based on the translated version released as a single), but towards the end vocalist Bob Whelan starts throwing in stock German phrases, as a tongue in cheek nod to the original German version: "99 o tannenbaum, weinerschnitzel <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrvergn&lt;!--C3--&gt;BCgen">Fahrvergnügen...<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LionelRichie">Lionel Richie</a>'s "All Night Long" features some African-sounding gibberish in its breakdown section. Richie originally wanted an authentic translation, but after learning there were thousands of languages spoken in Africa, he decided it was easier to just make something up.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LadyGaga">Lady Gaga</a> song "Scheisse". While the title is the German word for "shit", the German-sounding refrain is meaningless.
</li><li> Sophie B. Hawkins' "As I Lay Me Down" has the exotic-sounding but nonsensical syllables "ooh la kah koh" as backing vocals. She once claimed it meant "wash your feet before you sleep" in "an indigenous language of the Ballantine tribe" <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3mhrr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3mhrr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3mhrr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Ballantine is in fact Sophie B.

</li><li> Stephen Stills (who attended a school in Costa Rica during his youth) has <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suite:_Judy_Blue_Eyes#Final_section">supposedly claimed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the "Spanish" at the end of "Suite:Judy Blue Eyes" is meant to be incomprehensible even to Spanish speakers, and that he arranged the "doo doo doo doo doo, dat doot doo doo doo dit"s over them to obscure it and make it even more difficult to decipher.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CocteauTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CocteauTwins">Cocteau Twins</a> built their career around this. Sometimes, in Elizabeth Fraser's euglossolalic vocalizations, you can hear fragments of actual words in English or some other languages (supposedly odd bits of obscure Scottish slang), although the albums <em>Heaven or Las Vegas</em> and <em>Four-Calendar Café</em> contained slightly more comprehensible lyrics ("Bluebeard" is actually identifiable as English!). Robin Guthrie says the Japanese audiences, when they played shows there, sort of inverted the trope in that they'd all actually thought she was singing in Japanese.

And yet, some brilliant minds decided to select the song "Waka Waka", by Colombian singer <a class="urllink" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira?from=Main.Shakira">Shakira<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as the official song for the 2010 FIFA world cup in South Africa. Because, you know, it sounds "African" enough, and South Africa is the entire continent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a>'s "Mustapha" is sung in a mixture of English, Arabic and complete gibberish made up by Freddie Mercury (often claimed to actually be Arabic or Farsi but isn't).
</li><li> The choruses of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow">Ying Tong Song</a></em> sound to English speakers like Chinese (or nonsense Chinese), but were never intended by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeMilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeMilligan">Spike Milligan</a> to be anything other than pure nonsense. The lyric was derived from the name of a friend of Milligan's called Edgington (nicknamed "Edgyingtong") who bet Milligan that he couldn't get a song with only two chords into the record chart.
</li><li> Karl Jenkins' "Adiemus" is sung in vaguely Latin-sounding nonsense.
</li><li> The singer/drummer of Finnish rock group Hurriganes notoriously did not know any English, yet they decided to sing entirely in English. This meant that all the lyrics had to be written out phonetically, and a lot of the songs came out as barely English-sounding gibberish.
</li><li> The entire point of the self-titled album <em>Caramba</em> by the Swedish nonce band of the same name: Every single track is a comedic version of a particular ethnic group's music and language. Spoytnik, for example, is a pseudo-mazurka performed in pseudo-Russian, and Fido (pronounced fee-do) is a pseudo-mento performed in pseudo-English in a pseudo-Caribbean accent. In the case of the best-known track, Haba Haba Zoot Zoot, the ethnic group in question appears to be Martians.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackLips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackLips">The Black Lips</a> song "Hippie Hippie Hoorah" is a cover of the song "Hippie Hippie Hourra" by French musician <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacquesDutronc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JacquesDutronc">Jacques Dutronc</a>. All of the French lyrics are completely discarded except for a fragment of the chorus "Je suis hippie, Je suis hippie" (I'm a hippy, I'm a hippy), which the singer garbles into "Je suis, Je suis... Le pee... le peepee" in a mock French accent.
</li><li> From the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MissyElliott" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MissyElliott">Missy Elliott</a> song "Work It": "Boys, boys, all type of boys / Black, White, Puerto Rican, Chinese boys / Why-thai,-thai-o-toy-o-thai-a-thai / Rock-thai,-thai-o-toy-o-thai-a-thai."

Some of it is just strangely enunciated English - "The Festival Of Death" includes a chant of "Coca-Cola adds life!" (a reference to an advertising slogan of the time). However, this fake Chanting makes up 99% of the lyrics/spoken parts.
</li><li> In general, when a choir is used in a popular song (or a film score), the lyrics will be either gibberish or English sung/pronounced in such a way that it sounds foreign.
</li><li> There are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlieParker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CharlieParker">Charlie Parker</a> compositions called things like "Au Privave", "Ah-Leu-Cha", and "Klact-Overseeds-Tene". None of which really mean much.

Unsure of her nationality, he takes random, wild stabs at every continent.
</li><li> Martin Denny's 1957 album "Exotica" spawned an entire musical genre of the same name, which Denny described as "a combination of the South Pacific and the Orient... what a lot of people imagined the islands to be like... it's pure fantasy though."

</li><li> "Don't Bring Me Down" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ElectricLightOrchestra">Electric Light Orchestra</a> includes "grooossss", which is not a word but a gibberish syllable that Jeff Lynne threw in thinking it sounded German. However, so many people have misheard it as "Bruce" that he actually sings that in concerts nowadays.
</li><li> In the song "Vertigo" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/U2">U2</a>, lead singer Bono begins with "unos, dos, tres, catorce!".

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> poked fun at this trope with the Curry Man gimmick, who was supposedly Japanese, but was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">NOT</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChristopherDaniels">Christopher Daniels</a>, an American white guy.

The funny thing is, that pronunciation of the letter H is actually less posh, going against his "British Snob" persona for those in the know.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IlivaisX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IlivaisX">Ilivais X</a></em> has this in abundance. Iriana and Seyne Estchell are supposed to come from Serbia, but their names are vaguely French if anything, and Estchell doesn't come from anything. Essen Dywell isn't an English/Chinese name at all, Sura Verandis is more nonsense than Scandinavian or Arabic, and plenty other examples that come from vague backgrounds. Mille Chanteau, while a bit archaic in French, is perfectly valid though.
</li><li> Similarly to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em>, in ''<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AvatarTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AvatarTheAbridgedSeries">Avatar: The Abridged Series</a>" Spanish is rendered mostly as English with "El" tacked on.

</li></ul></li><li> As Long As It Looks Elvish... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> invented the tengwar script as a writing system for Middle-Earth. The rules for writing in tengwar are complicated, vary a lot across languages, and some languages can be spelt in several different ways: one sign could stand for a few different sounds depending on the writing mode. So when people started making fonts to let them write tengwar on the computer, they usually mapped them to the keys in the tengwar's "grid"-formation. This is relatively easy to use, if you know what you're doing. Unfortunately, there are still people who <em>don't</em> know what they're doing who make fanart/fansites/whatever with little decorative bits of tengwar floating around, and who get the tengwar just by grabbing a font and typing things in literally. This leads to drawings of Elwë Singollo that are labeled, in beautiful and elegant Elvish lettering, "Febw Gywnghweehw".
<ul><li> Approximately the same thing happens to Hebrew, Cyrillic, and katakana/hirigana fonts. Some characters represent sounds that require more than one character in the Latin alphabet, and some sounds simply don't exist in the other language. Complicating things further is that in some modes the Elvish languages use accent marks to represent vowels rather than having separate characters for them... something that looks like an m with a dot over it could be intended to be read as the equivalent of in, en, ni or ne depending on mode.
</li></ul></li><li> Kotaku doesn't mean anything in Japanese. Even though Ko can mean "small," it still doesn't mean "small otaku."

As in case of character names, the only normal sounding name is <em>Kenny</em> Fanal from <em>The Secret Programs</em> and <em>Clair</em> Tyranof in <em>Route of Land</em>. It doesn't help that those oddly sounded names are <em>completely made up by mixing syllables</em>. But considering that they were all set in foreign planets, this may be justified.
</li><li> On a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Cracked">Cracked</a></em> Top 5 list, it was mentioned that, to Americans, the Japanese language sounds like "ching chong." Neither of those two phonemes exist in Japanese.

In several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartimeCartoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WartimeCartoon">wartime cartoons</a>, "humorously" fractured German or Japanese is spouted by the villains and is the same thing. Also, most of the spoken and written "French" in the Pepe' Le Pew cartoons is undisguised English with "Le" tacked on front and an "e" on the end.

Neither of their names are usual Scandinavian names. To be fair, the three American members of the band don't have usual names either. There aren't very many Murderfaces in the phone book.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TexAvery">Tex Avery</a>'s <em>Flea Circus</em> also uses undisguised English for "French" words by tacking "Le" in front. However, this sounds wrong for French speaking people, as French has two articles, "Le" for masculine and "La" for feminine words. This is especially noticeable as one of the main characters named "Fifi <strong>le</strong> Flea" is a girl and "puce", French for "flea" is a feminine word. The same applies to other written "French" like <strong>Le</strong> Church, <strong>Le</strong> Maternity and <strong>Le</strong> End, which are all feminine in French. Had the writer done the research, Fifi <strong>la</strong> Flea would been to <strong>la</strong> Church, then <strong>la</strong> Maternity before the happy <strong>la</strong> End.
<ul><li> The mistake is a common one (Spanish works similarly, with "El" for masculine words and "La" for feminine.) because English is one of the few languages where the vast majority of nouns are genderless, thus the assumption by the English-speaking animators that one version of "the" works for all situations.

The words they spoke were Japanese alright, but they spoke it completely out of context, especially since the words were like "Sushi" and "Sashimi" that most western audiences would know anyways.

<ul><li> The brand names Aquafina and Dasani were chosen by marketing firms to sound exotic without meaning anything in particular.
</li><li> Car companies have an awful habit of doing this, often naming models with words that sound foreign.
<ul><li> An American example is "Bravada."
</li><li> Japanese examples include "That's", "Ist" (German for "is"), "Stepwgn," "March," "Probox" (a Dutch brand of roof boxes), "President," "Friendee," "Hijet," "Expert," and "Custom Move."
</li><li> The Mitsubishi Pajero is named for a South American wildcat, but in many Spanish dialects "pajero" is slang for "wanker." Thus when this model is sold in most Spanish-speaking countries, it is instead called the Mitsubishi Montero. As one of the Spanish-speaking countries in which "pajero" means "wanker" is Mexico, it is also sold as the Montero in the United States (since the proportion of people who speak Mexican Spanish in the US is rather large).
</li><li> The "Deora", Chrysler's concept pickup from 1965, was given that name because they thought it was the female form of "golden" in Spanish (it's actually "Dorada"). Maybe they got confused when they heard "de oro", which means "(made) of gold", and simply exchanged an "o" for an "a".

Häagen-Dazs lost because of the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unclean_hands">"unclean hands" doctrine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - to quote the judge:
<div class="indent"> Although defendants dispute the accuracy of these charges, even if true they simply do not advance plaintiff's case at all. On the contrary, since plaintiff itself has attempted to package its product in such a way as to give the impression that it is of Scandinavian origin, although it too is, in fact, of domestic origin, it is guilty of the same deceptive trade practices of which it accuses defendants.

A sample sentence: "Europanto want nicht informe aber amuse." It started as a journalist's joke, but now there are forums dedicated to its use.
</li><li> Swedish humour magazine <em>Grönköpings Veckoblad</em> uses a Esperanto parody, Transpiranto, which uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">bilingual puns and Swedish words phonetically translated into German, French, Italian, English or other European languages.</a>

However, this text is usually completely meaningless, and people apparently just like the way it looks. He also notices that Japanese rock bands seem prone to choosing bizarre English names, with some very interesting results.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a>'s Money Secrets</em> includes a series of allegedly useful phrases ("Where is the Internet?") for people who want to appear fluent in foreign languages to memorize. While the European phrases are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoirotSpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoirotSpeak">Poirot Speak</a> translations, all the Japanese phrases are represented by the same three kanji of the kind that could be someone's name, and the Chinese phrases are actually random Japanese characters put together (the kanji meaning "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseLanguage">Japanese Language</a>" occurs twice).
</li></ul></li><li> One of the reasons that some people have a backlash against anime and manga fans is because of the ones who think adding "-umi" or "-aki" or "-oni" at the end of a bunch of garbled letters equals a Japanese name. Leading to character names like <em>Tsashi Chizuru</em>, <em>Aeashi Tomeoko</em> and <em>Heashmi Concaro</em>. Because if it's got a lot of colliding vowels in it, it <em>must</em> be Japanese! Also, while "-san" is an actual Japanese term, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseHonorifics">there are rules for using it</a>.
</li><li> Many "Spanish" place names in the American Southwest were actually invented by English speakers who wanted them to <em>sound</em> Spanish. In some cases, because these folks didn't actually know Spanish well at all, they turn out to be gibberish. For example, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_Vista">Isla Vista, California<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Vista,_Los_Angeles">Mar Vista, Los Angeles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Vista,_Arizona">Sierra Vista, Arizona<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindIdiotTranslation">Blind Idiot Translations</a> of "Island View", "Sea View" and "Mountain View" respectively that sounded foreign enough to their English-speaking christeners. So for example, in Spanish "Isla Vista" means "Seen Island" (i.e., "island that somebody has seen at some point in history"). Same goes for any American placename with "Vista" in it; the idiomatic way of naming places like that in Spanish would be <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramar">''Miramar''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for "Sea View" or <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramonte">''Miramonte''<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for "Mountain View."
<ul><li> Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is guilty of this. Before marrying Corina Raigosa he was just Tony Villar. He added his name to his wife's name to come up with the far more ethnic-sounding (but utterly meaningless) "Villaraigosa" when he went into politics (and re-adopted his ethnic birthname "Antonio" rather than the anglicized diminutive "Tony"), to appeal to the large Hispanic population in Los Angeles. The correct way of mixing both last names is Villarraigosa (with two r's), not Villaraigosa. And Villar is a perfectly good Spanish surname.
</li></ul></li><li> According to some scholars, the name of the US state of Idaho was invented as part of a hoax. It supposedly was chosen as a nonsense word that sounded vaguely Native American (never mind that that doesn't really make any linguistic sense).

<ul><li> Oregon easily has the most confusing etymology of any state name. The earliest citation is a 1765 document by explorer Robert Rogers claiming that local natives called the Columbia River "Ouragon". But there's no other evidence of this name being used, leading to suspicion that Rogers either just made the name up, altered the name of the Ohio River (<em>Waregan</em>) in the language of the Abenaki people clear across the country in Maine, took it from a misspelling of the Wisconsin River on an old French map, or took it from the French word for "hurricane" (<em>ouragan</em>). Other theories involve the Spanish word <em>orejón</em> ("big ears") or even the spice name "oregano".

</li><li> In Melbourne, Australia, there is an annual festival called <em>Moomba</em>, which was suggested as a name by local Indigenous Australians, who translated it as something along the lines of "let's get together and have fun". In reality, 'Mum' (pronounced 'moom') means 'buttocks/anus' and '-ba' is a suffix meaning 'on, in, at' in several Aborigial languages of the area. The result means, roughly, "Up yours."

It's originally a slice of random text from Cicero, modified from proper Latin to approximate the standard letter distribution of English. It's supposed to <em>look</em> like Latin, but not be distracting by actually meaning anything.

</li><li> Quite a few Chinese restaurants have Mandarin-ish or Cantonese-ish sounding names, but the name translates out to gibberish. This might be because actual Mandarin and Cantonese are quite difficult for non-speakers to pronounce.

</li></ul><div class="indent"> "I got drunk and got a tattoo here <em>(points to the side of his abdomen)</em> in Mandarin that says 'Happiness and Laughter'. I think that's what it says, since I've never had a Chinese person that close enough to my balls to say, 'That's what it says.' But a friend of mine got a tattoo in Mandarin that said 'Golden Warrior' but later someone told him, 'No, it says "Ass Monkey".' And then the same guy got a tattoo in Hindi that said 'Dawn of Enlightenment' but then someone told him, 'No, it says "Deliveries on Tuesday".'

</li></ul></li><li> New Age "Native American spirituality" types often greet with "osiyo" and end with "mitakuye oyasin". The former is Cherokee. The latter is Lakota, thousands of miles away, and translates as "all my relatives" - which, without a verb, means nothing. (Cherokee and Lakota are not even known to be related; Cherokee is a Southern Iroquoian language, related to, well, the Iroquois languages of New York State—Seneca, Tuscarora, Mohawk, Onondaga, Cayuga—and elsewhere in the Northeast, while Lakota is a Siouan language. Relationships have been proposed between them—there is evidence that they either share a distant common ancestor or that their respective distant ancestors were in close contact with each other and formed a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachbund">sprachbund<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but either way, it's in the very, very distant past.) People who want to greet each other in Cherokee should say "Donada'govi", or in Lakotah say "doksha", for "farewell until we meet again."
</li><li> Spammers will often pick one of two names to title their emails. They will either pick a stereotypical English name (often from the names of dead presidents), or they will pick some incredibly foreign name from the country they claim to be from.
</li><li> The hot dog fast food chain Wienerschnitzel (originally Der Wienerschnitzel) does not serve wiener schnitzel, a lightly battered and fried veal cutlet. American customers just supposed hear "wiener," to make them think of a hot dog, and some random German, to make it sound more exotic and authentic. To make matters worse, "Wienerschnitzel" is neuter, not masculine, so the correct German would be "das Wienerschnitzel."
</li><li> Japanese composer Kouji Makaino has used foreign-sounding pseudonyms such as Mark Davis, Jimmy Johnson or Michael Korgen when composing music that would eventually used in commercials <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Japandering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Japandering">featuring foreign celebrities</a>

Sometimes their choice of names can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">Unfortunate Implications</a>, for example, <em>Helen Keller</em>-branded <em>glasses frames</em>.
</li><li> IKEA does this with the names of their furniture. It's either foreign sounding place or just random Swedish words. Its also an example of this being done intentionally, as the chain is Swedish in origin.
</li><li> Adam Hills, an Australian comedian, has a routine all about this. He uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Swedish Chef</a> as an example of how people imitate other languages. He then goes on to say that those who go a little further just imitate the accent and make up gibberish while adding in an occasional word in that language.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hills</strong>: (<em>imitating a French person ... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">who speaks English</a></em>) This person came up to me and said (<em>puts on a ridiculous American accent</em>) 'Bow-dow-ga-dow-bow-ga-dow burger, bow-dow-ga-dow friiiiiiies bow-dow-ga-dow <strong>WOOOOOO HOO!</strong>'
</div></li><li> One of Panera Bread's menu items, the Frontega Chicken Panini, seems to be an example of this. "Frontega" sounds vaguely Spanish (which would make some sense, since the sandwich includes chipotle mayo) but isn't an actual Spanish word.

It does sound German, and it helps that Century worked with Bayer AG in formulating the paint along with some of their other products, but if you know the language or look it up on the dictionary, you could tell that Century merely chose the name, which actually means "a number", to give the brand some credibility, considering how Germany excels in science and technology. It's not like Filipino automotive enthusiasts or body shop workers would probably care, let alone look it up, just as long as the paint job looks good.
</li><li> In Hannibal, Mo. there is a restaurant (formerly a gentleman's club) called La Binnah. The menu includes French, Turkish, and Italian cuisine with many patrons wondering if the name of the restaurant comes from any of those languages. As it turns out, La Binnah is simply Hannibal spelled backwards but written to look as though it has a non-English name.
