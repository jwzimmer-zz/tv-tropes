(For example, ritual magic is usually stronger than other magic, but takes longer and requires spell components. Meanwhile, academic wizards usually only need to speak or even think to use a spell, but their craft requires great training, study, and discipline.) One frequent representation of this is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a> seen when people with opposite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">Elemental Powers</a> fight each other.

<ul><li> In the first movie to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CardcaptorSakura">Cardcaptor Sakura</a></em>, it is revealed that Clow Reed had a rival in the form of a water-diviner known only as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">Madoushi.</a> She was always trying to outdo him, but he always prevailed, mainly because <em>her</em> power was used mainly for personal gain (thus limiting its potential), and Clow Reed used it for other (benevolent) purposes too. The rivalry is complicated because she had feelings for him, which <em>may</em> have been reciprocated <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0io1b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0io1b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0io1b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">The databooks</a> actually call her his former lover, which would imply that he at least slept with her once. </span>...but she became a threat and had to be sealed away in an alternate dimension by Clow. (In the English dubbed version, she is a former student of his who actually became his girlfriend...and then turned to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>, whereupon Clow broke up with her and then sealed her away.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheAncientMagusBride">The Ancient Magus' Bride</a></em>, Alchemists, who treat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticScience">magic as a science</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">that can be learned by anyone, with enough practice</a>, use a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermeticMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HermeticMagic">Hermetic Magic</a>; Mages are born with their powers, which stem from communication with the world of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic">Wild Magic</a> and are therefore both much more potent and much more dangerous to learn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> has the magic side and the science side (the latter having both advanced technology and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">espers</a>).
<ul><li> To begin with, both sides have a mutual treaty to minimise contact with each other. This results in the vast majority of the science side having no knowledge of magic, though the reverse is not true. A number of magicians look down on science. When science-side characters encounter magic, they often don't believe it's real and/or think it's actually esper abilities.
</li><li> The science side was founded by Aleister Crowley, a legendary magician who founded the modern system of magic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigot">but later came to hate it</a>. Aleister considers his personal style of magic to be superior to that used by others because it avoids collateral damage. His primary goal is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wipe out magic</span>.
</li><li> The science side is relatively unified, with no particular conflict between espers with different types of powers - telekinetics and telepaths don't hate each other, for example. There is conflict between espers of different power levels, but that falls outside this trope.
</li><li> The magic side is heavily divided due to conflict between faiths, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">most magic is based on religion</a>. The three main magic factions are the Anglican Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Russian Orthodox Church. These generally don't get along with each other and sometimes reach the point of open combat. Then there are smaller organisations like magic cabals, which are generally looked down on by the bigger groups.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeLeagueElite">Justice League Elite</a></em> story, the team goes up against the witch Circe. The team mystic, Manitou Raven, shows disdain for Circe's methods, claiming that they barely qualify as magic because they don't involve any kind of personal sacrifice as his magic does.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TarotWitchOfTheBlackRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TarotWitchOfTheBlackRose">Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose</a></em>, the world of witches is portrayed as being perpetually divided by methods and ideologies. This is presented as largely a good thing, as it allows for individuality and prevents zealots like Raven Hex or Azure from organizing the witches for evil ends.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Fan Works </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In a minor example, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheKeysStandAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheKeysStandAlone">The Keys Stand Alone</a>: The Soft World</em>, it turns out normal wizards, or at least Amboyse from Pachet's Fine Spells and Scrolls, look down on Native magic (the kind that Paul knows). Whether the Native wizards feel the same way about normal magic is not known.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BlackSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/BlackSky">Black Sky</a></em>, Dying Will Flames are <em>very</em> <strong>not</strong> magic, in spite of the resemblances. Magic comes from the blood, and Soulfire - as it is called by the magical protagonists - comes from the soul (duh). Squalo is quite miffed by the wizards' insistence to label the Flames as magic, while Narcissa Malfoy blatantly considers the Flame-Actives as different from magicals and muggles.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> has two schools of magic - Wanded and Wandless. As a rule, Wanded is more controlled and precise, more standardised, and much quicker to pick up, while Wandless takes longer to develop, but is much more intuitive and flexible, and practitioners live much longer. The differences are inborn, and compared to being right or left handed. However, like being right or left handed, they're not exclusive or insurmountable; there are varying degrees of overlap in talent (e.g. there are Wanded wizards such as John Constantine with natural ability at Wandless magic), and they can be overcome through training - moreover, Giovanni and Sindella Zatara, parents of Zatanna Zatara, invented a fused version of the Art.
<ul><li> Additionally, Wandless practitioners have a number <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> style distinctions: Wizard (gender-neutral term, part of the White Council: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> equivalent of a PhD and/or a Black Belt, though a certain level of power is required), Sorcerer/Sorceress (mid to heavy weight practitioner, but poorly educated), Warlock (also gender-neutral, power-level irrelevant - someone who's broken one of the 7 Laws of Magic), and 'Minor Talent' or 'whatevermancer' for lesser/more specialised practitioners. Wizards tend to look down on all of the others, and not <em>entirely</em> without reason... but the associated arrogance can be their downfall.

<ul><li> One of the worst insults you can deliver to a sorcerer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad">The Belgariad</a></em> is to call him a "magician". Sorcerers use their Will, focused by a Word, to perform their feats. Magicians tell their (hopefully-)bound demons to go do something.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DianaWynneJones">Diana Wynne Jones</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Chrestomanci" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Chrestomanci">Chrestomanci</a></em> Chronicles, there are levels and ranks in magic from "the lowest certified witch" to the most powerful nine-lived enchanters. Passing references are made to people being sorcerers, magicians, hedgewitchs, warlocks, hags (though the last three are insulting).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfNarnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a></em>: In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagiciansNephew">The Magician's Nephew</a></em>, Jadis holds Andrew Ketterley in contempt for almost as many reasons as the reader does, but they're all different reasons — and the very first is this trope: "You are a Magician — of a sort ... a little piddling Magician who works by spells and books. There is no real Magic in your blood or heart."
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse">Circleverse</a></em> series, the two types of mages (ambient and academic) each view the other with derision; the academics view the ambients as backwater weaklings, and the ambients view the academics as stuffy snobs. Academic mages are those who have an inner font of plain power that they can channel into any direction they want. However, ambient mages have a different magic which only responds to (and can act upon) the magic within the outside world, and is associated with a certain discipline, such as metalworking, cooking, or gardening. Nearly all of the protagonists are ambient mages. And if you thought <em>any</em> kind of ambient magic could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">useless or silly</a>? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">No. NONE of them are</a>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CraftSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CraftSequence">Craft Sequence</a></em>, there are two fundamentally different ways of working magic. First came Practical Theology— making (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyBindingContract" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicallyBindingContract">very binding</a></em>) pacts with gods, who in return for worship both worked direct miracles and empowered their priests as divine spellcasters. Then, much more recently, the Craft was developed— magic woven from starlight by pure human will. A nearly-genocidal (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">nearly omnicidal, in fact</span>) series of God Wars ensued between practitioners of the two arts. Craftspeople won, but the terms of the peace were at least tolerable for most Theologians and their surviving Gods.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiogenesClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiogenesClub">Diogenes Club</a></em> short story "Sorcerer Conjuror Wizard Witch" has the main characters investigating four individuals, each fitting one of the terms in the title, and each said to protect the city of London in some mystical way, to see if one is evil. The Sorcerer is the Astronomer Royal, the Conjuror is a stage magician, the Witch is a high society hostess, and the Wizard is an old kook who keeps the ravens at the Tower of London. Each of them have some ongoing feuds with at least one of the others.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> stories play with this topic in various ways:
<ul><li> Witches versus wizards? There is considerable philosophical difference. Witches are village wisewomen who perform some unintrusive magic, but mostly use tricks and "headology" (psychology), though they're able to do pretty powerful stuff if they need to. Wizards go to Unseen University (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a>) and spend long years learning, similarly, not to use serious magic unless absolutely necessary. The differences between them are mostly in their public image and in the <em>kind</em> of magic they... aren't using. The short story <em>The Sea and Little Fishes</em> presents the basic difference as basically the same as a hammer and a lever: wizards tend to use the magical equivalent of lots and lots of brute force, while witches tend to use their magic in subtler but equally as powerful ways. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EqualRites">Equal Rites</a></em> examines this, as it's about a girl who has a talent for wizardry, although she's also a skilled witch. When she shows up again some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman">thirty-five books later</a>, she's drifted more towards witchcraft, but still has a talent for quantum-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiBabble">Magi Babble</a> (the Elasticated String Theory) that would fit well in the High Energy Magic Building. <em>Equal Rites</em> also has the one direct magical combat between a powerful witch (Granny Weatherwax, by general acclamation the most powerful witch in the world) and a powerful wizard (Archchancellor Cutangle, who reached the rank in an era when if a wizard blinked, they died) in the books; they are interrupted after being stuck in a draw for a while and later both just seem embarrassed about the whole thing and try to pretend it never happened - though it should be said that Cutangle is left with an uncomfortable feeling that if it had gone on much longer, Granny would have won.
<div class="indent">Why was it that when she heard Granny ramble on about witchcraft she longed for the cutting magic of wizardry, but whenever she heard Treatle speak in his high-pitched voice she would fight to the death for witchcraft? Shed be both or none at all.
</div><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShepherdsCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShepherdsCrown">The Shepherd's Crown</a></em>, the last book in the series, brings things full circle with a boy who wants to become a witch. Although he does prove adept at the medical and "social services" angle, he never manages to do actual witch-style magic. He does develop a preternatural ability to calm potentially violent situations and encourage people to improve their own lives, which his trainer believes to be something completely new. The plotline is never really resolved, most likely thanks to the book being unfinished due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorExistenceFailure">Author Existence Failure</a>.
</li><li> As noted above, the <em>point</em> of the wizards at UU is to <em>not</em> use magic. You don't want <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">ambitious</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">greedy</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">idealistic</a> people with magic, because as is continually pointed out <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EquivalentExchange">magic has a price</a>!</em> Recently, though, they seem to be making a better active contribution to society by studying and building magic devices, and other more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">useful</a> applications, rather than just throwing fireballs around.
</li></ul></li><li> Aside from the rivalry between wizards and witches, there is also generational disconnect. Whereas old wizards believe that magic is all about rune circles and stuffed alligators, young wizards believe it's about splitting magical particles. Old witches believe magic is mostly psychology, while young witches believe it involves harmonizing with Nature and use of crystals. And, as Granny Weatherwax would say, dancin' around without yer drawers on. All of these views happen to be correct, in one way or another.
</li><li> Necromancy, AKA Post-Mortem Communication, has a bad reputation on the Disc, yet its practitioners are formally permitted a modest degree of misbehavior under University statute. Fortunately, the allowed misconduct only rises to the level of being a bloody nuisance, hence (nowadays) not triggering outright hostility or anyone hunting down rogue necromancers with extreme prejudice. It's accepted that having someone around who (a) knows about this stuff and (b) is willing and licensed to use the occasional low blow or dirty trick in a good cause, is worth any minor annoyances. Added to that, the university having an "official" Necromancer gives them license to crack down on "unofficial" necromancers — with fireballs, if need be.
</li><li> Prior to Ridcully's administration, members of the eight Orders of Wizardry often engaged in taunting and one-upmanship between themselves. Subverted in that by the time the series hits its stride, the existence of these Orders has faded into the background, so we don't get to see what differences (if any) spurred their old rivalries. Most likely everyone who cared wiped each other out in the mage war in <em>Sourcery</em> in any case.
</li><li> All of this rivalry is rather beside the point, however, as the most powerful magic in Discworld history was that of <em>sourcerers</em>, not witches or wizards. (Witches and wizards, in different ways, manipulate the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackgroundMagicField">Background Magic Field</a> of the Discworld, sourcerers <em>radiate</em> magic.) Sourcerers' relationship to other magic-users is that they both empower them by their very presence, and scare the living crap out of them. And the most brilliant magic-user still around today isn't a human at all, but Hex, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AI">A.I.</a> which doesn't even have a gender.
</li><li> There are also lesser grades within or affiliated to wizardry: student wizards who fail their final exams are often directed to socially and professionally more lowly supporting roles such as thaumatology. If a basic degree in wizardry equates to a B.A. degree, thaumatology could be seen as the lesser HND or City and Guilds qualification. Conjuring might be, by comparison, an NVQ. Or for American readers, a community college diploma as opposed to an Ivy League degree. There's also a passing mention of "mag<em>icians</em>" being the magical equivalent of lab techn<em>icians</em>.
</li><li> Furthermore, different academic institutions at which wizards are trained have academic-style rivalries, such that the heads of Unseen, Buggarup, and Brazeneck Universities all trying to one-up one another. Among witches, regional differences between Circle Sea witchcraft and Genuan voodoo exist, but in <em>Witches Abroad</em> those differences aren't actually responsible for the conflict. While witchcraft is generally associated with rural culture, urban witches are revealed to exist in <em>I Shall Wear Midnight</em> having been hinted at in earlier books; the two styles have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMouse">Country Mouse</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityMouse">City Mouse</a> relationship.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReaperMan">Reaper Man</a></em> also parodies the arcane/divine debate with an argument between Archchancellor Ridcully and the High Priest of Blind Io (who happen to be brothers). While the two of them are throwing jovial barbs at each other, they have to stop quickly to prevent the other wizards and priests from murdering each other.
</li><li> "Conjurers" on the Discworld are stage magicians who openly admit that they don't use magic at all but sleight-of-hand and other real-world illusion techniques. It's stated at one point that wizards despise them, but that ordinary people admire them simply because they use skills that anyone can develop instead of arcane and unearned talent.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctrineOfLabyrinths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DoctrineOfLabyrinths">Doctrine of Labyrinths</a></em> world, there tends to be a different school of magic in each country, so a lot of the rivalry is tied up with politics. Most wizards don't study other schools of magic for this reason, even though they would probably be capable of more than one type of spells. Also, wizards visiting another country have to be very careful what they do—for example, in Melusine it's considered heresy to cast a spell of any kind on a person.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> divides magic into witchcraft and sorcery. Witchcraft is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RitualMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RitualMagic">Ritual Magic</a> mostly practiced by Easterners (baseline humans). Sorcery is a power anyone with citizenship in the empire can use: a powerful artifact called the Orb can be called upon mentally by anyone in Dragaera to fuel a wide variety of spells. Apparently it controls the energy/substance/<em>something</em> known as Chaos, the normally dangerously unstable power behind all magic. (The third kind of magic is <em>direct</em> manipulation of the stuff. Since it tends to get out of control and consume all in its path, trying it is a highly discouraged dead last resort.) Vlad Taltos is a user of both (and tried to command chaos once when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">Godzilla Threshold</a> had been crossed — fortunately, Aliera was there to keep it from expanding too much and leaving a Sea of Chaos where the city used to be).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonKeeperTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonKeeperTrilogy">Dragon Keeper Trilogy</a></em>: Sorcerers and Necromancers are not the same thing, not that we see much of sorcerers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em> has no formal label for practitioners of magic owing to it being extremely variable but there are some hierarchical distinctions:
<ul><li> A <em>Wizard</em> is a magical heavyweight and refers specifically to being a Wizard of the White Council and is mostly like having a PhD in magic. To make the grade one has to be capable of many types of magic as well as having substantial raw magical power then endure some formal Trial.
</li><li> A <em>Sorcerer(ess)</em> refers to a medium-weight spell slinger. They can possess considerable power and/or a range of abilities comparable to a Wizard but generally have an incomplete education in some fashion and are not members of the Council. It has also been used in the context of nonhuman magic users like vampires.
</li><li> A <em>Warlock</em> refers to a criminal of any actual ability who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">broken one of the Laws of Magic</a>, if caught by the Council they are executed (almost) without exception. Significantly this is no mere political distinction as breaking the Laws both make it easier to do so in the future and eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">makes you go mad with power</a>.
</li><li> At the bottom there are more limited talents some of whom might match a Wizard, but only in very specific areas as well as the true "have nots" who have just a smidgen of magical ability. They have no formal designation in-universe but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDresdenFiles">the RPG</a> uses "Focused Practitioner" and "Minor Talent" to refer to these characters.
</li><li> Additionally various "prefixmancer" designations (such as Ectomancers who communicate with ghosts) and other titles are used to refer to specific skill sets. Mostly for the lower end of the spectrum, but not always — an Ectomancer like Morty, for instance, is capable of things even a full wizard like Harry can't do, but everything he does is focused on that one specific skillset. Morty couldn't cast a simple fire spell to light his candles, but he <em>can</em> take on the skills and abilities of spirits on the fly.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Earthsea">Earthsea</a></em> series makes a distinction between "true" magic (based on an ancient language, studied in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a>, practiced only by men) and several lesser forms of magic, including sorcery, illusionism and village witches. There are also other forms of religious magic in different cultures.
</li><li> Iar Elterrus:
<ul><li> <em>Burden of the Emperor</em> features the conflict between the wizards and in general arcane spellcasters of the titular Empire and the priests of the setting's dominant monotheistic religion, which blooms into <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a full-scale world war involving the attempt to summon an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em>Gray Sword</em> setting: regular mages draw their power from a certain specialty, e.g. Fire, Wind or Pain. The latter grants the already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> setting a "pain counter" device, just to make sure the torturers don't cut nobody no slack.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EnchantedForestChronicles">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a></em> has:
<ul><li> Wizards: Use staves to cast magic, often grow beards, absorb magic from their surroundings to use later through their staffs, and seem to store the magic in them. Nobody likes them, especially not the main characters, dragons in general, or anyone with their own magic. They in turn don't like dragons, fire-witches, or any of the main characters.
</li><li> Magicians: Can cast a number of different spells picked up from studying a number of different sources. Often mistaken for other magic users, such as wizards, which annoys them. Innately curious about other kinds of magic, highly scientific in their studies, prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a>, these habits annoy others.
</li><li> Witches: Use cats and objects innate magic in their spells. Broomsticks are only reliable transportation for them. They get along reasonably well with other magic-users, but make it a point to keep everyone else scared enough of them to leave them alone.
</li><li> Fire-witches: Innate magic users, immune to most spells, and to fire which they have a special affinity for, can instinctively control spells, even by other casters. Wizards must be careful not to absorb their magic, the results end badly for the wizard. All fire-witches share a few personality traits and most are unpredictable but reasonably hospitable/friendly, but there are a few who are down right nasty. Most people are at least a little scared of any fire-witches they meet.
</li><li> Dragon Magic: Normally only used by dragons, a few others have picked up a few spells of this type. Not the kind of magic most people expect to see, so anyone who recognizes it will be surprised and impressed. Rare enough that there are no hard and fast rules on how its users are seen by other magic users, so they are judged more on their individual temperaments than anything else. However, they <em>definitely</em> tend to like Dragons and are seen as friendly enough that a Dragon will teach them.
</li><li> Sorceresses: Mentioned briefly as having gotten a reputation for being helpful. Now they all have to live in remote and hard to get to places to avoid being bothered all the time with requests for aid.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fablehaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Fablehaven">Fablehaven</a></em>, wizards are dragons that took human form permanently to drastically increase their magical powers, witches are mortals who have somehow learned dark magic, and magicians and warlocks are... something. The only thing known about them is that they (and witches) make up the bulk of those who claim to be wizards. The genuine article is quite rare and much more powerful. Due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">millennia-long lifespan</a>, a remnant of the immortality they possessed as dragons, they tend to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardClassic">Wizard Classic</a>.
</li><li> In Eric Nylund's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfUniverse">A Game of Universe</a></em>, the direct magic-users (Muses) are looked down upon by psychologists, who can also do magic. The Psychologists think the Muses are misusing raw mental power by wrapping it up in mysticism, but the Muses think that their powers are supernatural in origin and can't be explained by psychological means.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>:
<ul><li> Most non-Divination wizards consider Divination to be useless. Divination is described by Professor McGonagall as "one of the most imprecise branches of magic." Supporters of the subject claim that it is an inexact science that requires innate gifts, rather than something that can be easily taught academically. Those opposed claim that the subject is irrelevant and fraudulent. Sybil Trelawney, the professor of Divination, appears to be totally inept at it, as Hermione never fails to point out; in fact, Hermione drops the class as useless. Sybil's predictions are almost always wrong or obviously fraudulent, with the exception of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the two regarding Voldemort</span>, which she has no memory of, and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">prediction of Dumbledore's death</span> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince">sixth book</a>, which she herself disregards as incorrect.
</li><li> Professor Snape opens his class in the first book by discussing how many wizards fail to appreciate the subtle art and expertise that goes into mixing potions, since it involves no wand-waving or showy displays found in other magic.
</li><li> Humorously mixing this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardOnSoftScience">Hard on Soft Science</a>, Horace Slughorn is at one point seen talking to other teachers at a school party, admitting that every member of the faculty thinks <em>their</em> subject is "the most important."
</li><li> Similarly, Neville's grandmother doesn't want him to take Charms at NEWT level, viewing it as a "soft option". Professor McGonagall promptly reveals this is because she <em>failed</em> her Charms OWL.

Witches and Wizards, of course, are considered the highest of all magic users. But then you have sorcerers and sorceresses, common conjurers, alchemists (those who mix magic potions and powders), and the like. Conjurers and alchemists seem to be the lower-end.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LawrenceWattEvans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LawrenceWattEvans">Lawrence Watt-Evans</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendsOfEthshar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendsOfEthshar">The Legends of Ethshar</a></em> series has a <em>large</em> number of different types of magic, several of which are strongly opposed to one another. In-world, different experts have classified magic into between 3 (psionic, clerical, arcane) to 12 different disciplines! The main ones are (deep breath): Wizardry (rituals, requires components, taps into raw chaos, possibly the most powerful), Sorcery (use of "talismans" which appear to be some form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">ultra-advanced technology</a> such as a genetic scanner and a wand that acts as a machine gun and grenade launcher), witchcraft (psychic powers including telepathy and telekinesis, as tiring to use as doing something by hand), warlockry (a different form of psychic powers, stronger and not tiring, but as it gets stronger with use, eventually draws one to the source of the power never to be seen again; said source is either a meteor, crashed UFO, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">Lovecraftian Horror</a> that no-one can get near without becoming a warlock too powerful to resist its call), theurgy (priests call upon gods to manifest and aid them, no priest can be heard by more than a handful of gods, each only capable within their narrow specialty), demonology (calling and binding demons), and things such as herbalism, science, ritual dance, necromancy and prestidigitation have all been mentioned at one point! Clearly priests and demonologists hate one another, as do wizards and sorcerers; there was a major war which the priests and wizards won when the gods and demons took to the field themselves after 200 years of fighting. Warlocks are new and regarded with suspicion, but can work well with witches (power and precision working together) as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb">Yin-Yang Bomb</a>. *pant, pant, pant* The politics of magic is a major underlying theme of the series.
</li><li> There's a few minor cases of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicians">The Magicians</a></em>, though it takes place only at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Brakebills.</a> Intermediate students are sorted into certain groups based on their magical disciplines, and several of these groups have long-standing rivalries: for example, the Physical Kids- who practice messy physics-based wizardry- despise the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">Naturals</a> with a passion.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MatthewSwift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MatthewSwift">Matthew Swift</a></em>, though Wizards (who control magic through rules) and Sorcerers (who draw on raw magical power) get along reasonably well, they both have very little respect for Warlocks, who earn magical powers by bargaining with the various spirits in the area.
</li><li> In Delia Marshall Turner's <em>Nameless Magery</em> the protagonist, who comes from a world where magic is revered as a sentient, semi-divine force with a personality of its own, experiences culture clash when she lands on a planet where the mages fear magic and treat it as a dangerous tool that needs to be handled carefully.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SergeyLukyanenko">Sergey Lukyanenko</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> shows a more benign example - wizards, sorcerers, warlocks were originally direct spellcasters, while witches and enchanters specialized in creating powerful artefacts. As of the series' events, there are almost no pure representatives of those traditions, although the Inquisition often issues their operatives rare or obscure artefacts to give them a certain combat advantage. Witches do tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a>, which allows them to use more primal forces but also ages them to an old crone in under a decade, requiring them to maintain their youthful appearance with magic. Typically, an old witch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">will crumple to dust</a>, if her magic is taken away. Vampires and werewolves (which also includes other kinds of "weres") are special cases. They're the only type of Other, who are able to turn normal humans into Others. They are also kept at the bottom of the Other hierarchy. The Dark Others dislike them for their animalistic nature and a focus on physical strength, as opposed to magic. The Light Others don't like them, because both of those groups need to feed on human blood and meat, respectively, and the Grand Treaty forces the Night Watch to hand out hunting licenses for them using a lottery-based system to pick which humans will be sacrificed for the greater good. While vampires are typically reviled, high vampires are treated with more respect due to their experience and strength. The author also can't seem to decide whether vampires and werewolves are truly undead or not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheObsidianTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheObsidianTrilogy">The Obsidian Trilogy</a></em>: Ritualized High Magick is in conflict with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic">Wild Magic</a>. The High Mages of Armethalieh look down on Wild Mages as evil Demon-worshippers, while the elites among them hide High Magick's history as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a magic created through use of Wild Magic itself</span>. True Wild Mages are invariably good people, while many High Mages are corrupt. This probably comes from the fact that Wild Magic is mostly outside mortal control, and its spells are just deals made with the Wild Magic, while High Magick is solely in human control.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Pact">Pact</a></em>: Practitioners come in a variety of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfOneMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfOneMagic">Master of One Magic</a> flavors, but none are more feared and hated than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Diabolist</a>. This is for very good reason, as the creatures that diabolists deal with are the antithesis of creation, and each time one is brought into the world it diminishes the world as a whole-light gets a little less bright, people get a little less kind, and lucky breaks that save lives happen more infrequently.
</li><li> Vitalij Zykov's <em>Return</em> series (pentalogy to be continued): almost every culture has its own magic specialty, with free-for-all relations between states and schools of magic. Pick your flavor: tribal orc shamans, tribal human shamans, innate human wizards, academic human and dwarven wizards discriminated against by the innate ones, academic human necromancers, "light" elven life-mages (who use the proficiency at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">upkeeping life</a> for unparalleled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">torture</a>), "dark" elven conjurers and dragons who use their own flavors of arcane spells and necromancy. The world also had two sentient species, referenced as Reptarh and Reptohors, who fought to mutual annihilation. The Reptohors magic is largely unknown and forgotten, but might have specialized on interacting with mind and consiousness. The Reptarh magic, learned by the protagonist in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionBeam">Exposition Beam</a> relic, can be used to interact with and upgrade every other human magic, while being different from them.
</li><li> In R. Scott Bakker's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondApocalypse">Second Apocalypse</a></em>, all users of magic must belong to a school of sorcery. Each school approaches sorcery from a completely different angle. The schools are all essentially at war with each other for dominance, the secrets of each others' sorcery, or both. Those who are not in a school are called wizards and will be killed by any sorcerer who discovers them, making them extremely rare and short-lived. Women who use magic are called witches and are outlawed, making them also extremely rare. Sorcery is considered an abomination to religious types, but there are also magical abilities granted directly from the Gods, though these are much more nebulous. In addition, sorcery breaks down into three types:
<ul><li> The Gnosis, practised by the Mandate. It is far more powerful than the rest and its secrets hotly coveted and jealously protected. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> compares it to <em>philosophy</em>, defining the terms of reality exactly and objectively. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1xp58');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1xp58" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1xp58');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal">It might be noted that R. Scott Bakker has a degree in philosophy and thinks highly of its importance.</a></span>
</li><li> The Anagogis, practised by most Schools in the Three Seas region. It is less powerful than the Gnosis. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> compares it to <em>poetry</em>, describing reality by use of metaphors and comparison.
</li><li> The Psûkhe, practiced by the Cishaurim sorcerer-priests. It has the least raw power, but does have the benefit of being undetectable except by its effects. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> compares it to <em>music</em>, which is better at communicating emotion than concrete ideas.
</li></ul></li><li> There is quite some rivalry between Witches and Wizards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em>, especially about Mother Nature and the situations in which <strong>Magyk</strong> is to be used.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilerianTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilerianTrilogy">The Silerian Trilogy</a></em>: The Guardians (fire mages) and waterlords (water mages) are old, deadly enemies. As you'd expect, the latter is more powerful. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, by the end of the series people who have both abilities appear.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinHunger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkinHunger">Skin Hunger</a></em>, the inequality is created by Somiss, who starts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardingSchool">Wizarding School</a> that is only for boys from wealthy families. After he achieves this, there seem to be no female magic users at all, while beforehand, most magicians were female and/or ethnic minority. The teaching methods are also very different - while people used to learn their magic spells from their mothers in everyday life, (and Sadima was just born with the ability to communicate with animals, no training required), Somiss established a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchoolOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchoolOfHorrors">Boarding School of Horrors</a> where one of nine boys becomes a proper, privileged wizard, while the others ... are implied to die. They are actively discouraged from helping each other, and not given food. The only food they get to eat is that which they can produce by magic ... without any education on how to achieve this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends">Star Wars Legends</a></em> books feature Force users who are <em>not</em> Jedi Knights. They have some very different ideas about what the Force is or how to use it, and some of them have fallen under condemnation from both the Jedi Council and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> because of it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods">The War Gods</a></em> features several forms of magic.
<ul><li> Wand Wizards use tools to manipulate the magical field, require extensive training and must be human or half-human. They made up the aristocratic class of the old Empire, and the white wizards were all but killed off in the Fall. Black wizards are alive and well, and 'won' Kontovar. They act as a villain for the story. Wencit is the only White Wizard around in the story today, but he's also a wild wizard.
<ul><li> The difference between 'Black' and 'White' wizards is in how they gather power and the use they put their magic to. Black wizards make large use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a>, sacrificing people to fuel their spells. White wizards are sworn not to use blood magic (unless the other person consents to it) and not to use magic as a weapon except against other wizards.
</li></ul></li><li> Wild Wizards are able to be trained as Wand Wizards, but also have their own internal link to the magic field which allows them to manipulate magic at a much more basic level. Only three are described so far, Wencit, the Emperor Ottovar, who ended the Wizard Wars, and Prince Herrick, who caused the Fall of Kontovar. They also live a much longer life, although not immortal.
</li><li> Mages are able to manipulate the magic field internally to produce powers, they are much more limited in power and versatility than Wand Wizards, but in numbers quite useful.
</li><li> Clerics and champions channel the power of their god, provided they have their favor. Their own strength is essential to this, although evil can cheat by using human sacrifices to summon (the good guys can use this to cheat as well but since killing innocents would obviously lose the favor of their gods this generally takes the form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>).
</li><li> Elves used to be warlocks, able to use magic naturally, but were very prone to darkness. They were weaker than wand wizards, but required a lot less training. After the Wizard Wars Empress Gwynytha crafted the spell which changed how they accessed the magical field to give them immortality at the cost of their magic.
<ul><li> Witches and Warlocks do still exist but are a <strong>lot</strong> weaker than the pre-immortality Elves were. Most of them don't even realize that they're using magic and just think they have some unusual ability.
</li></ul></li><li> The other races have different connections as well, mostly preventing them having magic (except for cleric/champion magic). The Dwarves can do psionic stonework. Hradani have the rage as well as strength and speed. Halfings...
</li></ul></li><li> All the different cultures in Robert Jordan's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> have different ideas on how to handle magic: Aes Sedai, Aiel Wise Ones, Seanchan damane and sul'dam, and so on. All think that their way is the Only Way, and that the other cultures' ways are stupid, criminal and/or dangerous. The attitude to male magicians - a necessary evil, or plain evil? - causes a deep split within the Aes Sedai, and the power struggle between different Ajahs may also count.
<ul><li> Furthermore, male and female spellcasting are similar in principle, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmonyVersusDiscipline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmonyVersusDiscipline">feel entirely different</a>. Female spellcasters embrace their source of magic and exist in harmony with it, whereas men must seize their source and constantly struggle with it (and that's even when it's <em>not</em> corrupted with pure evil). Similar spells can work on entirely different principles - a man teleports by forcing apart a gap in the fabric of the universe, whereas a woman teleports by blending together two places until they overlap, and each describes the other method as "impossible". Finally, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YinYangBomb">two types of magic used together are orders of magnitude more powerful than either used separately</a>.
<ul><li> There are also differences in power levels, men are on average stronger but can't combine their powers without women, women are on average individually less powerful but can form circles of up to 13 women (and a circle of 13 women can overpower any male channeler even if individually the women can barely channel at all, though 13 men would probably win, even if they couldn't circle). Additionally strength in the different types of magic varies between the genders, men tend to be more powerful with Earth and Fire magic while women are more powerful with Water and Air (the fifth type, Spirit, has minimal variation between genders).
</li><li> Another interesting difference is that cats hate male channelers and love female channelers while dogs are the opposite.
</li></ul></li><li> The Aes Sedai vs. Wise Ones vs. Windfinder vs. damane split - that is, the place of female channelers in society - is just an instance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureClash">Culture Clash</a>, which the series is full of. The different methods required for male vs. female magic is a better example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites">Unequal Rites</a>, as are the varying approaches to all the non-channeling kinds of magic out there, particularly foresight: wolfbrothers, Foretellings, Dreaming and Min's viewings. We have never seen anyone use more than one of the above and no one agrees on how reliable any of them are.
<ul><li> Also not helping at all is the sheer size of the ego of everyone involved, and their inability to admit that they <em>might</em> be wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> There's also something of a direct conflict between natural dream-walkers (most of them wolves rather than humans) and channeler dream-walkers, and the channelers tend to deride the wolf-blooded as inferior at best, monsters at worst.
</li><li> Also worth noting is luck/fate magic, which usually functions as passive plot armor to the person possessing it, causing them to regard it as something mundane to the point of barely being magical at all, whereas everyone that's not the actual possessor of the magic tends to have their life spontaneously rearranged in disproportionate ways (your wife leaves you and you're raped by a roving pack of demons so that the hat you drop falls in a puddle and keeps a luck mage from accidentally getting his boot wet) so you get a running debate between the one guy that thinks the power's no big deal and the thousands upon thousands that are pretty sure it qualifies him as a god.
</li></ul></li><li> Alexey Pehov's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WindAndSparks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WindAndSparks">Wind and Sparks</a></em> series occurs as the two-millennia conflict between the white (arcane, hermetic) and the black (priest-like necromantic) schools erupts into yet another continent-spanning war. Plus there's a ritualistic red school which could have abstained from the conflict, but supported the whites. Technically, the empire housing the white school wins, but the gray school- which actually gave birth to the white and black one- is reborn.
</li><li> Wizards of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheWitcher">the Witcherworld</a> tend to look down on priests, considering their power to be just magic achieved through mysticism and meditation rather than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA">training</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTravelersGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTravelersGate">The Traveler's Gate</a></em>: Most Travelers look down on other Territories, but Grandmaster Naraka in particular looks down on Valinhall, dismissing it as an "artificial" Territory that was created a mere sixty years ago. Since Valinhall Travelers are <em>very</em> good at killing other Travelers, part of this might be simple animal fear.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AnArchdemonsDilemmaHowToLoveYourElfBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AnArchdemonsDilemmaHowToLoveYourElfBride">An Archdemon's Dilemma: How to Love Your Elf Bride</a></em>, a few lucky humans are born with sorcery. Sorcery is general-purpose, but each sorcerer has one innate specialty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalityPowers">usually based on their personality</a>. They need book learning to do anything complex (so there's quite a market for sorcery blueprints) and mana to power their spells. Mysticism is what albinos- of all species- have. It is entirely intuitive, much more powerful than sorcery, not hindered by any of the limitations mentioned above, and isn't affected by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">anti-sorcery collars</a> either. However, most albinos in the setting don't live to adulthood because criminals butcher them for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">Human Resources</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WizardOfYurt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WizardOfYurt">Wizard of Yurt</a></em>: There's tension between wizards who use magic (deemed "natural") vs. clergy and evildoers invoking saints or demons (i.e. the "supernatural"). Both wizards and clergy are taught they're incompatible. Many clerics are suspicious about magic, thinking it's often the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkArts">black arts</a>" (although wizards don't believe in such a concept-intent is what matters). Wizards on the other hand often resent religious strictures.

<ul><li> Characters who use spells with the Evil descriptor are probably going to be viewed with suspicion at best by those on the upper third of the alignment spectrum. Necromancy can get a similar reaction due to assumptions of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">Bad Powers, Bad People</a>, which caused problems when 3rd Edition classified the ubiquitous <em>cure ___ wounds</em> spells as Necromancy - the spell family has since been classified as evocations.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://i.redd.it/8j68feoo6rp01.png">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> story tells of a player playing a solo campaign as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersGoodPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersGoodPeople">heroic necromancer</a> who travelled to lands ruled by cruel tyrants and taught the people there necromancy so they could overthrow their oppressors, instill democracy, and once all that was over and done with, have the undead thralls do all of the menial labor so that the living had all the time in the world to pursue their true passions. On his deathbed, he used a scrying spell to check up on all of the places he had been to for nostalgia's sake, and to his horror found that a group of heroes had been going around "saving" these lands from the "evil necromancer" and reinstating their tyrannical rulers due to an assumption of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadPowersBadPeople">necromancer bad</a>". <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">They also called him the "Arch-Lich", which offended him as he was not a lich and had no plans to become one</a>.

Turns out the player was not playing a solo campaign at all, but was secretly being used as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of another campaign without either party's knowledge. The DM said he played his part beautifully.
</li></ul></li><li> Beyond Necromancy, the other subschools of magic a Wizard can specialize in can have their own rivalries: Abjurists looking down on Evokers for being too destructive, Diviners disdaining Illusionists for creating falsehoods rather than revealing truth, Conjurers sneering at Enchanters for forcing others to fight for them rather than summoning a like-minded ally, and so forth.
</li><li> Wizards are spellcasters who must endure years of unwavering discipline and intense magical study before they can cast even the simplest of spells. Sorcerers have no training, just an innate talent for magic that manifests naturally — and which they may or may not care to control. The two radically different approaches may cause the two groups to bicker or even war against each other, depending on the setting.
</li><li> Wild Mages, when first introduced in <em>Advanced D&amp;D</em>, were generally looked upon with scorn, distrust or other negative feelings by other magic users. This is because Wild Mages use a unique form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyAndChaosMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntropyAndChaosMagic">Entropy and Chaos Magic</a>, which makes their spells have a significant chance of failing and exploding in a "wild surge" instead of working as intended. Wild surges are always chaotic, with results that can be anything from funny, to annoying, to potentially deadly. Needless to say, other wizards look down on wild mages both for their inability to retain control and for the practical reason that nobody really likes someone who has a chance of randomly hurling around fireballs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender">Gender Benders</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">clouds of rainbow bubbles</a> whenever they try to use even the mildest form of magic.
<ul><li> Wild mages get it particularly bad in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em>, where their magic was born after the brutal death of the local Goddess of Magic and so they are often hated as heretics, blasphemers or religious profaners by both more devout wizards and by the deity's clergy.
</li></ul></li><li> Warlocks get their spellcasting powers through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">archfey</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">outsider</a>, or...), whether by the Warlock themself or an ancestor. This tends to make them feared by common folk and disdained by the likes of wizards who had to work for their powers.
</li><li> The Adept is a spellcasting class meant for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPC">NPCs</a>, meaning that it's quite lacking when compared to a proper player class, and likewise "professional" mages in a setting are going to look down upon such "amateurs."
</li><li> The subclass of wizards called witches, who are regarded as a more primitive form of wizardry. Depending on the setting, wizards may consider them savages and a few gods jealous of their powers that they ordered members of their churches to hunt them down.
</li><li> Divine spellcasters and arcane casters occasionally come into conflict. Clerics get their spells by praying to their deity, and thus can view arcanists as godless heathens or heretics, while mages may sneer at clerics for being "given" powers instead of working for them. There's a fair number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Classes</a> with a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWitchHunter">Witch Hunter</a>" theme and abilities to help them combat arcane spellcasters.
</li><li> Within the divine ranks, there can be friction between Druids who practice "natural" magic and more civilized Clerics, and between Clerics and classes like Favored Souls, who are similar to Sorcerers in that their magic comes from their force of personality rather than rigorous study.
</li><li> The Binder class may get it the worst of all. These <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler">Willing Channelers</a> get their powers by forming pacts with beings called Vestiges that are less than gods but more than mortal. Wizards look down on them as lazy, foolish, or cheaters, but they are outright <em>despised</em> by divine casters, who consider them blasphemers and heretics for bowing to false gods. The default assumption is that any setting with Binders is going to have organizations devoted to hunting them down, such as the Order of Seropaenes, an (unholy?) alliance between the usually-opposed churches of Heironeous, St. Cuthbert, Wee Jas and Vecna. When followers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> god of valor and chivalry are working with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralEvil">Neutral Evil</a> god of dark knowledge to come after you, you know you have a PR problem.
</li><li> Psionicists tend to clash with more conventional spellcasters, since a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting">Standard Fantasy Setting</a> is usually ill-equipped to deal with something as "sci-fi" as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Psychic Powers</a>. Sometimes this extends to the rules, so that creatures with a resistance to magic have no defenses against psionics, while other times psionics are treated no differently than spells.
</li><li> There can be a divide between dedicated spellcasting classes like Wizards and Clerics, and hybrid (or "dabbler") classes like Bards or Rangers that are much less capable with magic, both in-setting or around the tabletop.
</li><li> And finally, there are a great many Prestige Classes built around defying this trope and blending various types of magic: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">Mystic Theurges</a> who master scholarly wizardry and divine contemplation, Fochlucan Lyricists who combine the magic of bardic music and druidic secrets, Cerebremancers who cast arcane spells and manifest psionic powers, Anima Mages who supplement their arcane spellcasting with the power of a bound Vestige, etc.
<ul><li> Interestingly, Anima Mages are hated even by other Binders because they mercilessly exploit vestiges to enhance their spellcasting, an act which makes them unable to be good aligned.

They can use True Magic, much like wizards in other settings. All others can only become Magicians and outside Illusion and Divination schools use only minor spells.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> has four types of main magic users: Wizards of High Sorcery, Clerics of the gods, Primal Sorcerers, and Mystics. The Wizards do not get along with the Sorcerers a lot of the time because the Wizards see the Sorcerers as infringing on their territory. The relationship between Mystics and Clerics of good deities is more friendly because of the Citadel of Light, which has both Mystics and Clerics working together to help people. Clerics of Neutral and Evil deities view of Mystics often depends on how their deity feels about Mysticism. And Wizards and Clerics sometimes do not get along because a Cleric, the last Kingpriest of Istar, was the one who tried to kill all Wizards on Ansalon prior to the Cataclysm. And since Wizards of High Sorcery are moon-dependent, there are three sorts of <em>them</em> — one per Krynnish moon. There's also the "renegade" category, which is where wizards who refuse to acknowledge the authority of the orders of High Sorcery are classified. Mostly, it's a place to file wizardly characters or classes that get imported from other game-settings.

</li><li> Psionics are generally looked down upon for having made up a whole new way to imagine magic works that is more restrictive and less useful than any of the accepted theories of mana with no actual advantages (Although thought forms, their conjured spirit equivalent, are free to summon, summon in one action and, unlike nature spirits, are not restricted to one area).
</li><li> Full magicians, who can use both sorcery (casting spells) and conjuration (summoning, binding, and controlling spirits), tend to look down on adepts who are limited to one or the other. There are also <em>physical</em> adepts, whose magic is tuned toward augmenting their body and mind in various ways, which leads to most people thinking of them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">street-sams</a> without the chrome.

Consequently, they tend to get a bit peeved when "primitive outsiders" pull off stunts that their own Art can't replicate. Different Houses within the Order aren't immune either: the Faerie based spells used by House Merinita get a measure of distrust, and House Verditius' inability to cast spells without special tools gets them something of a bad rap.

For the Slann, the most powerful wizards in the world who taught the elves their thing, magic comes as naturally as breathing.
</li><li> In addition to the species/racial differences, there also exists an arcane/divine dichotomy throughout, well, pretty much every civilised realm. In Bretonnia and parts of the Empire, for example, wielding arcane magic is grounds for a burning/hanging/impalement/decapitation/other execution method, but the miracles a priest performs aren't a problem (or aren't considered magical). Well, in the Empire using arcane magic without the training and sanction of the colleges is grounds for execution full stop, but certain peasants and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">prea</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChurchMilitant">chers</a> haven't quite got that message.

Those that are found are captured and put in the Inquisition's Black Ships and sent to Terra, where a thousand psykers are sacrificed daily so the Emperor's psychic beacon doesn't collapse (which would make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FTLTravel">FTL Travel</a> impossible). Those that aren't suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> in order to control their powers, and undergo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to develop them.

<ul><li> During the Horus Heresy a more traditional form of this feuding occurred among the Librarius.

<ul><li> Except it turned out that the White Scars' version of Librarians called Stormseers used their planets world soul. Fenris has no confirmed world soul and the Fang, headquarters of the Space Wolves, has the screaming souls of former inhabitants embedded in its surface. Also, the Thousand Sons practiced a stable form of sorcery, which anyone can do, and they used psykers. Chaos sorcery involves entreating with Chaos, which the Thousand Sons did not do (but Magnus did without realizing it). Besides that, a strictly ordered and regimented form of sorcery would not be dangerous. It's how the Eldar keep their power use clean of Chaos.

However, the societies, conspiracies or organizations that practice them look at each other with nothing but scorn and make learning more than one <em>really</em> hard for applicants.
</li><li> The rivalry between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mages</a>, Tremere, Giovanni and Harbingers of Skulls/Cappadocians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> is particularly illustrative. The Tremere were formerly Mages and made a vampire copy of their old powers (weak and blood fueled, but still), the Giovanni accuse the Tremere of stealing their necromancy from them, while the Harbingers/Cappadocians <em>did</em> have theirs stolen by the Giovanni.
</li><li> Since it runs on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> reality, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em> is fueled by this trope. Magical wars are fought over convincing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Sleepers</a> that your faction's mystical philosophy is the correct one, some factions even claiming that their enemies use corrupted forms of their own mysticism. The funniest example is the Sons of Ether, who were a member of the non-player antagonist faction until said faction decided to go with light being a self-propagating wave instead of have a medium (the aforementioned Ether). Because the Sons really enjoyed being able to do things like wind-surf through the vacuum of space, this led to a violent rebellion and them joining the protagonist faction.

The former is practiced by the Lancea Sanctum, an unholy church based off of Catholicism which sees humans as sinful, that vampires can never be saved, and that it is their duty to apply a masquerade friendly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">Scare 'Em Straight</a> to humanity. Cruac on the other hand is practiced by the Circle of the Croan, an essentially pagan offshoot that sees vampires as divine and that they must be unbound. Most often both attempt to persecute and purge the other for "getting it wrong". Then add the Ordo Dracul into the mix, who in fact would <em>love</em> to learn everything about Cruac and Theban Sorcery possible so they can advance their study of the Coils of the Dragon. Essentially, taking the Suck out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> via rigorous scientific(ish) study without a care for the religion of either.

The miracles somewhat resembling "divine spells" were even only introduced late in the 3rd edition.
<ul><li> Magic users break into separate schools depending on how they were taught, including guild mages (academic, logical), elves (intuitive), witches (emotion-based), druids, illusionists, shamans and others around the edges.
</li><li> Most of those groups can learn spells, most easily those familiar to their own school, though there are many spells known in more than one, and in addition has special rituals not available to the others—a mage can learn certain enchantments for a staff, a witch can learn curses, and so on. Most groups also have philosophy-based restrictions (e.g. mages have responsibilities to their guild, druids can't work magic while touching iron, lizardmen need a material focus for each spell).
</li><li> The bigger schools are split according to attitudes/philosophies further. There are three guilds for mages—white, grey, and black—with one of the main differences being their attitude to demonology. Witches may have greater cohesion, but the sisterhoods, determined by the species of their familiar, which is tied to their personality, have their differences. Druids are split into those focusing on mind magic, and those focused on elementarism.
</li></ul></li><li> The five colors of magic in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> all have at least one thing in common: They consider their way to be the only <em>right</em> one, two of the other colors are agreeable, if a bit misguided, and the last two are just <em>dead wrong</em>. A prime example would be Blue, the color of knowledge, respects Black for its ambition and desire for control and White for its diligence and drive for order. Green and Red, on the other hand, are mindless and savage and should either be locked down or eliminated. Of course, this is the abstract version of color philosophies: with actual organizations and people it gets more complicated, but the trope remains in force.
<ul><li> The rabbit hole can go even deeper when you start getting groups/people with dual color affiliations like the guilds in Ravnica some of which are two colors normally opposite on the spectrum such as White/Black who abide by very strict contracts and will use any means to enforce them or punish anyone who doesn't hold up their end of the contract. They consider basically the entire rest of the guilds as marks to be conned out of everything they own.
</li><li> Things get really weird when you mix even more colors. Cards that require all five colors to cast are some of the most powerful in the game since they embody unification and cooperation between all five of the color philosophies. They are also relatively difficult to play due to their casting costs. This symbolizes that making the five colors cooperate is <em>hard</em>.

Firstly, ngangas are people born with the inherent ability to control ashe, the fundamental energy of the universe, through the use of talismans and ritual. Secondly, the marabouts are people who have been granted the blessing of the spirits and can work miracles by calling on their aid. Generally speaking, marabout magic is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">subtler and more elegant</a> (it has to work within the natural order, but the details are handled by spirits who know exactly what they're doing), while nganga magic is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">more powerful but cruder</a> (it can theoretically do anything, but is limited by the nganga's ability to figure out how). The griots form a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaybeMagicMaybeMundane">possible</a> third school, since they can empower, weaken or even strike down others with their songs, but that might be because the authority of griots is so well-respected in the Three Lands that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourMindMakesItReal">Your Mind Makes It Real</a>.

</li><li> Cats have an innate ability to absorb the powers of human relics they've studied and broken, anathama to the Man-worshiping dogs. Mancers absorb the same sort of relic used by Artisans during their initiation, and thenafter channel their internalized power through a focus crafted from bones, and unlike dogs they have no qualms against casting "unnatural" magics like necromancy, even if it causes some theological arguments with Ministers. Ministers on the other hand have their power chanted into them by existing Ministers, so they only require their voice to cast spells. A third type of spellcaster, dabblers, are members of other classes that pick up a bit of spellcasting later on, but they need both a bone focus and their voice to cast.

They are right, but mages think that <em>they</em> are using magic responsibly (and at least a few of them really are), and the former are just luddite fools, and the real villains are Warlocks, Necromancers and Death Knights.

Meanwhile, the power-mad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">Tevinter Magisters</a>, who permit the usage of blood magic within their borders, are looked on with a mixture of fear and disgust; Circle Mages will collaborate with them for research projects- especially in the more esoteric fields- but that's about as far as they're prepared to trust them.
<ul><li> Orthodox Circle Mages also have a less-than-cordial relationship with Apostates- mages outside the control of the Circle and the Chantry- viewing them as potential maleficars, from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">nature magic-wielding</a> Dalish Keepers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryShapeshifting">shapeshifters</a> like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Morrigan</a> and Flemeth. Even the relatively innocuous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Hawke</a> family isn't exempt. On the other hand, many factions within the Circles cooperate semi-openly with apostates, either because they oppose the Templars' control over the Circle or because they simply see apostates as the Templars' problem.
</li><li> Even the Circle itself isn't exempt from this sort of thing, having divided itself into a number of different Fraternities with different ideas as to how mages should be governed and how they should use magic... and then, in the Witch Hunt expansion pack it's possible to find a book on Spirit Magic that's been hopelessly vandalized by a proponent of Entropy Magic.
</li><li> and of course, pretty much all of the above mentioned mages bag low opinions of Rivani Seers and Avvar augurs, who practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingChanneler">communion</a> with benevolent spirits.

</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> IV this is why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Protagonist</a> of the Death campaign refuses to expand his kingdom after fighting tooth and nail to get it.

He's all too aware that his brand of magic doesn't have a very good reputation.
</li><li> The necromancer/wizard split was not the only division in the old setting — interestingly, the part of the description where the wizard sneers at the cleric is averted. Instead, it is the philosophical divisions <em>within</em> the categories of spell-users that inspire rivalry: Archdruids (Druids that have deepened their commitment to nature) and Warlocks (Druids that seek power) tend to clash, Priests of Light (Clerics aligned with the Path of Light) and Priests of Dark (Clerics aligned with the Path of Dark) are adherents to mutually opposed religions and Necromancers by definition are opposed to the Path of Light while Wizards tends to support it. Things were more relaxed in the country of Enroth (where archmages and priests were even known to sometimes learn <em>both</em> associated schools of magic with the Paths of Light and Dark), and put in sharper contrast on the continent of Jadame (which was lacking in Light-aligned sorcerers and Dark-aligned clerics, and had a full-scale <em>war</em> between the Church of the Sun<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5u1r7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5u1r7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5u1r7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a more militant faith from which the modern Path of Light evolved, but which remained predominant in some regions around the world</span> and the Necromancer's Guild).

Oddly while there is the odd reference to demon/devils the class text say their power comes from their own souls, not pacts with residents of other realms.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheReconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheReconstruction">The Reconstruction</a></em> combines this with good old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Shra</a> can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalBaggage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalBaggage">summon fire or ice from nowhere</a>, so humans tend not to acknowledge that their ability to manipulate what's already around them is for all intents and purposes magic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>, the Miracle wielding clerics view soul arts as an abomination. The pracitioners of soul arts dislike clerics for trying to hold them back and treating them like pariahs. The clerics aren't exactly wrong to dislike soul arts though — it's a dangerous power fueled by the souls of the dead that comes from the Old One itself, and the world is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> because people abused soul arts in the past. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's heavily implied that the god the clerics worship <em>is</em> the Old One (though they aren't aware of this), which would mean that the "miracles" (which are also fueled by souls) are just soul arts with a more "benevolent" flavor to them.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI">Dark Souls</a></em>, other spellcasters look down on pyromancy, considering it to be primitive and unsavoury, which the player's initial teacher in the subject admits is true, to a point. In fact, said teacher came to the Undead-infested kingdom of Lordran in part because it is literally the only place in the world where pyromancers are respected to some extent.
</li><li> By the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em>, pyromancy appears to have lost its "primitive" stigma and is now a respected school of magic alongside the others, but each significant kingdom in the game seems to look down on one particular school and those that practice it. Drangleic looks down on miracles, preferring scholarly pursuits such as sorcery (this might have had something to do with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the king's brother, himself a scholar, discovering that Gwyn was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">Jerkass God</a> extraordinaire whose fear of humanity's power over the Dark caused him to try and seal it with the Darksign, unintentionally creating the Curse of the Undead</span>). The only prominent cleric in Drangleic was Velstadt, one of the king's two right-hand men. The extremely religious kingdom of Shulva focused on miracles and shunned sorcery, and is implied to be Velstadt's homeland. The Old Iron King's kingdom focused on pyromancy, but it isn't known what they thought about other schools of magic. Meanwhile, hexers seem to think their spells are superior to all other no matter what land they come from, and they have a point, since hexes are more difficult to use than other schools of magic, requiring investment in both Intelligence and Faith.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em>, Karla, a witch specializing in Dark sorceries, disparages miracles since she hates the holier-than-thou clerics who tend to use them. However, with some prodding, she will reluctantly accept tomes containing Dark miracles of Londor and the Cathedral of the Deep. The actual miracle teacher, Irina, will accept the tomes as well, but really doesn't want to teach their contents to you since she is afraid of becoming corrupted, which will happen if you buy even one Dark miracle from her. For the same reason, pyromancy teacher Cornyx flat-out refuses to accept the pyromancy tome containing Dark pyromancies, requiring you to take it to Karla instead.

</li><li> Another in-game book that looks at this subject is "Response to Bero's Speech". Bero, an illusionist, thinks poorly of the Destruction School of magic and gives a speech arguing that it should be treated as a sub-school within the the Alteration School instead of a school in its own right. The battlemage Malvisor responds by writing a treatise that points out multiple fallacies in Bero's arguments, argues an illusionist has no place criticising a school he hasn't studied for himself and takes a few snipes against Bero and his favored school of magic in the process:

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SixAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SixAges">Six Ages</a></em>, also set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RuneQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RuneQuest">Glorantha</a> but many eons before <em>King of Dragon Pass</em> takes place, the Hyalorings give shamans and priests roughly equal respect, allowing both to be leaders and even clan chiefs. This causes a bit of confusion and suspicion with neighbors who practice one kind of magic rather than both. And then there's the Antler Society, a new shamanic movement whose practitioners work, act, and dress drastically different from traditional shamans. These differencesand especially the fact that the insular Antlers are loyal to each other before the clan as a wholecan cause strife in a clan.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> features at least three distinct types of supernatural power. The first is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Aura</a>, a manifestation of one's soul, which is widely known about to the point where it isn't considered "supernatural" in-universe, and can be used by anyone with enough training to protect themselves from harm and gain a minor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>. There is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">magic</a>, which has ancient, divine origins and is much less widely known about, and can only be used by eight known people on the planet. Finally, there are the Grimm, physics- and biology-defying abominations that reproduce in pits of annihilatory slime and have no souls, and have no publicly-known source; they are explicitly able to defy the Law of Conservation of Energy, and no mortal scholar can figure out why.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder7');">    Webcomics </div><div class="folder" id="folder7" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Since its world is based on DnD 3.5 rules, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick">The Order of the Stick</a></em> has the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnequalRites">Unequal Rites</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a></em>, Xykon is looked down upon often by wizards for his being a sorcerer, which, naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">pisses him off</a>. Since this is Xykon, these people tend not to live much longer. Especially notable when Dorukan is fighting Xykon and at one point asserts the superiority of his wizardry to Xykon's sorcery. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Xykon responds by casting Energy Drain every turn, while giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HannibalLecture">Hannibal Lecture</a> about the advantages of spontaneous casting.</span> At the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a></em>, Xykon is told that sorcery is like a rubber mallet, whilst wizardry is a finely crafted watch. At the end, Xykon says that he'd much rather have the sledgehammer than the watch.
<ul><li> Some of his frustration stems from the fact that, while it's never stated in as many words, Xykon himself is <em>not stupid</em>, nor wholly reliant upon brute force, even though his magic isn't as complex as that of research-dependent wizards. In a setting where wizards often waste time looking for <em>exactly</em> the right spell, Xykon uses complex sequences of spells to achieve effects that no single spell can manage (such as using energy drains to de-level someone to the point of losing a level-dependent immunity, then hitting them right in the newly-exposed weakness, or using spells to draw fire to drain resources or open up a counter-attack, or even physically beating someone when the situation calls for it). He wins the vast majority of victories simply by <em>using what he has</em>, rather than trying to grasp for an ideal solution that he lacks.
</li><li> Wizards looking down on sorcerers becomes a recurring theme for the strip, and especially for Xykon — in contrast to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">dangerously obsessive</a> V who believes researching arcane magic is be-all and end-all, Xykon figures the power you have is the power you use, and power you can't use is worthless. Incidentally, the page quote references the incident shown in the picture — it was a response to another forumite wondering why Vaarsuvius would be insulted at being called a sorcerer or warlock. Vaarsuvius also expresses disdain for divine magic for about the same reasons they're disdainful of warlocks.
<div class="indent"><strong>Vaarsuvius:</strong> How should I know how long divine spells take to cast? It's not as if they were <em>real</em> magic!
</div></li></ul></li><li> Infernomancers, who get their powers via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Deal with the Devil</a> bargains, don't have a very good reputation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DominicDeegan">Dominic Deegan</a></em>. While Infernomancers were employed by Callan in the Callan-Maltak war, they were eventually hunted down by the kingdom's holy knights after they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness">outlived their usefulness</a>. There is a reason Infernomancers tend to practice their magic in secret. It doesn't help that Infernomancers deal with literal forces of evil who prey upon the greedy/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">vulnerable</a>.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Necromancers</a> also get a rather bad rep for the usual reasons, although the first necromancer (who's actually still around) is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkIsNotEvil">Dark Is Not Evil</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>.
</li><li> Meanwhile, Maltak orcs have their own shamanistic nature magic, split in two traditions: life-affirming akta and death-linked nakta. Practitioners of one type don't get along with those of the other, and while the akta-using clan used their powers in the aftermath of a magical catastrophe to make their lands a fertile haven in the wasteland of their homeland, the natka-using one went on the warpath and violently attacked any and all trespassers in orc lands, even an aid caravan from sympathetic humans. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, things are not what they appear...</span>

There are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">magical girls</a>, whose power comes from power items, and born mages, who have their powers since birth and usually dont need any additional artifacts. Other magic users consider magical girls system to be "cheating", mostly because it lets them survive as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">depowered humans</a>, when their transformed form is killed. The fact that the mages are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> and the magical girls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysLawfulGood">Always Lawful Good</a>, doesnt help at all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MagickChicks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MagickChicks">Magick Chicks</a></em>, the goddess of witches Hecate really doesn't like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">magical girls</a> for some reason. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is bad news for Melissa Hellrune, since she's a witch who recently became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> after acquiring a mysterious wand.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Erfworld">Erfworld</a></em>:
<ul><li> There is rivalry between the various disciplines and eight schools of magic, based on combinations of the elements Life, Matter, and Motion. Many Casters view the world only through the lens of their discipline, such as believing that the world is largely Foolamancy (a position not necessarily advanced by Foolamancers themselves) to believing that the world is all Numbers to numerous other variations.
</li><li> Notably, Dame Olive Branch looked down on any caster whose magic did not include Life in its make-up. She argues with Wanda, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Necromancer">Croakamancer</a>, in which some interesting points are made. Despite being much older and stronger than Wanda, she ends up coming off as the <em>loser</em> of an argument about the value of life. Olive's narcissism, poor arguing skills and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her actual low regard for life</span> presumably all teamed up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and had her poison her side's casters with Heroine buds, despite them being her side's greatest strength.</span>
<div class="indent"><strong>Olive:</strong> <em>[holding a plant]</em> You think this is just an object, don't you? It's not. It's a living thing. Like you and me. But you think we're all objects, too. Right? Look what you do with a person, when the Life is gone. That is an object, Wanda. Not this. <br/><strong>Wanda:</strong> Not true. That plant is scenery, inventory, provisions. <br/><strong>Olive:</strong> It's not— <br/><strong>Wanda:</strong> ... Or ... a piece of terrain. But this unit can move, fight, follow orders. This unit has Motion, and that is something a <em>Hippiemancer</em> would know nothing of. <br/><strong>Olive:</strong> No, you don't know what you're talking about. Yes sure, there is Motion. But it's less important than Life. That ought to be perfectly obvious to any living being. <br/><strong>Wanda:</strong> Says the Florist. The three Elements were created equal. Are you a Titan, to say otherwise? <br/><strong>Olive:</strong> I'm alive, to say otherwise. Life is the most important thing in the world. Would you want to lose your Life? <br/><strong>Wanda:</strong> No, but I wouldn't want to lose my Motion, either. I wouldn't want to be that plant. I'm no tree. Speaking of which, where is my brother?
</div></li><li> As a general rule, most casters seem to consider Croakamancy to be distasteful and unnatural. Carnymancy is also disliked, considered cheating by many. There are hints that Hippiemancy is considered useless, which makes sense for a magic centered around peace in a world almost literally made for eternal war. (Although the experiences Wanda and Jillian had with Olive Branch proved that theory wrong in some of the most horrific ways possible.) Dirtamancers occupy a strange niche: They're often considered creeps, but they're also so fantastically useful in the Magic Kingdom that they easily end up filthy rich and high in status anyway.
</li><li> Perhaps the epitome of this mindset are the Thinkamancers, who consider their discipline holy and all others "just" magic. They've made themselves self-appointed guardians of all magic and its secrets (what with being telepaths and enablers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">caster fusions</a>) and will kill or cripple anyone who even comes <em>close</em> to finding out a single secret of Thinkamancy, or does something as obscene as researching how Thinkamancy could, for example, collaborate with Dollamancy.

Ironically, Duane happens to be a "tacit caster," a rare individual who can cast spells without speaking the magic words, which his opponent considers unfair and somewhat unnatural.
