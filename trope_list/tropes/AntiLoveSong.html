This medicine comes in several flavors:
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHateSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IHateSong">The hate song</a>, where you croon about your heart-breaking desire to kill somebody.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">The overdone song</a>, where the lyrics get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurpleProse">so purple</a> you have to laugh.
</li><li> The subliminal message song, which sounds like a love song... at first.
</li><li> The weird context song, where you sing a straight love song, in circumstances that really don't fit.
</li><li> The mocking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitch">Bait-and-Switch</a> song, where you sing to the person about how they are truly and wholeheartedly loved for all their character flaws by... well, someone who certainly isn't you.
</li></ul><p>It is likely that the subliminal song will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">misunderstood</a> by at least half of the people who hear it, who will think it's a straight love song. This is especially true of advertisers, who will often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RepurposedPopSong">use it without realizing what the lyrics mean</a>.
</p><p>On the other hand, some people get the joke and love it so much that they still use it unironically.

Look at Kelly Clarkson's "Since U Been Gone": it's a break-up song, and it talks about how happy and free she is now, so it must go here, right? Wrong. It's not humorous, and it's not a parody of a love song. This is about music with some humor about it, even if it's black humor.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TomLehrer">Tom Lehrer</a> was the pioneer and undisputed master of the Anti-Love Song. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, in his albums <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsByTomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SongsByTomLehrer">Songs by Tom Lehrer</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnEveningWastedWithTomLehrer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AnEveningWastedWithTomLehrer">An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer</a></em>, he traumatized generations with songs like:
<ul><li> "When You Are Old and Gray":
<div class="indent"><em>Since I still appreciate you <br/>Let's find love while we may <br/>Because I know I'll hate you <br/>When you are old and gray</em>
</div></li><li> "I Hold Your Hand in Mine":
<div class="indent"><em>My joy would be complete, dear, if you were only here <br/>But still, I keep your hand as a precious souvenir</em>
</div></li><li> The bleeding-purple "The Masochism Tango":
<div class="indent"><em>At your command <br/>Before you here, I stand <br/>My heart is in my hand—Ecch!</em>
</div></li></ul></li><li> Virginia O'Brien sang the dysfunctional torch song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLNql9aAjf0">"Say That We're Sweethearts Again"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, later covered by Dorothy Shay (the "Park Avenue Hillbillie") and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Harley Quinn</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic">"Weird Al" Yankovic</a> does at least one of these on every album, such as "I Was Only Kidding" and "I'm So Sick of You". He's parodied every sub-genre, too, from Prince's leers in "Wanna Be Ur Lover" (<em>I don't have a library card, but do you mind if I check you out?</em>) to break-up songs in "You Don't Love Me Anymore" (<em>I still remember the way that you laughed / when you threw me down the elevator shaft</em>), "One More Minute" (<em>I'd rather clean all the bathrooms in Grand Central Station with my tongue / Than spend one more minute with you</em>), and "Since You've Been Gone" (<em>I feel almost as bad as I did / when you were still here</em>). He also wrote a mild-affection-song, "Good Enough For Now."
<ul><li> Possibly the funniest one of these is "Do I Creep You Out?", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">stalker-related</a> parody of overblown love songs (and specifically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AmericanIdol">American Idol</a></em>-winner Taylor Hicks' song "Do I Make You Proud"):
<div class="indent"><em>I like to feel the warm spot on your chair <br/>Sometimes I drool <br/>And usually I stare <br/>My precious one <br/>I saved that gum <br/>That you threw in the garbage!</em>
</div></li><li> From the same album <em>Confessions Part 3</em> continues the theme of confessions by being way too honest with his significant other.
</li><li> "Melanie" was an earlier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> style love ballad that ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> him jumping out of the 16th story window above her apartment to get her attention. He may be dead but he still loves her</span>.
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cBcSok7K5Y">Pancreas<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", about...well...a guy who loves his pancreas.
</li></ul></li><li> The Arrogant Worms wrote the weird context "Log Into You," about a computer geek with pick-up lines like <em>I gotta open up your motherboard — put my Pentium inside</em>.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAxisOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAxisOfAwesome">The Axis Of Awesome</a>'s "How to Write a Love Song" is a parody of R&amp;B love ballads, right down to commenting on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWildRapperAppears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWildRapperAppears">random spoken word section</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruckDriversGearChange">key change</a> and the various elements in the music video.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> wrote a song called "This Ain't A Love Song" in their <em>Saints of Los Angeles</em> album
</li><li> The Capitol Steps did exactly the same joke as the Arrogant Worms in "Nerd Perfect Blues" and "Yuppie Love".
</li><li> Da Vinci's Notebook has the weird-context "Window-Washing Cowboy," which is by far the most tragic tale about doomed love you will ever hear if you only hear songs about window washers. They also wrote "Title Of The Song," the perfect generic love song for all occasions.
</li><li> There's a good reason <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StephenLynch">Stephen Lynch</a> rebuffs enthusiastic female applause when he announces he's going to sing a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4bdqF5gwVw">"song for the ladies..."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MitchBenn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MitchBenn">Mitch Benn</a> does a lot of these. In "Imagine You Were Mine" the singer is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a>, and the final verse reveals he's composing this in prison, having broken the restraining order. "Now He's Gone" is a parody of 1950s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageDeathSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenageDeathSongs">Teenage Death Songs</a> songs like "The Leader of the Pack", about a girl who kills her boyfriends before they can cheat on her. "These Ghoulish Things" is a gothic song with a man describing somebody as various horrible things in a complementary way, and then getting confused when she takes offense.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamKinison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SamKinison">Sam Kinison</a>'s infamous "You Fucking Whore" (preceded by his equally infamous "emotional tampon" rant) expresses how every guy has felt after a bad break-up, but wouldn't admit for fear of seeming like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>.
</li><li> Bill Bailey's love ballad, which "encompasses all aspects of love; betrayal, hatred and depression." It shifts from a traditional ballad to a vitrolic parody halfway through, (and the cute moment of watching a duck in the park comes back):
<div class="indent"> The duck lies shredded in a pancake / Soaking in the hoi sin of your lies...
</div></li><li> The works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PDQBach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PDQBach">P.D.Q. Bach</a> include a few such songs, such as "My Bonnie Lass She Smelleth", "The Queen To Me A Royal Pain Doth Give", and "Jane, My Jane" (<em>For your hair is your crown (which you remove when you retire) / and your breath is like down (wind of a compost heap on fire)...</em>)
</li><li> Also in the classical genre is Paul Sjolund's "Love Lost," settings of four great(?) anti-love poems.
<dl><dd><div class="indent"><em>When you're away <br/>I'm restless, lonely, wretched, bored, dejected. <br/>Only here's the rub, my darling dear: <br/>I feel the same when you are here.</em>
</div></dd></dl></li><li> On the album for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheColbertReport">A Colbert Christmas</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasSpecial">The Greatest Gift of All</a></em>, there's the song "A Cold, Cold Christmas". Colbert sings about a breakup wishing death upon the girl who broke up on him to extreme degrees. Sample lyrics:
<div class="indent"><em>You hung up my heart like a stocking/Then went and stuffed it with coal/Now I want a cold, cold Christmas/To gnaw at the depths of your soul</em>.
</div><ul><li> There's also Stephen and the Colberts' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">'80s hit</a> "Charlene (I'm Right Behind You)", which has the subtext of being a song about a girl Colbert is stalking.
</li></ul></li><li> Wilco's "Via Chicago" begins: "I dreamed about killing you again last night/ and it felt alright to me."
</li><li> Robby Roadsteamer's <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uTm7vDtoVY">"I Hope You Get Ugly In Heaven"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a power-ballad duet where Robby offers up some already skewed romantic sentiment ("I hope you get ugly in heaven/ 'cause you might love someone, someone like me"), which guest vocalist Heidi Lee bluntly rebuffs:
<div class="indent"> <em>I hope you don't call me in heaven <br/>'Cause you were <strong>creepy</strong> back on earth <br/>I hope they have counseling in heaven <br/>'Cause maybe that'd help you take it down a notch</em>
</div><ul><li> Even his complete non-sequitur reference to Pee-wee Herman is followed by her impassioned cry of "I love Pee-wee Herman/ but I doooooonnnn't love yooooooooouuuuu!"
</li></ul></li><li> Lily Tomlin and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarryManilow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarryManilow">Barry Manilow</a> released the appropriately titled "Last Duet" as seen by the introductory lines:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Lily</strong>: You <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">creep</a> <br/>Into my heart <br/>And make my heart burn <br/><strong>Barry</strong>: You sneak <br/>Into my mind <br/>And make my head ache <br/><strong>Both</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">There are things I long to tell you</a> <br/><strong>Lily</strong>: You're much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">too blond</a> <br/><strong>Barry</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchingSomeZs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchingSomeZs">You snore</a> <br/><strong>Both</strong>: Look <br/>It's time to face the music <br/><strong>Barry</strong>: Bye bye <br/><strong>Lily</strong>: Don't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSoundEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSoundEffects">slam the door</a> <br/>And I don't want <br/><strong>Barry</strong>: I don't want <br/><strong>Lily</strong>: I don't want <br/><strong>Barry</strong>: I don't want <br/><strong>Both</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingEachOthersSentences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingEachOthersSentences">No, I don't want your flowers anymore</a>!

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLonelyIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheLonelyIsland">The Lonely Island</a> also have "Dreamgirl", which starts out as a love song about an ugly, insane girl with bad fashion sense ("Yo, you're a vision in sweats with the neon pouch, half-eaten squirrel hanging out of your mouth"), and by the end suddenly becomes a love song about <em>Chex Mix</em>.
</li><li> "Dick In A Box" may also be an example.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMinchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TimMinchin">Tim Minchin</a> assures his love that if he didn't have her, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xu-eXl1XYQ">he'd probably have someone else<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Although this one is less "anti-love" (he's at pains to express that he does love his wife, to whom the song's addressed) as it is "anti-stupid ideas about love like that everyone has exactly one soulmate with whom they fall in love instantly and permanently instead of forging a powerful connection over time with shared experience".
</li><li> Minchin himself insists that the song is not about love at all, but about math. The lyrics are based on statistics, not cynicism.
<ul><li> Then of course there's his very genuine love song <em>to an inflatable sex doll</em>. And two-thirds of his other songs...
</li><li> "Nothing Can Stop Us Now" is particularly effective thanks to the refreshingly realistic final line.
</li></ul></li><li> "You Grew On Me" might seem like this, but gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a>, and you have to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEdBIbE_x2U">listen to it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to see how comparing love to a <em>tumor</em> can describe true love and not come over as an Anti-Love Song.
</li></ul></li><li> The German artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">Farin Urlaub</a> has a song titled "Phänomenal Egal", which narrates the singer's phenomenal indifference the singer feels towards his girlfriend.
<ul><li> Though if you read between the lines, it becomes clear that this is actually a true-blue love song in disguise. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says Farin wanted to write a straightforward love ballad but thought he couldn't make it sound cool enough, hence the denying lyrics.

</li><li> Amy Rigby's "Cynically Yours", pretty much what it sounds like: "At the end of the day / I've got nothing good to say / But you don't suck / So I'm cynically yours".
</li><li> A possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample">Ur-Example</a> of this type of song was written in 1913, "And The Green Grass Grew All Around", not to be confused with the similarly titled nursery rhyme "The Green Grass Grew All Around", although it's also somewhat a spoof of the latter, which was written just a year before. The song involves little Johnny Green and little Sally Brown, starting out all innocently enough like a cute little Edwardian era love song before we see hints of what's to come. Wealthy little Johnny promises to take care of Sally and share his wealth, seeing as how he already gave her a lot of gold. The second verse is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">Big-Lipped Alligator Moment</a> discussing Johnny and Sally buying a "Ford machine" and getting into a violent hit and run accident with a butcher cart. Instead of "green grass grew all around" it's "lamb chops/spare ribs flew all around", and the accident injured the poor butcher quite graphically possibly even killed him, apparently they heard his kidneys rupture, and his ribs were broken and his heart was physically damaged (although "broke his ribs and heart" could have been a heartbreak metaphor, although in the context it's unlikely). Third verse rejoins our lovebirds after marriage, and we find out that the meal they cook together isn't so tender of a moment when she poisoned his biscuits which kills him. The end is a sad version of the chorus with the last line an inappropriately happy version. So we have gold digging black widows, vehicular homicide, and graphic deaths described in great detail.<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Yeah, that's really a clean, wholesome innocent song about the 1910s.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Just a couple of years before</a> "And The Green Grass Grew All Around", H. H. Munro imagined <a class="urllink" href="http://www.classicreader.com/book/1896/1/">a song writer who was so bored with writing endless glurge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that he penned the following:
<div class="indent">How you bore me, Florrie,
</div><div class="indent">With those eyes of vacant blue;
</div><div class="indent">You'll be very sorry, Florrie,
</div><div class="indent">If I marry you.

</li><li> "U Stink But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardiovascularLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardiovascularLove">I ❤ U</a>" by Mucky Pup, which was originally credited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BloomCounty">Billy And The Boingers</a>, appearing on a flexidisk record along with "We're The Boingers" in <em>Billy And The Boingers: Bootleg</em>. The song is basically about how repulsive the singer's girlfriend really is ("I hate your polyester pantsuits, and your greasy hair, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryTeeth">the stuff between your braces</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairyGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairyGirl">your hairy derriere</a>"), but he still loves her regardless.
</li><li> John Forster's "Way Down Deep (You're Shallow)" deserves a mention, as it's ostensibly a love song between two utterly-superficial people who claim to love one another <em>because</em> there's nothing in the other to love.
</li><li> Australian comedian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatMcSnatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KatMcSnatch">Kat McSnatch</a>'s "Love" is a song of hatred towards love itself. She even wonders "why everybody wants it".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BoBurnham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BoBurnham">Bo Burnham</a>'s "Repeat Stuff", which is all about taking the piss out of vapid commercialized "appeal to as general an audience as possible" pop love songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigBadBosses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BigBadBosses">Big Bad Bosses</a> has two examples:
<ul><li> "Angel" starts out as a typical love song with Sephiroth picking up a woman at a club, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but everything is sent completely off the rails when he summons Meteor to destroy the planet.</span>
</li><li> "Capture You" seems normal at first but near the end, it's revealed that the song's about Ganon <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">wanting to have sex with Link</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrazyExGirlfriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CrazyExGirlfriend">Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</a></em> <em>loves</em> this trope:
<ul><li> The song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmbLB4OIuao">"Settle for Me"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is all about how Greg knows that he's not what Rebecca <em>really</em> wants, but that she should settle for him anyway. "I know I'm only second place in this game. / But like 2% milk / Or Seitan beef / I almost taste the same!"
</li><li> "A Boy Band Made Up Of Four Joshes" is, obviously, a parody of squeaky-clean boy band love songs, but also lampshades how Rebecca expects Josh to fix all of her mental health issues by making the boy band members "also a team of nationally-recognised mental health professionals trained in cognitive-behavioural therapy with specialties in personality and sleep disorders... and <em>love!</em>"
</li><li> "His Status Is... Preferred" is a minor example in that the feeling is sincere, but all of the supposedly impressive things Paula croons about - like drinking whiskey, or staying at hotels where they do multiple kinds of omelettes - are really <em>not.</em>
</li><li> "Romantic Moments" is...well, just see the lyrics: "Romantic moments you had that he didn't know were romantic / Or maybe he did a little, we're not really sure? / But most likely not."
</li><li> "Clean Up on Aisle 4" is a more traditional example, being a love song that's just tortured into fitting the unusual theme of a supermarket.
</li><li> "Oh My God I Think I Like You" involves an unwanted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveEpiphany">Love Epiphany</a> occurring well into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendsWithBenefits">Friends with Benefits</a> situation where the singer is totally blase about all the kinky sex they're having but freaks out at the idea of catching feelings.
</li><li> "I'm Just A Girl In Love" parodies the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy">Love Makes You Crazy</a> trope with a chorus line of girls insisting that because Rebecca's in love, she can't be held responsible for her actions.
</li><li> "Love Kernels" is about Rebecca's status as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMartyr">Love Martyr</a> and how she grabs onto every slight indication of affection as proof of a deeper love, even statements as unrelated as "Where's my phone?" ("It's a stretch, but I'll take that, too.")
</li><li> "Ping Pong Girl" parodies 00s era pop punk songs romanticising the independent, aloof girl - "She's so hot but she doesn't know it / She probably just found that outfit lying around (Like in the trash!)"
</li><li> "Research Me Obsessively" is a seduction song sung by the characters' ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend, huskily crooning at them to lose days tracking her down online and learn everything about her.
</li><li> "Duh!" parodies the whole 'I'm an idiot for never noticing her' trope by leaning on how Josh is just kind of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Brainless Beauty</a> in general - "Wait, I gotta go get her! I gotta get her, like, right this second! <em>*cut to Josh running down the street*</em> I'm coming for you baby! ...wait, I don't have my keys. I left my keys and phone at the club? ...<em>duh.</em>'"
</li><li> "We'll Never Have Problems Again" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HakunaMatata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HakunaMatata">Hakuna Matata</a> type parody all about how clearly delusional <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Josh and Rebecca</span> are to think that being in love will solve all of their problems for them.
</li><li> "Let's Have Intercourse" sounds exactly like a soulful <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdSheeran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EdSheeran">Ed Sheeran</a></em> number, but is actually Nathaniel singing about how he looks down on Rebecca and really doesn't want to be attracted to her, but since he is, they might as well have sex and get it over with.
</li><li> "Maybe She's Not Such A Heinous Bitch After All" sounds like a perky, happy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalLoveSong">Parental Love Song</a> but is all about how relieved Rebecca is that her mother is actually acting kind of decent for once, and how relieved she is to be able to hate her "like normal girls hate their moms."
</li><li> "First Penis I Saw" is a genuinely happy, excitable song all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheirFirstTime">Their First Time</a> - just one that happens to focus rather more than usual on the specific milestone of seeing and touching a penis for the first time.
</li><li> "Nothing Is Ever Anyone's Fault" is a moving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalLoveDuet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalLoveDuet">Final Love Duet</a> in which the singers opine that they fell in love when the other made them realise that since they had a sad childhood, they don't have any responsibility for their actions and nobody is ever really a bad person.
</li></ul></li><li> "My Baby Only Cares About Me" performed by Caroline Quinlan on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JohnFinnemoresSouvenirProgramme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/JohnFinnemoresSouvenirProgramme">John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme</a></em> is a pastiche of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinaSimone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NinaSimone">Nina Simone</a>'s "My Baby Just Cares For Me", which takes the premise <em>utterly literally</em> and concludes that a boyfriend with <em>no interests whatsoever</em> is boring and shallow.
<div class="indent">My baby don't read, or go to the flicks, <br/>My baby is as thick as a brick. <br/>I said, my baby, <br/>Is a bit, <br/>Of a prick.
</div></li><li> Cantata Pansophical made a series of songs parodying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em>, following one of the story arcs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CriticalRole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/CriticalRole">Critical Role</a></em>. Their version of "Helpless", which was originally a love song, gets turned into a scene of a city being sacked by four ancient dragons, and the adventuring party Vox Machina are too powerless to do anything but run away and vow revenge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlightOfTheConchords">Flight of the Conchords</a></em>: "The Most Beautiful Girl (In The Room)", in which the singer spends the song delivering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnedByFaintPraise">backhanded compliments</a> to a woman he's only mildly interested in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmandaPalmer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AmandaPalmer">Amanda Palmer</a>'s "The Vegemite", which starts out as a for love song that becomes increasingly farcical as her partner's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorFlawMajorBreakup">love of Vegemite becomes a wedge that drives them apart</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LesLuthiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LesLuthiers">Les Luthiers</a> has "Siento algo por tí" (I feel something for you), a song from the fictional composer Huesito Williams.
<div class="indent">Ever since I saw you I feel something for you <br/>that I'm feeling for the first time; <br/>ever since I saw you I feel something for you <br/>something I've never imagined, <br/>and I want you to know [what it is]: <br/>I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

<ul><li> Many of Waits' songs from his early years skit the edge between this trope and tender or touching love songs. His songs are often sad or gritty, depicting couples in rough points in their relationships, sadness after a relationship has ended, or lamenting what could have been.

</li><li> The Rondo Brothers' "Still Your Ghost" features a sultry female vocalist and an up-tempo beat.

<ul><li> Rodgers and Hart wrote a few other Anti Love Songs, one being the duet "Ev'rything I Got" from <em>By Jupiter</em>, which has lines like "I'm not yours for better but for worse." (The reprise is a more standard sort of love song, though a highly martyred one.)

<div class="indent">You'll be back, soon you'll see <br/>You'll remember you belong to me <br/>You'll be back, time will tell <br/>You'll remember that I served you well <br/>Oceans rise, empires fall, we have seen each other through it all <br/>And when push comes to shove <br/>I will send a fully-armed battalion to remind you of my love!

Therefore, a woman should ask for tangible, appreciating assets (like diamonds) from her male admirers so that she can sell them to make the rent when she is too old to be considered attractive.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NSYNC">*NSYNC</a>'s "Bye Bye Bye" is a rare example of an anti-love song sung by a boy band:
<div class="indent"> Don't wanna be a fool for you
</div><div class="indent"> Just another player in your game for two
</div><div class="indent"> You may hate me but it ain't no lie,
</div><div class="indent"> Baby, bye, bye, bye

</div><div class="indent"> It might sound crazy, but it ain't no lie
</div><div class="indent"> Baby, bye, bye, bye
</div><ul><li> "Bye Bye Bye" was the first single from the band's first album after an acrimonious breakup with their previous manager and record label. Whether there is a real-life subtext to the song is debatable, but if there is the video makes it <em>really</em> obvious, with a woman playing with the boys as marionettes.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PetShopBoys">Pet Shop Boys</a>' "I'm With Stupid"—on the surface, a fun little pop song about being in love with someone perceived as a dim bulb. The hidden meaning (cheerfully admitted by the Boys)? A satire of the relationship between Tony Blair and George Bush, sung from Blair's point of view. Contains the gem "Is stupid really stupid, or a different kind of smart?"
<ul><li> Their cover of "Always on My Mind" has the line "maybe I didn't love you" in the fade-out, which is a lot less subtle in the album version.

"Erase" sounds like a regretful breakup song until you realize he's actually taunting his former lover and suggesting they kill themselves in order to get over him:
<div class="indent"><em>When the pain won't go away</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>You might as well put your finger on the trigger</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Erase my love</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>I bet you can't erase my touch</em>
</div></li><li> Ludo's "Good Will Hunting By Myself" starts as a standard whiny breakup song and quickly devolves into a spiteful rant about how awful the ex-girlfriend in question actually was. The spoken-word climax must be heard to be believed, but the final chorus is pretty great as well:
<div class="indent"><em>You can watch Good Will Hunting by yourself (you bitch, please die)</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>You can waste your life without my help (you bitch, please die)</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>You can hang out with your friends, that is if you <strong>have</strong> any friends</em>

</div><div class="indent"><em>Why dont you go watch it by yourself?</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Go to hell!</em>
</div></li><li> Arguably, everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FallOutBoy">Fall Out Boy</a> have ever written, or at least about 90% of it.
<ul><li> An example from "Get Busy Living Or Get Busy Dying":
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>I used to obsess over living</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Now I only obsess over you</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Tell me you'd like boys like me better</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>In the dark lying on top of you</em>
</div><ul><li> Another from The Music or the Misery:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>I got your love letters, corrected the grammar, and sent them back</em> <br/><em>It's true, romance is dead</em> <br/><em>I shot it in the chest then in the head</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BelleAndSebastian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BelleAndSebastian">Belle and Sebastian</a>'s "You Don't Send Me" is upbeat and peppy, but is all about how happy the singer is that his girlfriend broke up with him:
<div class="indent"><em>Since you went away, everything is looking great</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>I'm a little bored</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>When I see you out, maybe walking in the street</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>You always cross the road</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>Listen, honey, there is nothing you can do to offend me any more</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>You don't send me any more...</em>
</div><ul><li> So despite the suggestion that "<em>the key is change, getting over all your problems</em>", we're left thinking that he's maybe protesting a <em>little</em> too much.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ReelBigFish">Reel Big Fish</a> writes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterRevolt">when they're not mad at their label.</a>
<ul><li> Perhaps the best example is "Your Guts (I Hate 'Em)"; The opening lines say it all:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>I wrote this song about you</em> <br/><em>I wrote this song about you</em> <br/><em>just to let you know... that I hate your guts</em> <br/><em>and I think... you suck.</em>
</div><ul><li> They also have "Suckers" Which at worst is mildly amused that there are still "Suckers who still believe in love. This one's for you!"
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HelloProject">Hello! Project</a> songs.

</div><ul><li> Except that as the song goes on, it becomes apparent that it's not even a breakup song at all; "Darcy" is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of a <em>pub</em>.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMagneticFields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMagneticFields">The Magnetic Fields</a>. Examples include "I Don't Really Love You Any More" (self-explanatory) and "I Don't Believe You", which contains the lyric "You seemed to be / In love with me / Which isn't very realistic."
<ul><li> Much, if not all, of their three-album set <em>69 Love Songs</em> falls under this trope.
<ul><li> In fact, it includes all four of the sub-categories listed in the trope description, and probably makes up a few more.
</li></ul></li><li> "I Don't Believe You" strikes me more of a song about someone with such low self-esteem that they can't believe the person actually loves them. It's what I get from quotes like
</li></ul><div class="indent"> You say you quote unquote love me
</div><div class="indent"> Well, stranger things have come to be
</div><div class="indent"> But let's agree to disagree
</div><div class="indent"> Cause I don't believe you
</div><div class="indent"> [...]
</div><div class="indent"> You tell me of what once was
</div><div class="indent"> And all about Buck, Butch, and Buzz...
</div><div class="indent"> And how I'm not like them because...
</div><div class="indent"> But I don't believe you
</div><div class="indent"> [...]
</div><div class="indent"> So you may set your charm on stun
</div><div class="indent"> Say I'm delightful and fun
</div><div class="indent"> But you say that to everyone
</div><div class="indent"> So I don't believe you
<ul><li> And don't forget 'I Can't Touch You Anymore', with lines like
</li></ul></div><div class="indent"> I can't touch you anymore
</div><div class="indent"> There's so much to hate you for
</div><div class="indent"> You're asking the wrong questions
</div><div class="indent"> You're opening wrong doors
</div><div class="indent"> I love you, but I can't touch you anymore
</div><ul><li> Also, "You Must Be Out Of Your Mind" - A hate song about an ex including the lines:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> I want you crawling back to me
</div><div class="indent"> Down on your knees, yeah
</div><div class="indent"> Like an appendectomy
</div><div class="indent"> Sans anaesthesia
</div><ul><li> "100,000 Fireflies" is, for the most part, an earnest (if bleak) love song, but then you get to the coda:
</li></ul><div class="indent">You won't be happy with me
</div><div class="indent">But give me one more chance
</div><div class="indent">You won't be happy anyway
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lit">Lit</a> - "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Miserable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Miserable">Miserable</a>" has a series of lyrics which suggest this.
<div class="indent"> You make me come.
</div><div class="indent"> You make me complete.
</div><div class="indent"> You make me completely miserable.
</div></li><li> And of course, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodCharlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GoodCharlotte">Good Charlotte</a>'s "<strike>I Don't Want to Be in Love</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefrainFromAssuming">Dance Floor Anthem</a>".
</li><li> Feargal Sharkey of The Undertones has a good one: "You Little Thief". With lyrics like, "How does it feel to make a grown man wanna die", it definitely qualifies.
</li><li> "Gunning Down Romance" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SavageGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SavageGarden">Savage Garden</a>.
</li><li> "Even Hitler Had a Girlfriend" by The Mr. T Experience.
</li><li> Before writing the many romantic hit songs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ABBA">ABBA</a>, Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus wrote "Det Dar Med Karlek" ("That Thing With Romance"), mocking the amount of love songs dominating the top ten list. (A bad translation of the chorus follows.)
<div class="indent">That thing with romance
</div><div class="indent">Who invented it?
</div><div class="indent">We're never left in peace
</div><div class="indent">It's advertised everywhere
</div><div class="indent">That thing with romance
</div><div class="indent">What's so great about it?
</div><div class="indent">How can we all stand it anymore?
</div><div class="indent">Most of it's just a big pile of crap!
</div></li><li> "Goodbye Good Guy" by Frente starts off sounding like the typical pining-for-a-lost-lover-please-take-me-back number, but by the end of the song the singer has realised they've been tricked all along.
<div class="indent">Something was hovering over you boy, just then
</div><div class="indent">you scolded me, told me don't bother, and vanished again
</div><div class="indent">and everything perfect you said was just mirrors and wires
</div><div class="indent">you look left, I was right

</div></li><li> "Possession" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahMcLachlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SarahMcLachlan">Sarah McLachlan</a>. An intense, highly erotic song... based on mash notes from an insane stalker fan. (Who tried to sue her for plagiarism, then killed himself when he lost the case.)

</div><div class="indent">I can't be happy while you're still alive

</div></li><li> "Don't Bother" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Shakira">Shakira</a>. The video has her destroying her boyfriend's Ford Mustang.
</li><li> Many Only Ones songs fall under this, particularly "No Solution": "Some girls say they're loving ya/but love is just destruction disguised under another name...you stand for everything I despise, but when you hold me and look in my eyes I know I can't let you go..."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FionaApple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FionaApple">Fiona Apple</a>'s "Get Him Back" is pretty much a hate song in its first two verses, then ricochets into an upbeat love song in verse #3.
</li><li> "Polly" by Captain Dangerous is an Anti Love Song in which the singer gleefully describes how utterly unenamoured he is with the titular young lady. It features the classic line "By the way: I'm gonna kill you", as well as the chorus:
<div class="indent"><em>I've got condiments in my kitchen <br/>That kill people like you in the evening <br/>You look like something I've never seen before, see <br/>I've got three words, and they're "fuck you, Polly".</em>
</div><ul><li> We can't mention Captain Dangerous in this section without mentioning "Boozehounds" either.
</li></ul></li><li> 20 Fingers' "Short Dick Man" (also known as "Short Short Man" due to censorship) is a song about a woman turning down a man with micropenis.
<div class="indent"> Isn't that cute an extra belly button <br/>You need to put your pants back on honey
</div></li><li> "Where Is The Love" by Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway - a song about a couple having an affair with each other, each demanding to know when they were going to have the other to themselves, and both refusing to answer.
</li><li> How Kirk Thatcher's "I Hate You" <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX8kKEh8DGU">took so long to be mentioned<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDivineComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheDivineComedy">The Divine Comedy</a> had one called 'Frog Princess', in which the singer recounts on a girl from his past who didn't actually believe in love, and drifted from partner to partner. His true feelings for her shine the most in these lines:
<div class="indent"><em>And now I'm rid of her, I must confess <br/>To thinkin' 'bout what might have been... <br/>And I can visualise my frog princess <br/>Beneath a shining... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> guillotine.</span></em>
</div></li><li> "It's Yer Money I'm After Baby" by The Wonder Stuff includes the adorable "Don't worry 'bout your heart/it's your bank I want to break"
</li><li> "Wind It Up" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarenakedLadies">Barenaked Ladies</a>:

<ul><li> Prince also had "I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man", where he is upfront and honest with a woman who just got out of a long-term relationship and is showing serious romantic interest in him about how he's only down for a hookup or friends with benefits, and isn't going to pretend otherwise because it wouldn't be fair to her.

The two most famous examples are <em>Is She Really Going Out With Him?</em> and <em>It's Different For Girls</em>. But the <em>Look Sharp</em> album is one where you could play <em>any</em> track and it will be an anti love song. <em>Happy Loving Couples</em> is quite possibly the most misanthropic and embittered of the lot.
<div class="indent">Happy Loving Couples make it look so easy,

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MotleyCrue">Mötley Crüe</a> wrote "You're All I Need" in <em>Girls, Girls, Girls</em>, which sounds like a typical love ballad, but in reality is about obsessively killing a woman and ending in jail.
<ul><li> They also wrote "Too Young to Fall in Love" which describes a bitter relationship (This song would be mentioned in their song "Don't Go Away Mad")
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> For all of their straight-up love songs, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Queen">Queen</a> wrote a surprising number of these, ranging from "I'm in Love with My Car" to "You Don't Fool Me".
<div class="indent"> "Told my girl I'd forget her <br/> Rather buy me a new carburetor"
</div></li><li> "Heavy In Your Arms" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlorenceAndTheMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlorenceAndTheMachine">Florence + the Machine</a> is a pretty vicious Anti-Love Song about how the narrator is a dead weight around her lover's neck, always dragging him down until he decides to just let her drown in a river. It contains this lyric:
<div class="indent">This will be my last confession: "I love you" never felt like any blessing
</div><div class="indent">Whispering like it's a secret only to condemn the one who hears it

</li></ul></li><li> "Up The Hill Backwards" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a>, immediately after leaving Angela.
<ul><li> Years earlier (in his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame">Old Shame</a> days before <em>Space Oddity</em>) he had <a class="urllink" href="http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Albums/DB/LYTT.html">"Love You Till Tuesday"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a deliriously cheerful pop number in which a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Stalker with a Crush</a> speaker implores a girl to return his endless love, and by "endless" he means "it will last for <em>two days</em>".

<ul><li> "I swore that I would love you to the end of time! [...] So now I'm praying for the end of time!"
</li><li> Also from Meat Loaf/Steinman, "I'll Kill You If You Don't Come Back":

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a>'s first album, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreakOut">Freak Out</a></em>, is almost fifty percent Anti Love Songs, with each one parodying a different sub-genre of doo-wop. "I Ain't Got No Heart," or "Go Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder," anyone?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> actually made fun of this, possibly to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion,</a> in "Silly Love Songs":
<div class="indent">You'd think that people would have had enough of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">Silly Love Songs</a>
</div><div class="indent">But I look around me/And I see it isn't so
</div><div class="indent">Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs
</div><div class="indent">And what's wrong with that?
</div><div class="indent">I'd like to know, 'cause here/I go/Again!
</div></li><li> "Every Day I Love You Less and Less" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KaiserChiefs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KaiserChiefs">Kaiser Chiefs</a>. The title is pretty self-explanatory, really.
</li><li> Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeachBoys">The Beach Boys</a> did this. "Here Today" starts off <em>sounding</em> like a conventional love song, but the lyrics take a turn for the worse <em>real</em> fast, with lines like:
<ul><li> <em>"A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing / But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring..."</em>
</li><li> And more relevantly: <em>"Right now you think that she's perfection / This time is really an exception / You know I hate to be a downer / But I'm the guy she <strong>left</strong> before you found her..."</em>
</li><li> Well, it was from <em>Pet Sounds</em>, the album where their subject matter got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pulp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pulp">Pulp</a> seem to have at least one of these on each of their albums.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tencc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tencc">10cc</a>'s "I'm Not in Love" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">messes with the listener's head</a> - on the surface it sounds like an anti love song, but on another level it sounds as if the narrator is unsuccessfully trying to convince himself that he isn't in love. The entire lyric is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">Suspiciously Specific Denial</a>, which according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> was done deliberately.
<ul><li> About half of the band's output was "weird love"/stalker songs, very often featuring extremely odd symbolism
</li></ul></li><li> One up-and-coming genius in this field is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton">Jonathan Coulton</a>. For example, from his evil-genius-in-love song <em><a class="urllink" href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/songdetails/Skullcrusher%20Mountain">Skullcrusher Mountain<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>:
<div class="indent"><em>I made this half-pony half-monkey monster to please you</em> <br/><em>But I get the feeling that you don't like it</em> <br/><em>What's with all the screaming?</em> <br/><em>You like monkeys, you like ponies</em> <br/><em>Maybe you don't like monsters so much</em> <br/><em>Maybe I used too many monkeys</em> <br/><em>Isn't it enough to know that I ruined a pony making a gift for you?</em>
</div><ul><li> There's also "A Laptop Like You," which is a country ballad-style love song sung to...a MacBook Pro.
</li><li> And "Someone is Crazy":
</li></ul><div class="indent"><em>The world's against you so you think or maybe wish it was</em> <br/><em>And at least that way someone would care but baby no one does</em> <br/><em>Not even you</em> <br/><em>Baby someone is crazy and it's you.</em>
</div></li><li> The Beautiful South song "Song For Whoever" sure <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">sounds</a></em> like a love song, but it's actually a parody; the song is about a songwriter gleefully describing how he uses his relationships with women — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">good</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorBreakdown">bad</a> — as inspiration, and how this brings him loads and loads of cash and critical acclaim.
<ul><li> This hits its peak where it becomes clear that he loves making his girlfriends cry, because that always leads to great materials for songs. ("Deep, so deep, the number one I hope to reap/Depends upon the tears you weep, so cry, lover, cry...")
</li><li> They've done a fair few. "I'll Sail This Ship Alone" is essentially about a man accepting his ex-partner's decision to leave him, while still trying to win her back. However, the song ends with the line "<em>Well they said if I burned myself alive/That you'd come running back.</em>" Another is "We Are Each Other", which sounds, on the surface, like a song about an intensely close lyrics, until it becomes clear that the relationship was suffocating for them and is now over.
</li><li> Their most straightforward anti love song is probably "Something That You Said":
<div class="indent"> The perfect love song it has no words; it only has death threats.
</div><div class="indent"> And you can tell a classic ballad by how threatening it gets.
</div></li></ul></li><li> A part of the reason why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM">R.E.M.</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Document" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Document">"The One I Love"</a> became the band's first hit was because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisaimedFandom">many people</a> saw it as a love song: "this one goes out to the one I love". Their ears didn't pick that not only the particular loved one has been left behind, but the narrator also calls her "a simple/another prop to occupy my time".
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderBallad">Used To Love Her</a>" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Guns N' Roses</a> is a fairly blatant and obvious example. Sure is fun to sing after a breakup, though.
<ul><li> It's a subversion: it's actually about <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Axl's Dog</span>.
</li><li> "Locomotive", <strong>and how!</strong>
</li><li> Also "Back Off Bitch".
</li><li> "My Michelle" is this because Axl thought a straight-up ballad was not an homage that fit the titular Michelle (in fact, she loved the song because it was honest!).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePogues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ThePogues">The Pogues</a>', "Fairytale of New York" (also an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiChristmasSong">Anti-Christmas Song</a>, of course):
<div class="indent"><em>You're a bum</em> <br/><em>You're a punk</em> <br/><em>You're an old slut on junk</em> <br/><em>Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed</em> <br/><em>You scumbag, you maggot</em> <br/><em>You cheap lousy faggot</em> <br/><em>Happy Christmas your arse</em> <br/><em>I pray God it's our last</em>
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraBareilles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SaraBareilles">Sara Bareilles</a> has become famous for songs of this nature. Her portfolio includes "Bottle It Up", about the downside of love and obsession; "Gravity", about destructive love; and the ironically titled "Love Song", which was heavily influenced by her label trying to force her into writing a peppy love song in order to become more successful. Ironically, it is her biggest-selling single to date.
<div class="indent">I'm not gonna write you a love song <br/>Cause you've asked for it <br/>Cause you need one <br/>Yeah, you see...I'm not gonna write you a love song <br/>Cause you tell me it's make or break in this <br/>If you're on your way...I'm not gonna write you to stay <br/>If all you have is leaving, I'm gonna need a better reason <br/>To write you a love song today
</div><ul><li> Also "Fairytale", about fairytale love and how it doesn't work.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSistersOfMercy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheSistersOfMercy">The Sisters of Mercy</a> did this one in "I Was Wrong:"
<div class="indent">I was wrong
</div><div class="indent">I was wrong to ever doubt
</div><div class="indent">I can get along without
</div><div class="indent">I can love my fellow man,
</div><div class="indent">But I'm damned if I'll love yours
</div><ul><li> And "Ribbons", too, depending on how you interpret it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Cardigans "Lovefool" (of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WilliamShakespearesRomeoAndJuliet">Romeo + Juliet</a></em> fame) is mistaken for a love song because of the upbeat tempo but the song is actually a woman begging her boyfriend to just pretend that he loves her even if he doesn't because she can't stand to be alone. There is the line
<div class="indent"> I don't care if you really care as long as you don't go
</div><ul><li> And of course, the chorus:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> So I cry and I pray and I beg
</div><div class="indent"> Love Me, love me
</div><div class="indent"> Say that you love me
</div><div class="indent"> Fool Me fool me
</div><div class="indent"> Go on and fool me
</div><div class="indent"> Love Me love me
</div><div class="indent"> Pretend that you love me
</div><div class="indent"> Leave me leave me
</div><div class="indent"> Just say that you need me
</div><ul><li> Most of their songs actually tend to come under this heading, if you look at the lyrics more closely. And even the ones that look like straightforward lovesongs lyrically tend to be undermined by Nina Persson's delivery, e.g. the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">snarky</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyMonotone">monotone</a> in which she sings "And now I've found a partner, no one could be happier than I am" (it doesn't help that the song is called "Happy Meal", which suggests less the anticipation of a romantic dinner the lyrics overtly deal in than cheap fast food)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Maroon5">Maroon 5</a> songs fall victims to this sometimes. "If I Never See Your Face Again" is about an unhealthy relationship about two that kind of hate each other but have sexual chemistry that keeps them coming back to each other.
<ul><li> <em>Songs About Jane</em> and <em>Hands All Over</em> have heaps of these types of songs.
</li><li> "Payphone" is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong">Break-Up Song</a>, but it also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">Silly Love Songs</a> bashing. Radio version lyrics:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> If happy ever after did exist <br/>I would still be holding you like this <br/>All those fairytales are full of it <br/>One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LinkinPark">Linkin Park</a>'s second album <em>Meteora</em> has as a common lyrical theme which links psychological damage to staying in an unhealthy relationship.
<ul><li> Played more straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MinutesToMidnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MinutesToMidnight">Minutes to Midnight</a></em> with the song "In Pieces", which could be a description of Chester Bennington's divorce. It's essentially the speaker telling his partner to do her worst, because he will endure and not "be the one" to abandon his vows before she does.
</li><li> Also "Valentine's Day", about a person <em>literally dying</em> because they can't get a date.
</li></ul></li><li> "Where Were You When I Needed You", by the Grassroots (also done by the Bangles).
</li><li> Richard Thompson's "Shane and Dixie" seems to be fairly sweet love song about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple">Bonnie and Clyde-type bank robbing couple</a>- until the guy in the couple decides to perpetrate a murder-suicide with the girl so he can get his name in the paper. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He dies and is quickly forgotten, she lives and marries the reporter who comes to cover the incident.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>'s "Fool in the Rain": the "fool" is stood up and stands in the rain wondering where he went wrong...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">other than waiting on the wrong block</span>.
<ul><li> Another anti love song by Led Zeppelin is "Your Time Is Gonna Come", in which the singer tells his lying and cheating ex-girlfriend that one day she's going to reap what she sows.
</li><li> "Bron-Y-Aur Stomp" is a genuinely sweet song about Robert Plant's love and friendship... for his dog.
</li></ul></li><li> We've gotten a long way down this list without Ludo's "Love Me Dead":
<div class="indent">You suck so passionately <br/>You're a parasitic psycho, filthy creature <br/>Finger-bangin' my heart <br/>You call me up drunk <br/>Does the fun ever start?
</div><ul><li> Their "The Horror of Our Love" fits a different part of this trope, being a completely serious love song... from a murderous stalker to a girl he kills midway through the song.
</li></ul></li><li> The Turtles' "Eleonore" is an example of the overdone sort of parody, complete with a line in the chorus lampshading how cliched everything is ("You're my pride and joy, et cetera"), though it's often mistaken for a straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SillyLoveSongs">silly love song</a>. The band felt they were being forced to churn out simple pop songs by their record company when they wanted to go in a more progressive direction, and intentionally wrote the lyrics to be as cliched, cheesy, and behind the times as possible, hoping the result would point out how out-of-fashion this kind of song was. Of course, this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringtimeForHitler">backfired spectacularly</a>: The record company loved it, and it became one of their biggest hit singles.
</li><li> Also, Good Charlotte's song "Bloody Valentine" is about a man who kills a girl's boyfriend to show that he loves her. It has to be heard to be believed.
<ul><li> The beginning of the song:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> Oh my love
</div><div class="indent"> please don't cry
</div><div class="indent"> I'll wash my bloody hands and we'll start a new life.
</div><div class="indent"> I ripped out, his throat
</div><div class="indent"> And called you on the telephone to
</div><div class="indent"> take off my disguise
</div><div class="indent"> Just in time to hear you cry...
</div></li><li> The Mountain Goats' "No Children:"
<div class="indent">I hope I lie <br/>And tell everyone you were a good wife <br/>I hope you die <br/>I hope we both die
</div><ul><li> Used to great effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em> to highlight the hate-filled and miserable relationship between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">Stepford Smiler</a> Bloberta and Clay Puppington.
</li><li> Actually, just about every song by The Mountain Goats qualifies.
</li></ul></li><li> The Smiths' bitter song "Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before" features this memorable lyric:
<div class="indent">Nothing's changed,
</div><div class="indent">I still love you, oh, I still love you
</div><div class="indent">Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> had "The Kids Are Alright," which is a fairly catchy, upbeat song about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">a man leaving his girlfriend</a>. In a similar vein (and on the same album) there's "A Legal Matter", about a man who's been forced into marriage now that his girlfriend is knocked up.
</li><li> "Anthrax" by Gang of Four features two vocal tracks. One is a typical set of anti love lyrics. The other is (largely) this monologue:
<div class="indent">Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about, most groups make most of their songs about falling in love or how happy they are to be in love, you occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time - it's because these groups think there's something very special about it either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has, you know to burst into song you have to be inspired and nothing inspires quite like love. These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone by singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love or so they would have you believe anyway but these groups seem to go along with the belief that love is deep in everyone's personality and I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love, we just don't think that what goes on between two people should be shrouded with mystery.
</div><ul><li> And it doesn't get much better in "Damaged Goods" or "We Live as We Dream, Alone", though at least the latter is marginally less caustic.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Rammstein">Rammstein</a> revels in songs like these. Most of their lyrics have hidden meanings and most of those tend to be cynical or sadistic in the extreme.
<ul><li> <em>Du Hast</em>, literally, is about a woman asking a man to marry her, with the man refusing to reply. However, the chorus is a pun - "Du hast, du hasst mich, du hast mich gefragt" should be translated "you have, <strong>you hate me</strong>, you've asked me".
</li><li> <em>Stein um Stein</em> is about possessive love of the worst kind. It seems sweet enough at times, with lyrics like "I will build us a home with a garden outside" and "I will always be with you" - but then the details of the house are described... "No windows, no door, inside will be darkness", "with your feet in the concrete, you will beautify the foundations" - "Stone by stone I wall you in, and no one will hear you scream."
</li><li> <em>Amour Amour</em> is an outright damnation of love itself, likening the feeling to a predator who cannot be tamed. At the end of the song the singer begs for a way out:
<div class="indent"> Please, please. <strong>Give me poison!</strong>
</div></li><li> <em>Amerika</em>, a cynical song about American commercialization around the world set to an upbeat melody, with a platonic example in the bridge:
<div class="indent"> This is not a love song!
</div><div class="indent"> This is not a love song!
</div><div class="indent"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LossOfIdentity">I don't speak my mother tongue!</a>
</div></li></ul></li><li> "All Sparks" by the Editors:
<div class="indent">Be careful angel, this life is just too long, all sparks will burn out in the end...
</div></li><li> "Die, Die My Darling" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheMisfits">The Misfits</a>.
<div class="indent">Die die die my darling
</div><div class="indent">Don't utter a single word
</div><div class="indent">Die die die my darling
</div><div class="indent">Just shut your pretty eyes
</div><div class="indent">I'll be seeing you again
</div><div class="indent">Yeah I'll be seeing you in hell...
</div><ul><li> Many of their songs are pretty anti-love (like "Angelfuck") and pro...erm...old horror movies, really.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndrewJacksonJihad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AndrewJacksonJihad">Andrew Jackson Jihad</a> has a lot of songs like this, most notably "I Love You" off of the album <em>Candy Cigarettes and Capguns</em>, which contains lyrics such as "I love you like the moon and stars, when little kids get hit by cars, girl you know its true," and "but I'll take anything, and I'll take anyone. I'll take an angry lesbian with a loaded gun. I'll take a whore with syphilis and gonorrhea too. But darling, I love you."
</li><li> Most Arab Strap songs.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JonathanCoulton">Jonathan Coulton</a> is known for this enough that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulAndStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulAndStorm">Paul and Storm</a> imitated him for a competition (and doing so very well) by writing a song ("Live") about a mad scientist trying to create the perfect girl by making a female <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>'s monster.
<ul><li> <em>Will she be friendly? / Or will she break free? / Will she terrorize the villagers? / — Will she notice me?</em>
</li><li> Paul and Storm also wrote a song called "Your Love Is (Love Song With Metaphor)" featuring a really demented view of unrequited love.
<ul><li> <em>Your love is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherWalken">Christopher Walken</a>...</em>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "My Future Ex Girl Friend" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Voltaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Voltaire">Voltaire</a>.
<ul><li> Voltaire also has "Stuck With You," about a married couple complaining about how their vows force them to stay together despite the fact they can't stand each other. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though after they die, they decide they prefer moldering in the ground together to alone.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> As a non-American example: the Ukrainian band Skryabin made several of those. Among the most memorable ones:
<ul><li> "Vidstan'" ("Let me be") , a song released in 2003 where the singer basically characterizes his girlfriend as bipolar and aggressive, and the chorus includes the lines "You moron, let me be, I'll kill you... I'll put poison in your tea". All that set to a lovely piano tune.
</li><li> "Shmata" ("Whore") released in 2007 where the singer accuses his girl of cheating on him while he was away on his military service.
</li><li> "Mumitroll", a song released on the same album as the above that starts as a love song... until its third line, then for the remainder of the song the singer threatens to mutilate his girl if she even disobeys him or cheats on him (basically a creepy song about domestic violence).
<ul><li> To add irony to that, the two songs were released on an album called "Pro lubov" ("About love") . Meanwhile, in real life, the singer/songwriter was happily married.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> "Taxidermy" by Erin Murray starts out as a normal lost-love ballad, until the singer starts explaining how she's going to keep him.
</li><li> Just about any song about relationships, sex or romance by The Buzzcocks.
</li><li> "Love comes in spurts" by Richard Hell and the Voidoids ("and it murders your heart/they didn't tell you that part")
</li><li> Psychobilly/Gothabilly bands seem particularly fond of singing terms of endearment at corpses, zombies, vampires, and other nasties, with tongues planted firmly in cheeks.
</li><li> Grace Potter and the Nocturnals' "Ah, Mary," which sounds enough like a normal love song, albeit a conflicted one to a terrifyingly disturbed woman, except is that the name is only used in the chorus, where it's always "Ah, Mary"... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunnyName">that's right</a>. It's made clear in the last refrain:
<div class="indent">"Ah, Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Eagleland">kaaa!</a>"
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBeatles">The Beatles</a> have a soft, lilting ballad called "Norwegian Wood" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution">about burning down a girl's apartment for being a cocktease.</a> Apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnLennon">John Lennon</a> was writing about an affair while trying not to let his wife know he was having one, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PaulMcCartney">Paul McCartney</a> thought it was a laugh to burn the place down at the end.
</li></ul><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NickCave">Nick Cave</a> and the Bad Seeds have "Where the Wild Roses Grow", which is about a tragic love affair. Of course, it's tragic because Nick Cave's character in the duet bashes Kylie Minogue's head in... Adding to the weirdness is the duet he and PJ Harvey recorded on the same album, "Henry Lee", where Harvey's character slits Cave's throat and dumps the corpse down a well mostly for spite. Depending on who you ask, this fits their brief relationship rather too well.
<ul><li> His album <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetLoveIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LetLoveIn">Let Love In</a></em> has the songs "Do You Love Me?" and "Loverman" (the latter even covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Metallica">Metallica</a>), which are sung from the perspective of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong">an obsessive, almost murderous man. </a>
</li></ul></li><li> "Fool" by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingElse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingElse">Everything Else</a> is a good example.

</div><ul><li> A few the songs from the above's album, <em>Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV Volume One</em>, fall into this, due to the narrator of songs like "Welcome Home" and "The Suffering" being a mentally unstable writer who has had a falling out with is girlfriend, and blames all of his problems on her leaving him.
</li></ul></li><li> A large portion of Xiu Xiu's back catalogue has made great use of this trope, covering many, if not all, of the various angles mentioned above.
<ul><li> Jennifer Lopez is a sort of open letter to the eponymous singer, asking if she ever gets upset about the fact that her music soundtracks so many mens broken hearts and sexual frustration in (presumably gay) bars around the world every Friday night.
</li><li> Sad Pony Guerilla Girl is surely in the running for "creepiest love song ever". Best case scenario is it's about a woman having a one sided affair with a married man, and being unhappy with the arrangement, but too in love with him to break it off. The song also alludes to him beating her up, and the line "I am your little girl" may or may not be intended literally.
</li><li> Perhaps the ultimate example is Fabulous Muscles. It's about a young gay man with a muscle fetish who unromantically fellates a closeted jock, who then freaks out and kills him. However, the song is delivered in a tone that suggests he's relatively ok with this scenario. Sample lyrics: "cremate me after you cum on my lips, honey boy. Place my ashes in a vase beneath your workout bench".
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCult">The Cult</a>'s "Love Removal Machine" is about the protagonist finding a quick hookup as a way of purging himself of his former SO.
</li><li> "The Truth Is...", the 2011 album by Theory Of A Deadman, is about 3/4 this. Mostly songs that are rather explicitly either "I hate my girlfriend I wish she'd leave" or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupSong">I hate that bitch, why did she treat me so bad before she left?</a>"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>, "Stupid Girl", spits vitriol over a particular type of female
<div class="indent"> I'm not talking about the way she gets her dough (Look at that stupid girl/Well I'm a talking about the way she grabs and holds! (Look at that stupid girl)
</div></li><li> "She is the New Thing" by the Horrors is one of these.
<div class="indent"> I wonder how long it will be
</div><div class="indent"> before I'm sick of her

</div></li><li> Shellac's "Prayer to God", which is about a person begging God to kill his ex and her lover. The narrator pleads for a delicate, painless death for her, but asks for an unsympathetic murder of the other guy.
</li><li> "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZHPOeOxQQ">You Give Love a Bad Name<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BonJovi">Bon Jovi</a> is basically a denunciation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfairSex">The Unfair Sex</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The Format's "Inches and Falling" sounds at first like an overly sappy affair - it starts with the line "I love love, I love being in love" - but it soon becomes clear that the lyrics are incredible facetious.
<div class="indent">I love love, I love being in love.
</div><div class="indent">I don't care what it does to me.

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/GunsNRoses">Axl Rose's</a> friend Michelle Young told him while both heard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">"Your Song"</a> that she always wanted a song about her. He tried writing a pretty ballad... but then decided to write a rocker that translated her carefree life (with only a somewhat romantic message in the bridge), "My Michelle". She approved as it was honest.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Garbage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Garbage">Garbage</a> have a few, like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObsessionSong">Obsession Song</a> "#1 Crush", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere-in-love</a> "Vow" and the self-explanatory "I Hate Love".
</li><li> Local H's "Lovey Dovey", although it's heavily implied that the narrator hates seeing loving couples so much because of jealousy - the chorus includes the line "It's not fair", and one verse discusses a couple that he constantly sees bickering with each other, and concludes "I kind of like that / I kind of need that".
</li><li> Brett Anderson's "The Empress" is may be a strange and melancholy song about a failed love affair, or it may describe some weirder sort of bad relationship. The first line is definitely "Didn't I try to love her?"
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathCabForCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DeathCabForCutie">Death Cab for Cutie</a> has quite a few songs that could qualify. Some notable examples:
<ul><li> "You Can Do Better Than Me" is a jangly, cheerful-sounding tune about someone who clings to an unhappy relationship because he knows he'll never find anything better.
</li><li> "The Sound of Settling" is an upbeat anthem about, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">settling</a> for less than the best.
</li><li> In "Someday You Will Be Loved," the narrator leaves a girl an encouraging note about how she will find love in time... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotStayingForBreakfast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotStayingForBreakfast">as he abandons her after a one night stand.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> "Flowers of Flesh and Blood" by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NicoleDollanganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NicoleDollanganger">Nicole Dollanganger</a>. Whole song, but a single line says it all:
<div class="indent"> How come no one ever told me love was like <br/>Being fucked with a knife?
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReignOfKindo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheReignOfKindo">The Reign of Kindo</a> has their song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rVEy0zDh6E">"Romancing a Stranger"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, about the futility of unrequited love. From the second line, the singer is already fully aware that "She doesn't love me," yet he still wastes a lot of time and effort on the girl, which eventually leads him to realize, "How pathetic that I care for the romance of a stranger's wanting eyes/Oh, she doesn't love me..."
</li><li> "Everything About You" by Ugly Kid Joe fits this quite well.
<div class="indent">I... get sick when I'm around <br/>I... can't stand to be around <br/>I... hate everything about you
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheCars">The Cars</a>' "Just What I Needed", upon closer inspection, comes off as being about being happy with a friends-with-benefits setup <em>because</em> neither party is in love and can have casual sex while not having to worry about the setup being complicated by one or both parties developing actual feelings.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JoanJett">Joan Jett</a> song <em>Jezebel</em>, about a woman who's angry at her ex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">something awful they did</a> and doesn't want to see them ever again.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BIGMAMA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BIGMAMA">BIGMAMA</a>'s "Thank You is Fxxk You" starts out as a gentle song about the virtues of saying "thank you" instead of "I'm sorry"... until the narrator changed his mind about it when he met a girl who said "thanks" in response to his multiple love confessions. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicFBomb">He curses her out for it once it's all said and done.</a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TwistedSister">Twisted Sister</a>'s "Love Is For Suckers", which is a rant about men who are total suckers that would do anything for love... even the singer during the breakdown, when he tries to resist Little Miss Perfect's attempt to get back together with him and ends up falling for it when he says, "You what? You will? With your heels on?"

<ul><li> Subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TraceAdkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TraceAdkins">Trace Adkins</a>' "This Ain't No Love Song". Although he says that he's driving by her house and can't sleep at night but <em>isn't</em> in love, the song's tone and lyrics make it obvious that he <em>knows</em> he's in love, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">she knows he knows, and he knows she knows he knows</a>.
</li><li> "You're the Hangnail in My Life" by Hoyt Axton.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash">Johnny Cash</a> sang a touching lost love ballad titled "Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart" (written by his producer Jack Clement). You can hear the convicts laughing during the song.
</li><li> Roy Clark's "Thank God and Grayhound (You're Gone)" starts as if the singer is sorry to see his former love leave. The lyrics soon make it clear that he's anything but.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlanJackson">Alan Jackson</a>'s "Three Minute Positive Not Too Country Uptempo Love Song" is a parody of... well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>.
</li><li> Jaron and the Long Road to Love (really Jaron Lowenstein of Evan and Jaron) wrote a country song called "Pray for You". Though very few would mistake its meaning once the chorus starts.
<div class="indent">I haven't been to church since I don't remember when
</div><div class="indent">Things were going great 'til they fell apart again
</div><div class="indent">So I listened to the preacher as he told me what to do
</div><div class="indent">He said you can't go hatin' others who have done wrong to you
</div><div class="indent">Sometimes we get angry but we must not condemn
</div><div class="indent">Let the good Lord do his job, you just pray for them
<p></p></div><div class="indent">I pray your brakes go out runnin' down a hill
</div><div class="indent">I pray a flowerpot falls from a window sill
</div><div class="indent">And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
</div><div class="indent">I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
</div><div class="indent">I pray you're flyin' high when your engine stalls
</div><div class="indent">I pray all your dreams never come true
</div><div class="indent">Just know wherever you are, honey, I pray for you
</div></li><li> You might think just from the title that Jack Ingram's "Love You" is a love song, but the first verse makes it plain that it's not ("the heck with this, the heck with us"), and then the chorus starts: "Love you, love this town / Love this motherlovin' truck that keeps breakin' lovin' down."
</li><li> Jessica Lea Mayfield's song, "For Today" is a subliminal anti-love song:
<div class="indent"> And while these words may sound so sweet
</div><div class="indent"> I could care less about you
</div><div class="indent"> Care less about you
</div><div class="indent"> And I love the sound of you walking away
</div></li><li> "Goodbye Earl" by the Dixie Chicks, which is a lighthearted, peppy song about an abusive husband and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderBallad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderBallad">deservedly unpleasant end</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KelseaBallerini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KelseaBallerini">Kelsea Ballerini</a>'s "I Hate Love Songs", which has a traditional romantic melody but the lyrics are all about how "I hate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">Shakespeare</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanGosling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RyanGosling">Gosling</a> and cakes with white frosting; two names in a heart-shaped tattoo./I think cupid is stupid and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RosesAreRedVioletsAreBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RosesAreRedVioletsAreBlue">violets are purple, not blue</a>." She declares that she <em>does</em> love who she's singing to at the end of the chorus, but it's a weird way of showing it.
