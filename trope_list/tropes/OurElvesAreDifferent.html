Elves originated in Germanic mythology as a common type of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent">fairy folk</a>, the term sometimes being simply synonymous with "fairy". In the British isles, Anglo-Saxon elf myths eventually mingled with those Celtic supernatural beings. Later on, elves and fairies (largely synonymous by this point) were sanitized into diminutive woodland humanoids prone to tricks and teasing but ultimately benevolent. This image is where the modern-day concept of tiny, helpful elves in green clothes and/or pointy hats, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasElves">Santa's helpers</a>, ultimately comes from.
<div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Then, in 1954, Tolkien published <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>. The work based its Elves on both Germanic light elves and a vision of a humanity that did not fall from Eden. The resultant Elves were very human-like in physical appearance, but immortal, magical, and much more closely connected to the supernatural world, in addition to possessing a tendency to inhabit isolated villages and ancient forests. <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> greatly influenced later fantasy fiction, and in this manner also served as the maker of the modern interpretation of elves.
</p><p>Modern-day fantasy elves tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demihuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Demihuman">very human-like</a>, but distinguished by their pointed ears, much longer lives and closer connection to magic and nature. They however tend to be much more "grounded" than either folkloric or Tolkienian elves. In settings where both fairies and elves exist they are typically distinct creatures, with elves being typically more similar to humans than to fairies. In some cases, however, they may have a closer link to fairies and their world than other humanoids do, or be outright descended from them.

</p><ul><li> Human-sized, or about that size. They'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">lithe and nimble but physically fragile</a>, bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">Better than you, me, and even other elves</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EspeciallyZoidberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EspeciallyZoidberg">Especially</a></em> other elves, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">they won't let you forget it</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">nor will they accept any arguments to the contrary</a>. The flavor of this betterness will vary across stories and authors between all-natural, magical, or just plain nasty.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PointyEars">Pointy Ears</a>. The exact pointyness varies. Some favor "humanlike with a point at the tip", while others go with thin, triangular ears a foot long.
</li><li> Long lifespans. These may range from a century through several to outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">agelessness</a>. Methods include outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Immortality">immortality</a> to reincarnation to simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WizardsLiveLonger">significantly longer than humans</a>. Even if they're not immortal, they're not likely to suffer the effects of old age.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> Magical in one way or another, either from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">highly spiritual</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">innately magical</a> or producers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">magitek</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InhumanlyBeautifulRace">Very, very pretty</a>. Very often they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate">of androgynous appearance</a>, and rarely have facial hair.
</li><li> In decline — they may be descended from a great civilization that collapsed in the past, be in the middle of cultural decline now, or be an outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a>. In any case, their glories are behind them now.
</li><li> Will either be exceptionally chaste and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexEqualsLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexEqualsLove">only have sex within the bounds of true love</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EthicalSlut">sexually liberated and probably polyamorous</a>, depending on which the author considers more appropriate for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">Superior Species</a>.
</li><li> Anything they make is likewise beautiful, more durable, more delicious, and just plain <em>better</em> than human wares. However, sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeSterility">they lack a certain creative flair</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">A strong warrior tradition</a>, albeit one that is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">more refined than most</a>. On an individual level, Elves tend to wield elegant, graceful weapons (such as scimitars, rapiers, katanas, daggers, spears, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">especially</a> longbows) instead of large crushing weapons. They are commonly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a> in their fighting styles, relative to other races. On a wider scale, expect an elven fighting force to utilise mobility and stealth over brute force, with lots of magical backup (or simply be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Badass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy">Elite Army</a> - after all if you live for millennia outside of violence or accident, you can get <em>really</em> good at fighting).
</li><li> And of course, there's usually more than just one type of elf.
</li></ul><p>In modern fantasy fiction, it's exceedingly common for elves to come in multiple breeds. This probably comes from real folklore, where <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifications_of_fairies">nearly every culture had its own division<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for fairies. Scottish folklore gave us the Seelie and Unseelie Courts<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note084i1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note084i1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note084i1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Seelie" is etymologically related to "silly", and in this context means "happy" - "seelie" fairies are generally friendly or at least not hostile, whereas "unseelie" ones bring misfortune and malice</span> (nowadays often associated with summer and winter). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WBYeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WBYeats">W. B. Yeats</a> divided Irish fairies into "Trooping" and "Solitary" fairies.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1lovn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1lovn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1lovn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"Trooping" fairies are the Aos Sí, the classic "High Elf" type whose leaders actually come from Ireland's pre-Christian pantheon, like the Dagda. The name refers to folktales of people witnessing their courtly procession through the country. "Solitary" fairies covers the small fairies that meddle, play tricks or help around houses, like leprechauns and clurichauns.</span> And Scandinavian fairies were broken into Dökkálfar and Ljósálfar, "dark" and "light" fairies. Scandinavia also gave us Svartálfar, black elves, which might actually be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarfs</a>. In the modern era, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> re-codified Elves slightly into "High" and "Wood" elves. When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> added its underground "dark elves", modelled after the Prose Edda's Svartálfar and renamed "drow"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2b7s3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2b7s3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2b7s3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Etymologically derived from the same root as "troll", and in folklore records also spelled "trow".</span>, the archetypal trinity was complete.
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>High Elves</strong>:
<ul><li> They'll frequently be part of an ancient civilization/kingdom that has been in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a> since before human speech. Unlike their more down-to-earth compatriots, they'll usually live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity">Shining City</a>. Thanks largely to their longevity, these elves tend to dedicate a lot of time to perfecting their arts, crafts and skills. So everything from their poetry and cuisine to architecture and armor tends to be highly advanced, meticulously intricate and aesthetically impressive. Usually <em>very</em> proficient with magic and producing magical items and artifacts. They often have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteImmortality">Complete Immortality</a>, too.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalRapier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalRapier">Rapiers</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">bows</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeOnAStick">spears</a> are favored weapons for their ground forces, with the option of sleek scimitars in settings where rapiers are too modern, and their warriors typically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">prioritize technique and skill over raw power</a>. If these guys have any weakness at all , it will usually be that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">slimmer and more delicate physically</a> than both the other types of elves and humans and dwarves, which means that while they're nearly always better magicians than humans, they are not always going to win a physical fight.
</li><li> If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">Can't Argue with Elves</a> is in play in a story, these will be the elves you can't argue with, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSuper">they won't hesitate to remind you at every opportunity</a>. Usually the most insufferably arrogant of elves, though they may not necessarily be openly antagonistic; they're often portrayed as looking down on other races, sometimes to the degree of full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>. This may extend to other kinds of elves as well. If they live in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity">Shining City</a>, it will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">invariably be cleaner than human cities</a>. They're usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeForm">physically superior in "every way that counts"</a>, which is to say they don't count others' strengths as worthwhile.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Wood Elves</strong>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">In tune with nature</a> and often prone to spiritual contemplation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpath">empathy</a>. Generally they're magical in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsMagic">druidic</a> rather than wizardly way.
</li><li> They can be found in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Village</a> in a forest and/or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeTopTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreeTopTown">Tree Top Town</a>. Wood Elves may be good-natured guardians and/or guides for the forest and for people who travel through them, while darker takes on the Wood Elves may present them as either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicNeutral">totally apathetic to anything going on outside the forest borders</a>, or worse, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist">ruthless isolationists</a> who view any non-elf in their forest as a trespasser to be hunted down and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">"removed"</a>. If there's some kind of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants">tree-people</a>, they will probably be friends.
</li><li> They tend to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">associated even more with archery</a> than their High Elf kin, but will also use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnifeNut">knives and short swords</a>. Often, their weapons will be depicted as less ornate and more functional than High Elves', too. They may not necessarily be made of metal either - bone, antler and other natural materials are common alternatives. Sometimes they'll resemble a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalNativeAmerican">Magical Native American</a>.

If High Elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">are arrogant and snobbish</a> or just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace">distant and spiritual</a>, Wood Elves will be the ones you can go drinking with. They're usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoldlyComing">the ones responsible</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">half-elves</a> (unless the half-elf <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">has great storytelling significance</a>, in which case they'll probably be a High Elf hybrid), but they may replace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">Cultural Posturing</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop">lectures on respecting nature</a>. If High Elves are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elfeminate">impossibly beautiful or somewhat androgynous</a>, Wood Elves will usually be less so.
</li><li> They also tend to be close allies with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent">fairies</a> (if they, or elves in general, are not fairies themselves). If the fiction uses the traditional Scottish Seelie/Unseelie division they may be the more mischevous or malicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">fair folk</a> .
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Dark Elves (often called <em>Drow</em>)</strong>:
<ul><li> Dark Elves are usually closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, except these guys are organized as cities or civilizations and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">bent on evil</a>, rather than "just" operating on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">alien morality</a>.
</li><li> They typically have dark grey, black or blue-black skin and bone-white hair, or extremely gaunt and pale. Despite living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth">in caves</a>, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsSexy">still gorgeous</a>. Unlike other Elves, some Dark Elves may have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeardOfEvil">facial hair</a>.
</li><li> These guys will wear <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMakeover">black leather bondage gear</a> when they aren't wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpikesOfVillainy">Spikes of Villainy</a>, speak in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech">Black Speech</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">kick dogs</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">and steal cable</a>. In particular, they are often depicted as having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt">labyrinthine, corrupt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">lethal</a> internal politics, and as having a tendency to extreme sadism, with anyone unlucky enough to be captured by them doomed to suffer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">extremely protracted</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">imaginative</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a>.
</li><li> They may also be philosophers like their High Elf brethren, but prefer more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Darwinistic</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist">nihilistic</a> views on the world. Other races are seen at best like livestock, and you <em>really</em> don't want to know what it's like at the worst. If they're not into philosophy, they will often be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEngineer">The Engineer</a> (sometimes referencing their Scandinavian folkloric origin as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">another name for dwarves</a>). If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesVsDwarves">there are dwarves too</a>, they'll be the engineers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWeaponEvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodWeaponEvilWeapon">who make the nasty, evil weapons</a>. If they use blades, they'll be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerratedBladeOfPain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerratedBladeOfPain">serrated</a></em>. They may have also devised very elaborate and interesting ways of killing their enemies.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>Some common varieties beyond those three include:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Sea Elves</strong>: Generally an aquatic equivalent to Wood Elves. They tend to be physically identical to "normal" elves, sometimes taking an exception for a discreet set of gills, webbing between their toes, or blue or green <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazingTechnicolorPopulation">skin</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouGottaHaveBlueHair">hair</a>. Sea Elves, when they aren't a more down-to-earth seafaring subset of the High Elves, live in beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity">Underwater Cities</a> built out of coral or natural grottos. They may be able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animorphism">turn into sea animals</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolphinsDolphinsEverywhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DolphinsDolphinsEverywhere">usually dolphins</a>) and even if they can't they'll be friendly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientCetaceans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientCetaceans">dolphins</a>, sea serpents and similar creatures.
</li><li> <strong>Snow Elves</strong>: Elves that live in cold climates, and we don't mean the ones who work for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SantaClaus">big red guy</a>. Relatively rare, and more elusive than even the Wood Elves. They also tend to be a little less arrogant, because the Northern/Southern wastes are too damn cold for that stuff.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Elves</a></strong>: These guys have half the coolness of their elf parent, but half the suck of their human side (including mortality, or worse by far, facial hair). They are usually outcasts, or if not, they have embraced one of their parentages to the exclusion of the other (usually the Elf part, because humans suck). Living in human society gives them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angst">Angst</a> rating on par with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyNeighborhoodVampire">Friendly Neighborhood Vampire</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>: Elves are the default humanoid creature type for Green, the color of nature and tradition. Most of them qualify as High Elves or Wood Elves, but a few unusual varieties show up on some planes:
<ul><li> The elves of the plane Lorwyn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruct</a> this trope. They have ram-like horns, though they can't really be compared to humanity, as Lorwyn has no humans. However, they do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun">look down on</a> the kithkin (i.e., <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hobbits">hobbits</a>). In addition, their entire society is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeautifulElite">based on physical beauty</a>, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">most beautiful</a> among them being worshiped as gods. In contrast to the typical nature-loving elf, they take it upon themselves to "improve" upon nature to make it more beautiful. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterRace">Beings that are not beautiful -- mostly other races and disfigured elves -- are labeled "Eyeblights" and routinely exterminated.</a>
</li><li> In Lorwyn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilTwin">Evil Twin</a> plane, Shadowmoor, the elves are the only race that isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>. In Lorwyn, the elves believed themselves to be the stewards of beauty and perfection; in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> of Shadowmoor, they <em>are</em>.
</li><li> The biometallic plane of Mirrodin, where the line between organic life and metal got rather blurred, was home to elves that grew complex spikes and sheets of copper from their bodies.
</li><li> While the Selesnyan elves of Ravnica are fairly standard, the Devkarin elves of the Golgari Swarm deviate from the trope standard by being dedicated necromancers obsessed with rot and death. There are also the elves of the Simic Combine—bald, largely extinct, and almost uniformly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a>, and generally disliked by the other two types. They're technically all still Wood Elves, but the Devkarin are more focused on the "death" part of the cycle of life and death, and the Simic elves get a bit... creative in their goal of preserving life.
</li><li> By <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, there used to be elves living in the gothic horror-inspired plane of Innistrad, too, but they were driven to extinction by the plane's many native horrors.
</li><li> Most of Magic's elves reject technology, because they're associated with green mana. Kaladesh's elves, on the other hand, are skilled artificers, because Wizards of the Coast concluded it was a bit boring if the place of green in every artifact set was solely based on rejecting it (a la Mirrodin, home of elves with Protection from Artifacts). Kaladeshi elves are deeply attuned to the flow of aether, and many focus on building robot animals and integrating living components like wood and vines into their machinery — <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=417739">Peema Outrider<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for example, has a gold-and-wood steed.

The High Elves, Blue Elves, and Wood Elves are more moral and wise than Humans because they are closer to the world of Arran, whom they consider a god in itself. However, the Wood Elves are highly xenophobic toward Humans. The Dark Elves are an immoral, murderous kind, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series being a Dark Elf herself. Lastly, the Half-Elves take from their human heritage and more or less act like any Human would.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Wolfrider elves are Wood Elves played fairly straight; they're smaller than the (very) primitive humans around them and only slightly more advanced. They do have supernatural powers, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingHands">healing</a> and the ability to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DishingOutDirt">shape rock and wood</a>, but most of them only have the power to communicate telepathically (referred to as "sending") and very few are able to heal or do rock and wood-shaping. Oh, and of all the elves only the Wolfriders have facial hair due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their part-wolf ancestry</span>.
</li><li> The Gliders, before they <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all died and their spirits went to the Palace of the High Ones</span>, and Savah, the Sun Folk's Mother of Memory, follow the High Elf archetype more, although several are considerably less haughty than is typical for this type. They're larger than the Wolfriders, due to their greater age — becoming smaller over generations was an adaptation to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the new world</span>, and the Gliders in particular haven't had any new children in forever when first met.

The same psychological rules generally apply though, as Two-Edge uses his cunning throughout the series to force the other characters through "games" of his devising, in an attempt to reconcile the two halves of his heritage. Interestingly, his mental and emotional troubles were not caused by prejudice towards his hybrid nature <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but by his mother using her psionic powers to drive him mad, in order to hide the crimes she did to his father</span>.
</li><li> It's not until late in the series that the reader discovers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all the elves are really the descendants of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Space Elves</a> who were trapped on the planet ages ago.

The elf character Motor-Oil is a bumbling wreck after losing his girlfriend. Also, his name is <em>Motor-Oil</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChildOfTheStorm">Child of the Storm</a></em> has multiple versions:
<ul><li> The Alfar of the Nine Realms are (possibly were in the case of the Svartalves — it's left ambiguous) fairly Tolkien-esque High Elves, and are biologically immortal, naturally very good-looking, slimmer than humans and Asgardians, and excellent marksmen — though Clint Barton is a match for even their best. Like the rest of the Nine Realms, they've also got extremely high-end <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>, and even more than most: they're a match for Asgard. Unlike most depictions, their morality and egotism runs the spectrum. They are — or were — divided into two tribes that ultimately differed on ideological grounds.
<ul><li> The "Light Elves" of Alfheim are Asgard's most loyal allies. They're particularly Tolkien-esque — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>, their Prince, Faradei, was the inspiration for Legolas. One of them, Algrim (who's purple due to a rather strange skin disorder) is Odin's Chamberlain and one of his best Advisers, who helped raise Thor and Loki and now advises them too. However, they're not all good: Gravemoss, arguably the vilest member of the first book's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadEnsemble">Big Bad Ensemble</a>, was banished for necromancy and being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompleteMonster">Complete Monster</a>. He's functionally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Humanoid Abomination</a> and permanent resident of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncannyValley">Uncanny Valley</a> who regards life as being wasted on the living, and dreams of ruling over a universe of the dead.
</li><li> The "Dark Elves" of Svartalfheim aren't, in fact, classic Dark Elves. Instead, they're a faction of the Alfar as a whole who, under their leader, Malekith the Accursed, weren't content with being second to Asgard. They felt that they should be at the top of Yggdrasil and leading/ruling the Nine Realms, which they intended to rearrange by force. Considering their power (they were more or less on par with Asgard) and that Malekith had the Aether a.k.a. the Reality Stone, they came dangerously close to succeeding, and the only way they could be stopped was by pounding Svartalfheim a.k.a. 'the Dark World' flat, resulting in a ruined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> from orbit.
</li><li> At least some survived, with dissidents fleeing Malekith's purges and some of Malekith's surviving supporters both escaping to other realms, primarily Earth. The former have a small but respected nation in the Nevernever (Faerie) and are noted to have evolved to become something much more like the Fae than they were originally. It's uncertain whether any of the latter are still around (or what happened to them), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has implied that Malekith is both alive and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> better known these days as Oberon</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> There are also the Sidhe, the humanoid aristocracy of the Seelie (Summer) and Unseelie (Winter) Courts of Faerie, as well as independent lesser 'Wyldfae' Courts. Classic examples of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, they're not related to the Alfar (except for the Svartalves of Faerie, who emigrated). Instead, they were a subspecies of humanity (hinted to be the Denisovans) that entered Faerie several hundred thousand years ago, and their population is supported by/includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">changelings, humans who have a fae parent</a>.

</li><li> Stone Elves who have Chalk white skin, and are usually divided into ones of two class types, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Scholar</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Fighter</a>. They are also the most likely to fall into the Dark Elf stereotype.

</li><li> Drae/Vornae. Despite looking like D&amp;D Drow they are <em>not</em> Dark Elves but rather have a culture very much like samurai Japan. No one except them are quite sure about the Drae/Vornae divide as they look and generally act exactly alike except that the Vornae seem to be the higher caste.

They're never taller than a human adolescent, but beyond that there are fat ones, sweaty ones, ones with skin problems (on those pointy ears, no less), a <em>lot</em> of foul-mouthed ones and facial hair.

They live in more or less normal societies, though with social norms closer to 21st-century "Western" standards than anyone else in Selenoth, such as greater equality between the sexes. There are some bits of "uncanny valley" weirdness about them; for example, the sound of their laughter strikes humans as oddly disturbing. Also, magic is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VirginPower">Virgin Power</a> for female elves.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfImaginaryBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BookOfImaginaryBeings">Book of Imaginary Beings</a></em> has them as the strictly fairytale kind. Elves, or alps, are tiny, mischievous beings and rarely seen by people, and cause a great deal of mischief. They steal cattle and children, lie on sleepers' breasts to cause troubled dreams, tie hair into knots and shoot tiny iron arrows that vanish into the skin without a trace and cause sudden painful stitches.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bordertown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Bordertown">Bordertown</a></em> has a different type of elf — most onscreen are punked-out and rock-music-loving. However, they are all tall, slender, and silver-haired and -eyed, they are unashamedly magical, and as a race they seem to have a permanent case of incredible arrogance.

The elves left for unknown lands, and have not been seen by the people of the Emerged World since.

</li><li> The humans and elves, in the time during which they shared the Emerged World, mingled to create a new species, the half-elves. Little is known about them either, as the Tyrant killed nearly all of them, except that they had pointy ears, blue hair and purple eyes, that they were skilled astronomers, and that they ruled the Land of Days before the Tyrant's time.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CodexAlera">Codex Alera</a></em>: The Marat are graceful, white-haired humanoids who are mildly telepathic and live in harmony with nature — not strictly wood-elves, but they fill the same basic niche. They form lifelong bonds with individual animals at puberty, and before this point have eyes that shimmer in every color — after bonding, their eyes settle into the same shade as their partner creature's. It's worth noting, though, that while they're presented as being morally superior to the human Alerans in some ways (notably, the Alerans keep slaves, which the Marat find abhorrent), in others they can be a remarkably savage people (cannibalism is fairly common).

(Ironically, Alfeim has become an overcrowded housing project because all elves crave the honor of living there, and since they don't die, the population just goes up and up. Or so our semi-reliable source says). There are two variants of Elves. Most of the elves were made in North America and are tall, elegant and dignified and basically fill the High Elf role. Bast is quite a bit shorter, has a wicked sense of humor, was a prototype made in Japan and is basically a Wood Elf. Or as she puts it, she's a cheap Japanese knockoff.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDeathGateCycle">The Death Gate Cycle</a></em> has several variations:
<ul><li> The Tribus elves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">Arianus</a> are essentially Dark Elves — a corrupt and decadent empire ruled by cutthroat politics and sinister magic, who rule tyrannically over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarves</a> and used to do the same over the humans before the latter rebelled. However, they weren't always like this, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">Prince Rees'ahn</a> is an elf who leads a rebellion against the current regime in the hope of restoring the earlier ideals.
</li><li> The Equilan elves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollowWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollowWorld">Pryan</a> are the most human-like, being essentially Victorian English with long lifespans, pointy ears and magic, complete with the condescendingly racist attitudes towards every other culture and nation.
</li><li> The Elmas elves of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterIsAir" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterIsAir">Chelestra</a> are more of a benign version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>. They can be very, very odd, and most humans and dwarves have little understanding of (or patience with) their culture, but they are deeply devoted to peace and harmony and are explicitly stated to have found a level of wisdom that their cousins on the other worlds did not.
</li><li> In an inversion of how this trope is usually played, the elves (whose magic is mostly suited to making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> and enchanted objects) are generally <em>less</em> attuned to the natural world than the humans (who instead tend towards elemental and mental magic) are: it's a great irritation for the Tribus elves that they cannot replicate the magic humans use to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider">tame and ride dragons</a>, while the humans of Pryan are better farmers than the Equilan elves, who have yet to master basic crop rotation and are dependent on food imports from human lands.
</li><li> However, the race that picks up most of the "ancient, magical, arrogant and self-righteous" High Elf stereotypes aren't elves at all; this particular elven niche is filled by the human-derived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">Sartan</a>, who look down on elves just as much as they do humans and dwarves.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Demonwars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Demonwars">Demonwars</a></em>: The elves craft weapons of incredible power, make magic items vastly beyond the ken of other races (a healing bandanna of theirs keeps a centaur alive after he's crushed in a cave-in), and appear to be the only Good race to possess souls (this is implied to be false).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragaera">Dragaera</a></em> has the Dragaerans. They stand an average of seven feet tall and have lifespans exceeding 1,000 years. They have slender builds and do not grow facial hair. The race was created when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Jenoine</a> combined human stock with various animals to create various strains, which organized into Houses of the Dragaeran Empire. Some of these strains have pointed ears, though not all. Interestingly, they refer to themselves as humans and practice <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> towards actual humans, whom they refer to as "Easterners." In some areas, they're called "elfs" and call humans "dwarfs."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> gives us Tanis (half-elf, reject), as well as the Qualinesti (High Elves) and extremely stratified, isolationist Silvanesti (Grey Elves), the latter of whom are incredibly arrogant and xenophobic. This comes to hurt them after their refusal to seek help from the other races, and the Qualinesti, causes their country to become magically entrapped in a horrific nightmare-made-real. Later books also introduce the Kagonesti (Wood Elves as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">Noble Savages</a>). There is also Dalamaar the Dark Elf (which in <em>Dragonlance</em> isn't a race so much as individual elves being exiled from the elven nations), who's just as arrogant and haughty as the other elves, but also evil. Elves generally seem to the collective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> of the <em>Dragonlance</em> setting: Qualinesti was invaded twice inside thirty years, occupied for forty years and then destroyed by a green dragon. Silvanesti was turned into a nightmare realm by a (different) green dragon, was "protected" by a magical shield that turned out to be sucking out the life force of all the Elves and was then invaded and colonized by the minotaurs. Currently, both elven kingdoms are in exile led (in a satisfying bit of irony) by the part human son of the despised Tanis.

This is explicitly because they are regular humans who've been enhanced by some very complex magic. In fact, humans are periodically transformed into new Elantrians, and this is implied to be the main source of Elantris' inhabitants.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElricSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElricSaga">The Elric Saga</a></em>: The Melniboneans are a mix of High Elf, Dark Elf, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Decadent</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Empire on the Wane</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, although they do bear more obvious similarities to several societies' deities — intentionally. The trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggingTrope">zigzagged</a> a good deal more with the other sub-series in the Champion Eternal Cycle, with different branches/versions of the Eldren in other dimensions (including the Vadhagh, Corum's people, who are classic High Elves) shown mostly according to this trope, while still having a strong hint of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElvenWays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheElvenWays">The Elven Ways</a></em>: The Vaelinar (the elves of the series) are largely of the High Elf variety. The Vaelinar are members of two opposing armies of an alien race that arrived on the world of Kerith, after being hit with a magical weapon known as "The Hammer of War". These alien elves have all the physical characteristics of the High Elf sort (though they appear to be physically stronger than humans) and many possess innate magical talents. The elves have carved a prominent place in the world for several reasons — they have a monopoly on magic when the gods of Kerith removed it from the native races, they were more advanced technologically, and due to the alienness of their nature — the elves can use summon magic to coerce the gods of Kerith (something the gods of their old world were almost immune to). The only reasons they haven't conquered Kerith is their small infertile population and their desire to return their original dimension. Elven superiority goes up a notch in the final 2 books, it turns out that the Elven gods are all previously mortal elves who were powerful enough to achieve apotheosis and are more than a match for any Kerith god. This leads to a race against time to prevent an invasion by the Elves of the original Vaelinar homeworld.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForbiddenTowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheForbiddenTowers">The Forbidden Towers</a></em>, a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book in the <em>Fantasy Forest</em> series, elves can live for hundreds of years, jump really high/far, "disappear" (teleport), and by quickly rubbing their thumb across their other fingers create the "elven spark" — a tiny bolt of electricity which can stun small enemies and start fires. It's not really clear how well they get along with humans, though some creatures <em>do</em> apparently like to eat elves in particular.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForestOfBolandLightRailway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ForestOfBolandLightRailway">Forest of Boland Light Railway</a></em>: The wood elves are known as Cowsies, and help the gnomes drive the goblins out of the forest. In gratitude the elves get to ride the train for free.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GarrettPI">Garrett, P.I.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dark elves don't live underground, are nihilists, and dress like they just walked out of the medieval edition of <em>GQ</em>. Morley Dotes, the protagonist's sort-of-friend, fits the half-elf trope minus the low self-esteem, as he's half dark elf and has inherited several levels of badass from his elven side (multiclassing in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Chick Magnet</a>).
</li><li> High elves stick with their image, including being bigoted against their own half-elven offspring. Seldom seen in the novels, they're a bunch of uptight snobs, albeit more middle-class than "noble".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GreenRider">Green Rider</a></em> has the Elt or Eletians, elves in all but name. They're incredibly arrogant and very conscious of how much innate magic they have compared to humans. On occasion, though, the human characters will call them on it—and on how unhelpful they can be when the fate of the world is at stake. The trope is also subverted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the villain of the first book is an Eletian gone bad</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>: The House Elves are ugly, diminutive humanoids who serve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a> to wizards and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessInSlavery">perfectly happy with this</a>. They rather more closely fit the description of brownies or some of the earlier legends of kobolds, though; they're <em>called</em> elves, but they're not really elves as this particular trope page describes them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHollows">The Hollows</a></em>: Elves are a large departure from the usual depiction. They look much like humans (though some crop their ears to blend in) and only live a couple of centuries as opposed to the typical near immortality. They are a little faster and stronger than humans, and while they can use magic, this is not unique to their race nor are they any better at it than any other. However, some practice what is called "wild magic", which comes from gods and is unpredictable but powerful. They pass as 'old money' humans to blend into society and maintain the remnants of feudalism. In fact, they have a lot of human blood thanks to interbreeding to try to stave off extinction due to genetic damage that causes a high infant mortality rate. They lack the connection to nature most other types of elves have, but in an interesting example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernMagik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostModernMagik">Post-Modern Magik</a>, they are heavily invested in illegal genetic engineering technology, as they seek to repair their genome.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InheritanceCycle">Inheritance Cycle</a></em>: The elves are vegetarian, atheist, and possess superhuman physical strength and speed that allows them to best the most well-trained humans. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">They are every bit as arrogant and elitist as expected</a>, view humans as too corruptible to be trusted with power and the dwarves as misguided zealots who, because they believe in gods, must surely be idiots who ignore all reason and logic. They're also masters of deception, and while they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotTellALie">never actually lie</a>, they are known for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaphoricallyTrue">never revealing the whole truth, or saying something but meaning something different.</a> Eragon briefly adopts their vegetarian lifestyle, but relents on it in the next book, and rejects their notions of atheism altogether. In the third book, a being that may have been one of the dwarf gods appears, implying that the elves may be wrong about that particular belief. They also consider humans primitive and brutish, while they rely on innate (read: primitively instinctual) magic to beat the humans' siege engines, crossbows, and superior forging (the elf weapons are only "better" because they are imbued with spells and such.)
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IronElves">Iron Elves</a></em>: There are the elves of the Long Watch, who bond at birth with trees called Siver Oaks, some to the point where they become functionally insane and eventually lapse into catatonia. Then there are Iron Elves, who are born with black ear tips, cannot bond with trees but, unlike the elves of the Long Watch can use iron. Originally such elves were left exposed to die, where they were scooped up and recruited by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Black Monarch</a>. There are also the Elfkynan who live on the other side of the Cahlaran Empire, look like Long Watch elves and, except for the tree bonding act like them but neither they nor the Long Watch consider them elves.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Janus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Janus">Janus</a></em>: The Iftin are both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Space Elves</a> — they are (or rather, were) the original native intelligent species of the planet Janus — and Wood Elves. They were wiped out long before the arrival of human colonists, but set traps to create changelings so that their race would continue. Messing with any of the traps causes the person handling it to fall ill with the Green Sick, after which one is physically Iftin — green-skinned, pointy-eared, and bald — and carries some memories of an original Ift person, generally those memories geared toward survival skills, such as recognizing edible plants. The Janus novels play the trope straight — the traps cause the victims to become xenophobic toward their former kind; they theorize that this was at least partly intended to keep them from trying to resume their former lives.

They were deliberately birthed by the goblin queen to be labour (and occasionally livestock). Elves are encouraged by their goblin masters to breed so the local ecosystem can get something to fill a niche (an elf mating with an elf leads to random creatures). Elves go into our world to scavenge junk and occasionally mate with humans (elves can only be consistently born when an elf mates with a human who has some elven ancestry), and elves going to Earth tend to get killed by muggers. Their immortality is only a side-effect of living in another dimension, and a human living there gets the same effect.

Welfie elders communicate only psionically. All Welfies can change their size and do so as a matter of fashion. When they're small, they live in mushrooms and housing shortages are created when tall Welfies are <em>a la mode</em>. Female Welfies are expected to remain subservient and "foot it fleetly upon the merry greensward, ho" whilst gathering flowers and moonbeams and generally being all pretty and stuff.

The Sithi are a mix of High Elf and Wood Elf traits, and are generally benevolent, if isolationist; the Norns are arctic Dark Elves and extremely nasty customers — while the Sithi aren't exactly fond of humanity, the Norns think the only good human is a dead human.

They <em>do</em> have a strong innate knowledge of magic and they're one of Harbinger's biggest go-tos when dealing with strange otherworldly phenomena, but their personalities tend to grate pretty quickly. On the other hand, later books off-handedly mention that the elves who live in Europe fit the standard High Elf stereotypes more, though it's also mentioned Tolkien <em>might</em> have exaggerated a little about them.

The greater whole of the elvish race also goes against the grain of the trope.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/CelticMythology">Celtic Mythology</a>:
<ul><li> According to one older theory, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> of Celts in Britain and Ireland were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Celtic mythology</a>, who lived underground and were stewards of nature. (Something extremely similar happened to aboriginal cultures in Africa and elsewhere and their treatment in folktales after they got invaded, BTW.) Celtic ideas eventually cross-pollinated with the Nordic version; it could be that <em>all of them</em> were prehistoric references to earlier Neanderthal, aboriginal, or Basque inhabitants that had been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreTheRealMonsters">killed off</a>. Some people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientAstronauts">have other theories</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreys">about Elves</a>...
</li><li> The above is less widely regarded than it used to be, however. Celtic faerie traditions match closely with other stories from around the world, so while there may be elements of the supposedly conquered precursors, there is definitely an animist tradition at work, as well. It helps that the Celts weren't the only culture that thought of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a> as chthonic: compare modern Icelandic beliefs about elves inhabiting rock formations, the Oreads and Lampades of Hellenic belief, and the South American Native tales of underworld spirits, amongst many, many other traditions.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurNymphsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurNymphsAreDifferent">The nymphs</a>. Despite being flanderized into benevolent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyDevils">Horny Devils</a>, in actual mythology they were very similar to what we think of as wood elves.
</li><li> The Finnish word for elf, <em>haltia</em> (used almost exclusively in literature, both indigenous and translated) is cognate to word <em>haltija</em>, meaning "proprietor" or "possessor". The original <em>haltia</em>s of Finnish mythology were proprietary or patron spirits or creatures of various places, locations, or occupations. They were considered to be semi-corporeal, very much like what Tolkien's elves would become by "fading" if they stayed in the Middle-earth instead of escaping to the Undying Lands. <br/><br/>The ancestor spirit association is also present with <em>haltia</em>. For long it was believed that the first person to set a fire in the stove of a newly built house would become its <em>haltia</em> after death, looking after and protecting its occupants. Later on these spirits became mixed with the Scandinavian <em>tomte</em>, and became invisible, gnome-like servants of the household with no history as deceased humans, similar to the house elfs of Anglo-Saxon lore.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Norse Mythology</a> is where it all started.
<ul><li> They were more magically gifted, long lived/immortal, and very beautiful. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarves</a>, in Norse the <em>dvergar</em>, were a subrace of elves, and commonly called <em>svartálfar</em> or <em>dökkálfar</em> (black/dark elves), who aren't believed to have been a separate race from dwarves. They even mated with humans to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfHumanHybrid">Half-Human Hybrids</a>. There were some things which didn't make it into modern times: they could also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">phase through walls</a>, they lived on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnotherDimension">their own plane</a> called Álfheimr, and they had facial hair.
</li><li> In earlier Norse myths, the Dvergar were entirely separate from the Álfar, having sprung from Ymir's flesh as maggots. The idea they were a subset of elves was made fairly recently as far as the myths go, when Christianity was already taking hold in Scandinavia.
</li><li> The Elves were also minor gods who held power over the lands they inhabited. Humans would hold Álfablót, where they would sacrifice animals, and sometimes slaves to the local elves for the sake of good crops. It was also possible for humans to become elves after death, like King Olaf Geirstad-Elf, and so Elves could be ancestor spirits that look after a people or household.
</li><li> Interestingly, their early depictions were less negative than usual for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, being seen as largely morally ambivalent. As society Christianized, they were seen in an increasingly negative light, up to the point that they were demons in all but name.
</li></ul></li><li> Germanic Mythology has a bit of a different take
<ul><li> While the German tribes occupying present day Germany were arguably Norse, they had their own spin on the elfs (and are probably the originators of the name). The most important part of which was the fact that they had seemingly two types of elfs: the Alben and the Alpe. Both names originated for the Latin albus meaning white but they were quite different being.
</li><li> The alp was an incubus in the traditional sense (incubo meaning "to lie upon"). While most other Norse tribes had the Mare, an always female incubus that is the source of the words for nightmare in multiple Germanic languages( nigh-mare in English, chauce-mar in French, mar-dröm in Swedish) the Germans had a few more words and creatures that caused nightmares. One of these creatures was the always male, Alp from which the German Alp-traum and of course Alp-zopf originate.(alpzoft meaning alp/elflock)
</li><li> Beyond the Apl though the Germans also had the Alb. The Alben/Elben were deceivers and more similar to hidden/fae folk around Europe than to the Scandinavian Norse elfs. One thing of note about Alben is their king Alberich. Alberich means king of the elves and in Germany was the king of all fairies. Outside Germany the name changed to Auberon for the Franks, and Oberon when the English borrowed it. Probably the most important and relevant thing to note about him was the fact that he was a dwarf.
</li><li> While the Scandinavian alfar were minor deities of normal stature whose ranks humans could join after death, the Germanic Alben/Elben seem to be more traditional fairies of a lesser more diminutive stature. Similar to how Alberich became the kings of the fairies by the middle ages, so too the continental Alben probably assimilated with other smaller fairies resulting in two opposing views of what an elf was. One, the tall, god like Norse elfe. The other, the diminutive, dwarf like elf that "birthed" the Christmas elves of the 19th century.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BurningWheel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BurningWheel">Burning Wheel</a></em>: The elves go back to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">Tolkien</a> roots, with the split between wood elves and high elves being primarily reflected in the Wilderlands vs Citadel/Etharch settings. It is not, however, that difficult to move between the settings — an elf born in the Wilderlands could easily grow up in the Citadel setting. On the whole, however, they are simply better than the other stocks (Men, Dwarves, Orcs). Their main drawback is an inability to use Sorcery, instead depending on a system of magical songs that represent their closeness to nature and the world as a whole. The game does avert most of the tropes associated with dark elves, who are described in the <em>Paths of Spite</em> supplement and are just like normal elves except the mystical Grief the normal elves suffer from has been transmuted to Spite.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chronopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chronopia">Chronopia</a></em>: The Elves are slender, haughty, and long lived, viewing themselves as the rightful rulers of the world, and have a history of slavery and backstabbing to get what they want. They segregated into four houses whose views and motives tend to vary. They are willing to ally with the other races against the Devout but without the Devout they would focus on making themselves powerful again.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CrimsonBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CrimsonBlades">Crimson Blades</a></em>: The sample setting presented, the Crimson Lands, was controlled by a once powerful race of amoral sorcerers and slavers called the Dendrelyssi, until humanity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">fought back</a>. Due to their misuse of dark magic, the world is infested with strange monstrosities and phenomena, and the Dendrelyssi are slowly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">dying out</a> from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">magical corruption</a>. The Dendrelyssi very much follow the Dark Elf archetype, with the main difference is their appearance is based on Elric of Melniboné. While their prowess with weapons and spells can be surpassed by human warriors and sorcerers, they can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">learn to use both</a>, and are unequal in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">summoning</a> demons, elementals and the undead. They are also the best healers and surgeons around, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadDoctor">"Fleshcrafter"</a> are not known for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkipTheAnesthetic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkipTheAnesthetic">bedside manners</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye">The Dark Eye</a></em>: The four main elf races are "Auelf" (meadow or floodplain elf), "Waldelf" (wood elf), "Steppenelf" (prairie elf) and "Firnelf" (ice elf). They all share a very nature-focused behavior and are naturally talented with magic — they're all fully able spellcasters on top of anything else they do. They're descended from beings that "stepped out of the Light", and all of them except for the wood elves are descendants of the old High Elven civilization that built great cities, but eventually broke apart so spectacularly that modern-day elves disdain the trappings of "civilization" (including, among much else, big cities, book-learning and the worship of gods) and instead try to live <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmonyWithNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InHarmonyWithNature">In Harmony with Nature</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DragonDice">Dragon Dice</a></em> features two types of elves — the Coral Elves, who are equivalent to High Elves living in flying coral ships, and the Lava Elves, who are equivalent to Dark Elves living in volcanic subterranean caverns.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>: The standard modern version of elves may not come directly from <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, but rather descend indirectly from it via <em>D&amp;D</em>, which unabashedly copied Tolkien's elves and their cultures. It has high elves, wood elves, dark elves, and half-elves, and inspired decades of fantasy writing. <em>D&amp;D</em>'s elves are a foot shorter than humans, except in the Forgotten Realms setting where they're about the same height.
<ul><li> The basic rules for player character races in <em>AD&amp;D2</em> established that elves and humans can interbreed, but that the offspring of half-elves could themselves only be half-elves or humans — never "true" elves again, no matter how distant the human part of their ancestry might be.
</li><li> The drow, evil elves banished underground, are the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> for modern fantasy's dark elves. They have coal-black skin and bone-white hair, live underground, are unapologetically evil, worship spiders (sometimes leading to the creation of driders, centaurine beings with spider legs and bodies and dark elf torsos), loathe surface elves, regard <em>every</em> other race with contempt, and use arranged breeding, eugenics and infanticide to weed out any drow that is "defective" or plain not handsome enough.
<ul><li> Interestingly, at one point this was not true. The elite drow leaders were usually cruel and barbaric, but most drow were semi-slaves tending towards Neutral. They could be quite helpful to the party who at that time were largely assumed to be good.
</li><li> The drow of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a> are also rather different. There are in fact entire (albeit small) communities of non-evil drow, mostly due to the presence of Eilistraee (a goddess who strives for her people to embrace a better, non self-destructive life).
</li></ul></li><li> The number of elven subraces (including aquatic elves, winged elves, and star elves, to name a few — eleven different races at least) has grown over the years. However, in the 4th Edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, the elven race is more generally divided into Elves (wood elves), Eladrin (high elf fairy folk), and Drow (dark elves), with the more specific subraces falling under one of those categories.
</li><li> Pre-4th Edition <em>D&amp;D</em> splits the high elf archetype into two separate subraces: the noble but friendly high elves, who have a bit of wood elf flavor as well, and the regal yet arrogant and isolationist gray elves. Both names are taken from Tolkien, though their descriptions were switched around a bit. The wood elf archetype was also split into the wood elves proper (civilized but rustic, and stronger than the average human) and the wild elves (perilous savages).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>: The Elves come in three cultures: the corporate ones, who are generally considered to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">all-around backstabbing scum</a> with a minor trade war going on between two of the houses; the arcane ones, who are ruled by the animated bodies of their dead ancestors; and the badass <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Proud Warrior Race Guy</a> elves, who may not be ethically better than you, but will gladly split you in half with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyCoolWeapon">double-bladed scimitar</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves">if you point this out</a>.
<ul><li> Interestingly, half-elves have become an established minority who are more often born to two half-elf parents than a mixed-race couple. There are even half-elf noble families. This is partly due to an early attempt by shifty elves to capitalize on the short human lifespan by marrying aristocratic humans and outliving them to inherit their estates. At this point the two races were new to each other and the elves had no idea they could actually cross-breed with the humans. Embarrassed by their children, the elves mostly ran for it. But as these first generation half-elves were usually born as heirs to noble houses, they did not end up being socially-ostracized by humans (just the opposite). Then when the Dragonmark of Storm appeared among the half-elves it was taken as a sign that they were destined to be a "race" unto themselves. An interesting aversion in <em>Eberron</em> is that <em>orcs</em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloserToEarth">Closer to Earth</a> than elves, having a strong tradition of druids who saved the world from an extraplanar invasion.
</li><li> <em>Eberron</em>'s half-elves often believe themselves to be better than both elves and humans, to the point where the <em>Player's Guide to Eberron</em> quotes an excerpt from a play that appears to entirely be about half-elves and urban elves engaging in ridiculously overstated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">Cultural Posturing</a>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Cullaris:</strong> Tell me, what virtue do we not possess? <br/><strong>Mahlla:</strong> Humility? <br/><strong>Cullaris:</strong> Yes, perhaps.
</div></li><li> The Drow of <em>Eberron</em> are jungle-dwelling tribes that hate giants and are associated with scorpions instead of spiders, and whether they're evil or neutral varies from tribe to tribe. <em>Individual</em> Drow can be of any alignment, since <em>Eberron</em> is built on explicitly disavowing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> trope. They descend from those elves who chose not to abandon their homelands on the jungle continent of Xen'drik, and consequently consider themselves to be the true inheritors of the old elven civilization and the "regular" elves to be cowardly deserters.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Spelljammer">Spelljammer</a></em> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Space Elves</a> — the motley collection of elves hailing from every world with an elven population. Most of which became so obnoxiously haughty that next to <em>these</em> groundling elves began to look nice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a></em>: Elves mostly fall under the Wood Elf variant, although they make a lot more use of magic, owing to the Basic/Expert/etc system having given <em>all</em> elves spellcasting ability. The dark elf trope is partially averted, in that the subterranean shadow elves aren't black-skinned or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>, and are actually pretty naive if you get to know them. Too bad they're pissed at the surface elves for not telling them that the planet had recovered from a nuclear war thousands of years ago, never mind how the surface elves had no idea the shadow elves were still down there. Several elven populations on Mystara are actually well-integrated with their non-elven neighbors, particularly in Graakhalia (elves and <em>gnolls</em> as buds!) and on the Savage Coast.
<ul><li> Under the Basic/Expert/etc. system, half-elves don't exist on Mystara. Human/elf pairs aren't very fertile, and their descendants are either humans or elves, depending on which parent is male and which is female. Oddly, Mystaran elves and <em>ogres</em> have proven genetically compatible, giving rise to a hybrid race called the N'djatwa from two once-warring civilizations. Physically, they get the best of both worlds, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatuesqueStunner">large but attractive</a> and highly intelligent. Culturally... they're basically a blend of the worst aspects, and thusly they're slavers who regard other races as both servants and fodder.
</li><li> The "there are no human/elf half-elves" thing was retconned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Dragon">Dragon</a></em> #178, where the land of Eusdria is home to an ever-increasing population of half-elves. They were created through the divine meddling by the Immortals Fredar and Fredara (better known to other lands as Frey and Freya), who created them in an effort to promote and increase homogeneity in the land that worshipped them. These half-elves are mostly true-breeding—half-elf plus anything else has a 65% chance of a new half-elf child—and mechanically they work like humans who trade a -5% penalty to EXP for access to elvin infravision and having a Halfling lifespan.
</li></ul></li><li> Under the original <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> rules, "Elf", "Dwarf" and "Halfling" races had significant class restrictions. Elves could choose once a day whether to be a fighter or a magic user, and were subject to the weapon and armor restrictions of whatever class they chose — elves who were in fighter mode could use any weapon, wear any armor and use any shield, but if they were in magic-user mode, they couldn't use any armor (unless it was magical armor, which human magic-users could not use) and were limited to the weapons of a magic user.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em> has High Elves in Darkon and Sithicus. The latter are more snobbish than the former, having a country of their own; the fact that the Land of Mists has only existed for ~400 years, and Sithicus for a fraction of that, means that their claims of "ancient heritage" tend to fall flat.
</li><li> Elven lifespan seems to have been shrinking monotonically with edition, from 900-1500 years (depending on variety) in the old days to 200-300 in 4e.
</li><li> LeShay are described as being to elves what elves are to men. They are a race of epic, immortal superbeings with spell-like abilities and hit-dice up the wazoo, can make you their best friend just by looking at you (hard to resist gaze attack) and can summon twin +10 Keen Brilliant Energy Bastard Swords they can wield without penalty (for those not in the know, they have a very high chance of scoring a critical hit, can ignore most kinds of armor, have ridiculous to hit and damage bonuses, and you can't kill them and take them because they are made of the elves' personal energy). They supposedly survived the death of the last universe.
</li><li> 4th edition <em>D&amp;D</em>, as personified by its default <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NentirVale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NentirVale">Nentir Vale</a></em> setting, divides elf into an eladrin/elf/drow triad:
<ul><li> Eladrin are the root stock from which elves and drow sprung, but they both diverged after a violent, centuries-long civil war that has left the eladrin a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">Vestigial Empire</a> in the Feywild, huddling in heavily-fortified cities that are under near-constant siege. Not just by drow, but also by the formorians, a race of evil fey <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGiantsAreBigger">giants</a> who are horrifically ugly, insane, incredibly <em>smart</em>, adept with magic and possessed of various kinds of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeams">Eye Beams</a>. The setting emphasizes how much of their old homes the eladrin have lost, and how unlikely they are to get it back, especially with all of the fey monsters they have to battle on the side... like a species of hive-minded carnivorous beetles that specializes in <em>eating eladrin alive</em>, so it can <strong>wear their skin as a disguise to get more prey</strong>.
</li><li> Elves, meanwhile, are deserters, cowards and runaways from the civil war who fled to the mortal world instead, and have since degenerated, losing a notable amount of their fey powers — eladrin can teleport more or less at will, elves just run a little quicker than humans, and elves live a century less than eladrin do.
</li><li> Drow, meanwhile, are... basically still drow. They're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> underground-living demon-worshiping backstabbing lunatics.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in the alternative class rules from the canon product <em>D&amp;D Cyclopedia</em> (the compilation of the Basic, Expert, Companion and Master set). Normally in the Basic system era, Elves and other demi-humans as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BareFistedMonk">Mystics</a> get hosed as they can only reach limited levels (in the Elf's case it's Level 10) while the other classes can go up to Level 36. This was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyLowLevelCap">"balance"</a> the demi-humans' and the Mystic's abilities (like the Elf's combining Fighter and Mage abilities at once). With the alternate rules — everyone can reach Level 36. The Elf has all the Fighter abilities (but their fighting skill is now equivalent to a Cleric's) and they have access to all the Mage spells, including the Level 9 ones like Wish.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>: When first introduced in this setting, eladrin weren't elves but instead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">angel equivalents who look like elves</a>, with a vaguely Celtic theme and each eladrin subspecies being able to shapeshift into an "energy form" — usually a living mass of fire, but the one aquatic species could become a dolphin-shaped mass of golden water and another species could become a whirling mass of snow and ice. 4th edition reinvented them as the most "human" of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, portraying them as the dominant civilized race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandOfFaerie">the Feywild</a>. In 5th edition, they were brought back with that same interpretation, although now redesigned so that they physically and mentally shift through a set of season-themed subraces.
</li><li> In <em>D&amp;D</em> 5th edition, the core elven subraces in the Player's Handbook are High Elf, Wood Elf and Dark Elf. A later sourcebook, <em>Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes</em>, adds the Aquatic Elf, the Eladrin, and the Shadar-kai (a cursed race of shadowy elves from the Hades-esque Shadowfell).
</li><li> <em>Arkadia</em>, a 3rd party setting for <em>D&amp;D</em> 5e, uses High, Wood and Dark Elves, but reinvents them for its Heroic Bronze Age Fantasy style. Scyllaean Elves, the high elf equivalents, are refugees from the setting's equivalent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. Oreyan Elves are basically Bronze Age wood elves, but have an "Amazonian" culture, where women are the primary hunters and warriors. Finally, the dark elf analogs, the Nyssian Elves, have an Egyptian motif, living in buried cities concealed beneath stone pyramids in a cursed desert, practicing necromancy in homage to the undead titan they worship and being led by a cabal of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">lich-pharaohs</a>. Seeing sunlight is the deepest taboo possible, and any Nyssian Elf who sees the light of day is forever after exiled from their former home.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fellowship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Fellowship">Fellowship</a></em>: The elves are known for being graceful and long-lived, and for standing out. Their core stat is Grace, and they can tap into innate magical powers called "elder arts" and can walk safely on precarious surfaces, or even run up sheer surfaces for short distances. The elf variants available include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurFairiesAreDifferent">Faeries</a> (small <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingedHumanoid">Winged Humanoids</a> who can fly, and can briefly share the power of flight with others), Merfolk (who can breathe underwater, and can use their elder arts practically indefinitely as long as they're near a body of water), Star Elves (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleGreenMen">otherworldly beings from beyond the stars</a> with high-tech "gizmos"), and Wood Elves (forest-dwelling elves who are great at travelling through woodlands stealthily).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageKnight">Mage Knight</a></em>, a now-defunct miniatures game, has the standard Three as well, played fairly straight. The High Elves are a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templars</a>, the Wood Elves share power with a consortium of Centaurs and other woodland critters, and the Dark Elves are vampires-in-training lumped in with the "undead faction".

The oldest elves are all brilliant but seem to have no real ambition. In this setting, "dark elves" are an aggressively paranoid cult within elf society that wants to magically expel all non-elven life from Yrth; the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">Banestorm</a> was the fault of a group of dark elf mages trying to banish all the orcs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">They ''summoned'' humanity and a bunch of other races instead.</a>

Regular Elves have the Elite rule across the board, letting them reroll one attack (in first edition) or all 1's on the attack roll (in second); Twilight Kin have Vicious instead, which does the same thing but for damage rolls instead, meaning they're <em>roughly</em> equal, with Elite mainly being an advantage for war machines.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>:
<ul><li> Elves are much like their <em>D&amp;D</em> counterparts, with the usual isolationist forest kingdom, long lives, largely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> natures and detached attitudes from the rest of the world, with the added change of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonochromaticEyes">Monochromatic Eyes</a> that are almost all iris/pupil. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Earthfall</a>, they mostly avoided the devastation by fleeing to Castrovel, the setting's equivalent of the planet Venus. Those who stayed behind were forced underground and eventually became the drow. As it turns out, elves who become consumed by hatred and/or evil will turn <em>into</em> drow. Unlike the <em>D&amp;D</em> kind, who worship Lolth almost exclusively, <em>Pathfinder</em> are demon-worshipers who do not tolerate the worship of true deities (meta-wise, this is due to Lolth being <em>D&amp;D</em> copyright and thus not usable by <em>Pathfinder</em>).
</li><li> The elves are further divided into a number of distinct cultures and ethnic groups:
<ul><li> The Aiudeen are the setting's "default" elves, descending from the ones who fled Golarion through the <em>aiudara</em> gates and later came back. Due to this, they are also called the Returners.
</li><li> The Spiresworn are an offshoot of the Aiudeen who secluded themselves in the Mordant Spire — a tower that grew from the corpse of a dead goddess — shortly after returning to Golarion, and now guard the secrets of lost Azlant and wage a secret war against the aboleths.
</li><li> The Ilverani, also called the Snowcaster elves, are a reclusive people with ice-white skin and hair, whose ancestors sought refuge in the far north of the world, and who still lead harsh lives among the snowy wilds of the Crown of the World.

Due to the elves' long lifespans and slow growing cycles, these elves inevitably see several generations of their caretakers, friends, siblings and rivals grow, age and die before they even reach adulthood, often harming their ability to form meaningful connections later in life. They also end up having trouble connecting to the slow-paced, long-term views and lifestyles of other elves, preventing them from truly fitting in either world, and are often referred to as the Forlorn as a result.
</li><li> Half-elves are also common, and can have different traits depending on which kind of elf they descend from. Most half-elves are half-human, but in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Starfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Starfinder">Starfinder</a></em> it's more common for them to be half-ryphorian (ryphorians being the main humanoid natives of Triaxus, another planet in Golarion and Castrovel's solar system). They mostly live within elven or human societies, but can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBreedingHybrid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueBreedingHybrid">breed true with one another</a> and at least one town, the port of Erages in the elven homeland of Kyonin, is majority half-elf.
</li><li> Wood giants are essentially the giants' version of elves — they live in hidden villages within ancient forests, revere and protect nature, and are distinguished from other giants by their long pointed ears.

The elves here are around the same height as humans, and they commonly practice tattooing, regardless of race. The common elven races on Ghelspad, the primary continent, are wood elves, who are close to standard, and the dark elves (or drendali), who avert the usual depiction by tending towards neutrality rather than evil, only being called "dark" because they live underground. Half-elves in Ghelspad are rare — they're playable, but they're not a core PC race.

<ul><li> They came into being around 2011 AD, when a noticeable percentage of human mothers began, apparently at random, to give birth to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">dwarf</a> and elf babies. Dwarf/elf and either/human couples give birth to only dwarf, elf or human babies; no half-races exist. Elf/elf couples breed true so long as there's enough available magic; when magic dips, they give birth to apparently human children. Thousands of years later, when magic rises again, their otherwise-human descendants give birth to elf babies. There's also a random genetic quirk that can make an elf ageless rather than the normal two-hundred plus lifespan. By 2050 AD, a handful of conspiracy-loving Immortal Elves who survived since the previous cycle of magic have organized many of their born-since-magic-returned-in-2011 brethren into full-fledged not-so-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">Hidden Elf Nations</a>. Generally speaking, the elves who live in normal human society know nothing about Immortal bloodlines or previous ages of magic and are frankly annoyed that the elf-centric countries exist, because it's fuel for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a>.
</li><li> As with all other metatypes, a number of distinctive variants have emerged from the main elf stock as a result of genetic variance and secondary awakening events. These are the nocturnae, also called dark elves and self-referred to as Night Ones, a European strain marked by a mild sunlight allergy, a resulting nocturnal lifestyle and short fur that would be indistinguishable from skin if not for its blue, black and violet shades; dryads, shorter and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale">Always Female</a> elves with an allergy to pollution; wakyambi, rare and extremely tall African elves with dark skin and rounded ears; and xapiri thëpë, a reclusive tribal people from South America with photosynthetic patches of chlorophyll-rich skin.

However, Ariane, Mandalans, Mirin, Muses, Phantasians, and Thaecians can all easily be called elves with the serial number filled off.

Then, the Tormenta invaded her own divine realm, demoting her to a minor goddess. To make matters worse, she was so terrified that she accepted protection from the minotaur god of power, Tauron — a god that demands the weak to serve him. So the elven goddess is but a sex slave, and the elves have no nation, no goddess, no pride and no love from the setting's creators. Oh, and most half-elves were born from rape in the war.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UresiaGraveOfHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UresiaGraveOfHeaven">Uresia Grave Of Heaven</a></em>: The author stated that every elven community was in fact a separate subrace — so you did not only had High Elves, you had Mountain High Elves, City High Elves, Wood High Elves...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> has fairly standard High, Dark, and Wood Elves (there were also Sea Elves, but they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into just being the High Elves' more nautically-oriented factions). The High Elf army book goes on and on about how the High Elves are the greatest wizards, warriors, etc. etc. etc. in the world. High Elves, Dark Elves and Wood Elves are also, strictly speaking, the names humans and dwarfs use for them — the elves refer to themselves as Asur, Druchii and Asrai, respectively. They also all look more or less the same — their distinctions are by and large purely cultural.
<ul><li> The High Elves of Ulthuan (Atlantis, essentially) are notable for the structure and tone of their military, which tends to focus a lot on combined arms. And also on really, really big <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">swords</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAxeToGrind">axes</a>, which aren't usually considered classical Elf weapons, and on heavily armored cavalry. But then, they wield their six-foot-long two-handed swords <em>gracefully</em>. Also, instead of the usual stereotypical rangers, they instead have Shadow Warriors, which are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninjas</a> really (down to the outfits).
<ul><li> The High Elves also have an unusual focus on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastOfBattle">war beasts</a>, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DragonRider">dragons ridden into battle by Elven lords</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">giant eagles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhoenix">fiery and icy phoenixes</a> and giant white lions that can pull chariots or be ridden into battle. There are also the White Lions of Chrace, a unit of axe-wielding elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NemeanSkinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NemeanSkinning">wearing lion pelts that they got from hunting down one of these lions and killing it personally</a>. Among other things, <em>Warhammer</em> elves should be commended for combining elven grace with being very badass.
</li><li> They are however quite typical examples of this trope in terms of their immense haughtiness, arrogance and firm belief in their cultural, magical and ethical superiority over everybody else, and for a long, bitter enmity with the Dwarfs that could have been easily avoided (alongside a lot of bloodshed) had the two peoples been less arrogant and proud.
</li><li> The High Elves of Avelorn, one of the ten realms of Ulthuan and ruled by the high priestess of the Elven mother goddess, blur the line between high elves and wood elves; while culturally High Elven, they're also forest-dwelling nature-lovers, on good terms with the forest spirits that share their forested realm and noted to be very close kin of the Wood Elves proper.
</li></ul></li><li> The Wood Elves are descended from High Elven colonists who declined their King's request to return to Ulthuan and instead bunkered down in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods">The Lost Woods</a> of Athel Loren, are quite different from the standard Elf; they can be very cruel and capricious and generally act more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, especially their king Orion and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildHunt">Wild Hunt</a>. They're also allied with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants">Treemen</a> who share their forests, and with giant, intelligent hawks and eagles that they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseOfADifferentColor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseOfADifferentColor">ride into battle</a>. They also tend to act as a moral and magical middle ground between their High and Dark cousins. There is a second population of wood elves, the Eonir of Laurelorn Forest within the borders of the Empire, likewise descended from recalcitrant colonists but otherwise largely separate. As Laurelorn is a fairly "normal" magical forest instead of Athel Loren's borderline spirit world, the Eonir are much less fey than their Asrai cousins and somewhat less isolationist, engaging in trade and diplomacy with the Empire and even allowing villages to be funded within parts of their land — albeit only after a strict vetting process, granted.
</li><li> The Dark Elves are the descendents of a faction of Chaos-worshipping High Elves who rebelled against the rest of their kind after their ruler, Malekith, attempted to crown himself king after killing his predecessor (the fact that becoming the High Elven king requires the chief elven god's say-so, and that said god was very unimpressed with Malekith's power grab, is a big part of why this coup didn't work). They were exiled from Ulthuan and settled in Naggaroth, a frozen and monster-haunted waste located where North America would be, and established a cruel civilization focused on the worship of the elven gods of war and murder, death, hedonism and the savage hunt. They're bitter enemies with the High Elves, and the two groups are constantly at war. They're feared the world over as terrifying raiders, corsairs and slavers, and have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithDinosaurs">velociraptor-mounted heavy cavalry</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyRoleplay">Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</a></em>, elves have the highest ability score modifiers (two positive, no negative), a base movement of 5 (as fast as your average horse), their career list lacks many of the sucky human ones like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">the peasant</a>, and if you want to be a wizard you don't have to pay tuition. Of course, these fat bonuses come at the cost of one <em>massive</em> drawback: <em>you're an elf and you have to play like one</em>, in a setting where everyone is extremely racist and hostile to them and will try to take an axe or a pitchfork or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">a torch</a> to them. To give you an idea of just how hated elves are in this setting, a poor sap who got on the wrong side of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoanShark">Loan Shark</a> named Bruno Ballcrusher now lives in a cell with a child molester, a serial rapist and an elf... and talks about his predicament like being with the elf is the worst part.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>: The Eldar are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvesInSpace">Elves In Space</a>! to a "T", as the term Eldar was used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> to describe a subset of elves. Much like other denizens of the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> universe (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orks</a>, the now-defunct Squats, Necrons), they are based on counterparts from the <em>Warhammer Fantasy</em> universe. Heirs to one of the oldest civilizations in existence, their hedonism and magical power created a Chaos God that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">almost destroyed their civilization</a> and has plague the galaxy since. They even have two cousin factions: the Dark Eldar (who are dark elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledInSpace">Recycled In Space</a> with the dark aspect turned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>) and the Exodites (who are more or less planetary wood elves who prefer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">isolation</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">pastoral environments</a>).
<ul><li> The Eldar, much like everyone else in the setting, are morally grey at their best and actively evil at their worst, and are fully willing to instigate wars (from behind the scenes) in which billions of humans can die to save a few thousand Eldar. The Second and Third Armageddon Wars are a perfect example of this, an Eldar farseer engineered the rise of an Ork Warboss who went on to start the two wars which claimed billions of human and ork lives because he had foreseen that if he did not then ten thousand Eldar would die. He later looked back on the act and stated that it was completely worth it. The "up for debate" part, however, is because this isn't particularly out of the ordinary for <em>any</em> of the factions in 40k. Doubtless the Imperium of Man would do the exact same thing if the roles were reversed, to say nothing for the unquestionably more evil sides. Other Craftworlds have been rather more cooperative when confronting a greater threat, although they will not hesitate to act if they feel threatened in any way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperiorSpecies">Eldar physiology is generally superior to that of your average human</a>. In keeping with stereotypical elfin attributes, Eldar are extremely nimble and have faster reflexes than almost anyone else; even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Space Marines</a> can barely keep up with most of them in reaction speeds, let alone trained Aspect Warriors. Whereas psykers are comparatively rare among other races, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">every single Eldar possesses some degree of psychic power and the race as a whole is host to some of the most powerful psykers in the galaxy</a>. Even after Slaanesh started to steal their souls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyOfImmortals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyOfImmortals">they can still easily live for thousands of years</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">without any signs of aging</a>, though this is offset by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalProcreationClause">a low birth rate</a> that further exacerbates their constantly declining population. And then there's the fact that no matter how good you are at something, be you a musician or a warrior, a painter or a pilot, any Eldar from that path has likely done it for far longer than you, has practiced it more than you and <em>will</em> be better than you at it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Whether or not they could do anything else is another question entirely</a>.
</li><li> Biologically, however, the Eldar are still aliens and share little internal anatomy with humans. Their blood crystallizes instead of scabbing, their teeth are direct outgrowths of the jawbones, they have a complex system of hollow fibers instead of marrow and their organs do not appear to have any clear analogues with those of humans, although they do seem to have free-floating lymph nodes.
</li><li> In general, Craftworld Eldar don't act too much like standard fantasy elves. Rather than being loose and free-spirited, they live highly disciplined and regimented lifestyles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem">as dictated by the path they have currently chosen</a>. Not that this is without good reason, since we've <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeSpaceWedgie">seen</a> what happens when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">they</a> <em>are</em> loose and free-spirited. While all the Craftworld Eldar are more or less analogous to high elves, each of the main Craftworlds embody different parts of the stereotype and often blow them out of proportion in the process. Biel-Tan for example, is the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPoet">heavily militarized</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">xenophobic</a> while Ulthwe is full of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">psykers</a>. Other major Craftworlds include Iyanden (once considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShiningCity">the greatest of all surviving Craftworlds</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">is now in decline</a>), Alaitoc (which produces a lot of the societal outcasts known as Rangers due to its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">higly regimented lifestyle</a>) and finally, Saim-Hann (whose warriors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">ride around on jetbikes</a> and settle matters of honour among themselves through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">non-lethal duels</a>). While Exodites are in some respects similar to both Alaitoc and Saim-Hann, they are generally more analogous to stereotypical wood elves in that they choose to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">reject most forms of technology</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">live in harmony with the planet they settle on</a>.
</li><li> The Dark Eldar are a race that make drow look like saints — their home city of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Comorragh</a> is less Valinor and more <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Hellraiser">Hellraiser</a></em>.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfWonders3">Age of Wonders 3</a></em>, however, the Wood Elves and Dark Elves reunified and rechristened as High Elves, acquiring both of the races' traits. Meanwhile, the Archons disappeared and the dead begin rising as the Archon Revenants.

However, facing the vast expansion in the power of the humans following their industrial revolution, they have either retreated into their treetop towns or integrated into Human urban society. Since they consider themselves the oldest race in the world, some are rather annoyed at fossil finds that suggest Humans evolved first and that the Elves branched off from them later due to the influence of magic. Half-Elves are also a playable race. Unlike most depictions, they're basically liked and admired by everybody (except Half-Orcs) as they're seen as lacking typical elvish arrogance.

<ul><li> Desert Elves are <em>Armageddon</em>'s take on Wood Elves. Where humans reign in Zalanthas' city-states, elves are the primary force in the wastes, their physiques and fiercely tribal ways allowing them to survive better than other races do. Due to Zalanthas' desert nature, its elves aren't bound to forest regions at all, neither are they more 'in tune with nature' than other people are. Despite that, they thrive in their wide open environment, and tend to be fiercely distrustful of any and all humans, as well as elves foreign to them.
</li><li> City Elves don't apply to this trope very well at all. Humans rule in the cities they live in, and elves tend to be excluded from service in the militia, as well as being restricted from cushy jobs with wealthy nobles or merchant houses. Due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">the societal exclusion,</a> their fondness for thieving, and the xenophobia of anyone in Zalanthas, elves have developed a reputation for smuggling, thievery, and con artistry.

The only one keeping them in check was Mythal, who was not only the most benevolent but arguably the most powerful of the Evanuris as well, and she would often use her stabilizing influence to keep things from getting out of hand. This all changed when Mythal was murdered by the others, and one of her closest friends, both to punish the Evanuris and to prevent them from destroying the world in their greed for power, sealed the Evanuris away in the Fade and separated it from the waking world. Since the Elvhen Empire was literally built both in the Fade and the Waking World, the separation of the two had disastrous consequences, and the empire subsequently crumbled, both literally and figuratively</span>.

<ul><li> The Altmer, or High Elves, hail from the Summerset Isles in the southwest of Tamriel. They are tall with golden skin and lean frames, and are the primary descendants of the Aldmer, the first race of Mer. As such, determining when Aldmer history ended and where Altmer history began is nigh impossible. Though non-Altmer scholars are loathe to admit, the truth is that Tamriel <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">owes much of its art, science, philosophy, language and religion</a> to the Altmer, who are also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">most magically-gifted of all races</a>. However, they are often viewed as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing">haughty and snobbish</a>, looking down on the other races of Mer as "degenerates" and believing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">the races of Men to be even worse</a>. For centuries, they led a mighty empire known as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a>. In the late 2nd Era, their empire was crushed in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Tiber Septim</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Numidium</a>, forcing them to join an Empire of Men by conquest for the first time in history. During the reign of the Septim Empire, they quietly bode their time and rebuilt their shattered nation. When the Septim Dynasty ended as a result of the Oblivion Crisis, the Dominion rose once again, this time led by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a> of the Aldmeri Dominion.
</li><li> The Ayleids, or Wild Elves, of Cyrodiil were close relatives of the Altmer. The broke away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Aedra-worshiping</a> leadership of the Summerset Isles to found their own kingdom in which they could worship other entities, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">primarily the Daedra</a>. This led their mighty nation down <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">dark paths</a>, which included the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveryIsASpecialKindOfEvil">enslavement</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">vile torture</a> of the Nedes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Precursors</a> to most of the later races of Men. When these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveLiberation">slaves rose up</a> in the Alessian Revolt in the 1st Era, the Ayleid kingdom was devastated. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHeroicOrc">A few Ayleid lords who sided with the revolting slaves</a> were permitted to keep their lands, but about a century later, even they were decimated when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">rabidly anti-elven religious doctrine</a> took over the Alessian Empire. What few Ayleids remained mixed into the other races of Mer, while their cultural identity, relics, and writings were destroyed wherever they could be found. The Ayleids are now considered extinct as a unique race, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacialRemnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RacialRemnant">unconfirmed sightings</a> in the remote wilderness areas of Tamriel continued to occur into the 3rd Era. Like the Altmer, they had tall but lean frames with elongated skulls and angular facial features. They had a grayish skin tone darker than that of the Altmer, but still much lighter than that of the Dunmer.
</li><li> The Bosmer, or Wood Elves, of Valenwood are the shortest race in Tamriel and possess darker reddish/brown skin than their Altmeri cousins. They are nimble and quick as a race, making for excellent scouts, thieves, and hunters. The Bosmer are considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcherArchetype">the finest archers</a> in all Tamriel, with it even being said that they were inventors of the bow. They are descended from elven ancestors who "took mannish wives", consequently being human/elven hybrids who strongly favor their elven side. Their ancestors rejected the formal traditions of Aldmeri culture, splitting off to live simple lives more in tune with nature. They struck an agreement with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Y'ffre, the Forest God of Valenwood and the first et'Ada to transform into the Ehlnofey</a>, known as the Green Pact; in exchange for Y'ffre's patronage, they have sworn never to harm any plantlife in Valenwood (though they can import timber from other regions of Tamriel when necessary), and must live on an almost exclusively carnivorous diet (with a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">loopholes</a>. They have been assimilated or subjugated by every incarnation of the Aldmeri Dominion, in which they are treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves">second-class citizens (at best)</a> to the Altmer. They are led by the "Silvenar", who is a literal representation of the Bosmer people, changing in both body and mind to match the current state of the Bosmeri people.
</li><li> The Dunmer, or Dark Elves, of Morrowind were originally the Chimer, close relatives of the Altmer with pale gold skin, but were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMigration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMigration">led by the prophet Veloth to become the Velothi people</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">worship their ancestors and Daedra</a> rather than the Divines. They were later unified under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Nerevar</a> to create the nation of Resdaynia and become known as the Resdayn people. Early in the First Era, their alliance with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreDifferent">Dwemer</a> (originally formed to defeat the invading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>) fell apart when the Chimer learned that the Dwemer had found the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Heart of Lorkhan</a> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodIsDead">dead creator god</a>) and were planning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">to tap into it's power</a>. Seeing this as blasphemy toward their gods (the Daedra), the Chimer attacked the Dwemer stronghold at Red Mountain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRashomon">Exactly what happened next is recounted differently by all those involved</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">the Dwemer vanished</a>, three of Nerevar's closest allies (as well as a former ally turned enemy) became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">demi-gods</a>, Nerevar died, and the Chimer became ash-skinned with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedEyesTakeWarning">glowing red eyes</a>, and Azura (one of the Daedra they worshiped) told them that it was their fault (or Vivec's fault). Thusly, they became the Dunmer people. Most rallied around the new demi-gods, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">the Tribunal (Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil)</a>. Several tribes clung to the old ways in the ashy barrens of Vvardenfell and became known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleSavage">the Ashlanders</a>. For 4000 years, this was the way of life for the Dunmer. When Tiber Septim came to conquer Morrowind, Vivec allowed Morrowind to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoluntaryVassal">Voluntary Vassal</a> and traded to the Emperor the (Dwemer-crafted, Dunmer-seized) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Numidium</a> in exchange for special privileges (such as continuing to allow slavery). After the Oblivion Crisis, in a series of events known as the "Red Year", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Ministry of Truth crashed down</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsVolcano">Red Mountain erupted</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Argonians</a>, a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a> of the Dunmer, then came to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">conquer what was left</a> of South Morrowind. Now, the Dunmer people are scattered, with many of them settling in Solstheim and Skyrim. The Dunmer possess both strong physiques and keen intellects, which make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">highly adaptable and equally skilled as warriors, sorcerers, or rogues</a>, but Dunmer tend to be grim, aloof and disdainful of other races.

Unlike the other races of Mer, there is no known record of their disassociation with the Aldmer, which is believed to have happened in very early Tamriellic history. They were an industrious, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">highly intelligent</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">extremely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">technologically</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAdvancedAlien">advanced</a> people, but were also known to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusivePrecursors">cruel, arrogant, and dogmatic</a>. Contemporary accounts describe them as "unfathomable" and "unknowable", with truly alien belief systems unlike anyone else in Tamriel. While they mostly wanted to be left alone, they came into conflict with every other race that encountered them, usually over religious differences (the Dwemer were known to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Naytheist">extreme atheists</a>, refuting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatEarthAtheist">any known "divine" beings were truly "gods" worth worshiping</a>). The entire race <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">mysteriously vanished</a> during the 1st Era, around the time of the Battle of Red Mountain. Only the ruins of their civilization remain, though these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">still protected by deadly traps</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">mechanical guardians</a>, making them very dangerous places to visit. Their male fashion also appears to have included <em>glorious</em> beards.
</li><li> The Falmer, or Snow Elves, had a Merethic Era empire which spanned throughout Skyrim and Solstheim, and who once had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">a civilization rivaling that of the Altmer</a>. Unlike the other races of Mer elsewhere in Tamriel, they lived peacefully along side the races of Men for at least several centuries. However, an event known as the "Night of Tears" saw them slaughter and burn the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Atmoran/Nord</a> city of Saarthal. In revenge, Ysgramor recruited an army of 500 Atmorans and invaded Skyrim, nearly driving the Falmer to extinction. The survivors were taken in by their Dwemeri cousins, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnslavedElves">enslaved</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">mutated</a> them into blind, debased, and feral creatures <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMorlocks">little better than Goblins</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth">dwell underground</a>. A small population of unmutated Snow Elves managed to survive at a remote chantry in Skyrim, but by the 4th Era, only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind">one unmuted (or otherwise corrupted) Snow Elve yet lives</a>. Physically, the pre-mutation Falmer resembled the Altmer, being tall with lean frames, angular facial features, and elongated skulls. However, they had pale white skin and hair. Following the mutation, the Falmer appear as hunched-over grayish-skinned humanoids without noses (instead having long nostril slits) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyelessFace">skin having grown over their blind eyes</a>.
</li><li> The Left-Handed Elves, or Sinistral Mer, were the Elven inhabitants of Yokuda, a continent far to the wast of Tamriel. They fought a devastating war against the Yokudans (ancestors of the Redguards) that rendered them extinct. Due to being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unperson">Unpersoned</a> by the Redguards, the only unique trait still known about them is that their entire race was left-handed.
</li><li> The Maormer, or Sea Elves, hail from Pyandonea, a jungle continent to the south of Tamriel. Legend holds that they split off from the Aldmer before the Aldmer even left Aldmeris, with the Maormer banished from and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantGoHomeAgain">forbidden to return</a> to Aldmeris after they attempted a rebellion. There is said to be a literal veil of mist that they cannot penetrate surrounding their former home. They have blank eyes and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChameleonCamouflage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChameleonCamouflage">chameleon-like skin</a>, can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">tame sea serpents</a>, and are lead by an undying wizard named Orgnum. Throughout the 1st and 2nd Eras, they raided the coastal towns of their ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, the Altmer.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">Orsimer</a>, Orcs or Pariah Elves, hail from the Wrothgarian and Dragontail mountains on the border of High Rock and Hammerfell. The first Orcs were created when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Prince</a> Boethiah devoured and later excreted the Aldmeri spirit Trinimac. Trinimac's remains became the Daedric Prince Malacath, while his Aldmeri followers were transformed into the Orcs. Malacath is the central figure and patron deity in Orcish religion. Most outsiders see Orcs as savages; that their lives are short and filled with violence and misery. Several times, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingForAHomeland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FightingForAHomeland">they've attempted to form their own city/state</a>, Orsinium, literally "Orc Town". However, Orsinium has been razed and rebuilt several times — having been razed once again in the 4th Era — leaving many Orcs to eke out a living in destitute, dilapidated "strongholds" on the edges of society. They possess strong, muscular builds and green skin. They are known for their ferocity and courage in battle, as well as their skill as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith">armorers and smiths</a> (especially with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyMetals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyMetals">rare metal Orichalcum</a>), making them some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneWall">the finest heavy infantry</a> on all of Nirn.
</li><li> The Bretons, while technically a human population, are essentially Mannish counterparts to the Bosmer, descending from human/elven pairings in the distant past but nowadays being far more Man than Mer. Their ancestry, however, makes modern-day Bretons much more magically gifted than other human groups.

She also sells the game's best accessories (...which are also the most expensive).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/EndlessLegend">Endless Legend</a></em>: The Wild Walkers are close to wood elves; prior to the start of the game, they lived in the forests, practiced the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyeSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalEyeSpy">sharing</a>", and made heavy use of bows. On the other hand, their males have impressive beards and they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">twi'lek</a>-esque protrusions on their head above their ears. Their leader realized their world is dying from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter">increasingly lengthy and brutal winters</a>, and began to expand out of the forests, turning the pastoral civilization into a nation of townsbuilders of staggering industrial capacity. They still remain close to their spiritual origins, and utilize golems, physical incarnations of the power of the forest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> plays this trope straight and helped fortify it for more modern standards when the game was released in 1999. The Elven word for "Elf" is "Dal", and the species are broken into various types found all across Norrath:
<ul><li> Feir'Dal: Wood Elves: Descendants of the original elven race created by the God of Nature, Tunare. They live in the treetop city of Kelethin in the Greater Faydark forest. Naturally (no pun intended), they are more in tune with nature, with a society consisting mainly of Druids, Rangers, Rogues (who work for the city itself,) Bards, and Warriors. They have a very friendly position towards outsiders, and get along well with Humans. They stand 5 feet tall and have a tan complexion and hair colors running the normal human gambit between black, brown, blond, and red. They typically live to be about 650-700 years old.
</li><li> Koada'Dal: High Elves: Cousins to the Wood Elves, the High Elves live in the nearby city of Felwithe (anagram for White Elf) in the Greater Faydark forest. They stand a foot taller than the Wood Elves, have incredibly pale skin, a fair complexion, and usually have white hair, but can have shades of red or blonde as well. They are especially skilled in the magical arts, but also are devout clerics and paladins to their goddess, Tunare. They are generally good natured towards others, but are usually very arrogant towards others and think highly of themselves because of their intelligence. Only the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Erudites</a> surpass them in intellect (and look down on the High Elves in terms of arrogance because of this fact.) They typically live to be about 800 years old.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII">EverQuest II</a></em> (which takes place 500 years in the future and in an alternate timeline,) the city of Felwithe had undergone significant changes as a result of their own king being assassinated during a war with the Dark Elves. This lead the ruling council to declare that the High Elves must revert back to the original elven race they once used to be. Through the use of magic and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">inbreeding</a>, the High Elves turned themselves into the Renda'Dal, or "New Elf". They grew slightly shorter and have more prominent elvish features such as longer ears and thinner faces, and shortened their lifespan to about 150 years (in order to ensure their racial survival by enforcing the need to procreate more often). They have also shunned all outside contact with other races. Even other High Elves who lived outside of the city were no longer welcome. Everyone who entered "New Tunaria" were treated as hostile.
</li><li> Going even further, the immortal vampire Mayong Mistmoore has taken an interest in the Renda'Dal. Using some of them as subjects for experimentation in the catacombs under his own castle, another race was created. Most of the experiments resulted in the hideous disfigurement of the test subject, turning them into troglodyte creatures akin to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeMachine">Morlocks</a>. These rejected test subjects were thrown out and forced to live in the lower caves of the catacombs. Enough of them have gathered together to form their own primitive society of sorts. They wish to only be left alone and attack anyone who comes near. They have been branded as the "Myr'Dal", or "Cave Elf."
</li></ul></li><li> Teir'Dal: Dark Elves: Innoruuk, the God of Hate, was jealous of Tunare's creations, so he stole away the first king and queen of the original good natured elven race and warped and twisted them into the Dark Elves. Standing 5 feet tall, have dark blue skin, white hair, and share the same aesthetic qualities as the Wood Elves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenSkinnedSpaceBabe">(Blue is sexy)</a>. They live in the underground city of Neriak and are faithfully devoted to Innoruuk. They are adept in the practice of magic, which also includes Necromancy. Other professions include warriors, assassins, and shadowknights. Despite being evil for the most part, there are some Dark Elves who have proven that they are not inherently evil by nature and work for the forces of good. Dark Elves typically live about 600 years old.
</li><li> Ayr'Dal: Half Elves: Always the offspring of a human and one of the three elven races, most commonly Wood Elves. Half Elves can be good or evil, depending on who raised them. Standing 5 feet tall, Half Elves have more human features, including slightly rounded earss, facial hair, and a skin complexion ranging from any of the three parent elven races (except they're never nearly as blue as Dark Elves naturally are.) The Half Elves call themselves "Ayr'Dal", meaning "Outcast Elf", brought on by the fact that they have no racial culture or heritage to call their own. They've actually taken this lack of culture and used it as their own. They usually have a appearance to reflect their nonconformity towards society, including Mohawks, facial piercings, and a general rebellious teenager attitude towards others.
</li><li> Although not a playable race, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuestII">EverQuest II</a></em> introduces the Sul'Dal. A long forgotten race of Elves who shied away from worshipping Tunare, and turned to Anashti Sul, the (now former) Goddess of Health. Anashti wished to give the gift of Eternal Life to Norrath in order to "Cure Death", and unintentionally released the undead on the planet (which the other gods did not take kindly to, and banished her to the Void as a punishment.) The Sul'Dal were granted eternal life by becoming undead. Some among the community believe that "Sul'Dal" translates into "Sand Elf", but given the connection to Anashti Sul, it is more widely believed that "Sul'Dal" translates into "Eternal Elf". Living within the Sul'Dal's city of Akhet Aken are also the Rin'Dal and Ara'Dal, who are believed to be social classes in their society rather than individual races.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>: Caster almost fits the High Elf example of this trope perfectly. Pointed ears, extremely proficient in magic, originally from a ancient kingdom, and she wears mostly purple. She also wears a somewhat tight fitting dress beneath the hood and cloak she is usually seen in. That said, this is only outwardly. As a Servant, she is significantly weaker than the others both by virtue of being a Caster and by some of the most powerful players being able to mitigate or straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">No-Sell</a> her attacks. Her Noble Phantasm, Rule Breaker, is also incredibly strong, but is a dagger and requires her to be at a disadvantageous range, meaning it's worthless most of the time. She is fully aware of this and both turtles in a nearly impregnable location and cheats by summoning Assassin (a Servant is not supposed to be able to summon another one) as a gatekeeper to deter others from trying to attack her. The only times she leaves are when everyone else has already picked each other off and there's only one other (known) Servant remaining, or when she sees an opportunity to great to pass up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>: The Guado fit the "Wood Elf" archetype fairly well. They tend to be agile and slender, possessing long limbs and claw-like fingers and styling their hair in a manner that resembles plants and roots. Their capital Guadosalam sits in an underground cavern beneath the Moonflow and contains an entrance to the Farplane, a place where the living can interact with the souls of the dead. Guado have a reputation for being arrogant but are usually generous and welcoming to guests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em>: The Elvaan race certainly may look the part of a classic elf race, with long bodies and pointed ears, but the resemblance ends there. They have a martial society where all the men (and presumably most of the women) are expected to have combat skills. They have little skill in magic, shown both by a lack of spellcasters amongst NPCs (in fact, the magic store acts surprised to get customers) and by the fact that their MP and INT are lower than average although they have good MND... they are more devout to Altana than any other race, and the few mages they do have are usually White Mages or Red Mages. They have little appreciation for art, with the city designed prioritizing function over form (although the palace has a fairly perfunctory opulence). But one thing they maintain to a tee is the arrogance. They view the other races (and all foreigners regardless of race) with derision, tolerating them only because of the global threat of the beastmen. That hardly prevents them from espousing their xenophobic beliefs on people. If you're not from San d'Oria, NPCs will insult your player character, claiming they don't have what it takes to stand with the Elvaan, <em>even if you're an Elvaan yourself</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>: The Elezen play this a bit straighter. However, it's only the Duskwight Elezen (basically Dark Elves) who can use offensive magic effectively, and they were actually the original Elezen race, having lived under caves for hundreds of years. The Wildwood Elezen are generally not as xenophobic, having in fact integrated with the human equivalent, but they are racist towards Duskwight Elezen, seeing them as traitors who would not fight and eventually ally with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansByAnyOtherName">Hyur</a> when the time came.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em>, on the other hand, clearly took the basic idea of elves and hammered it into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSexy">Rule of Sexy</a> mold as fiercely as possible: the Viera are a race of magical, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreAsMayflies">nigh-immortal</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace">all-female</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkSkinnedBlond">dark-skinned blondes</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayboyBunny">bunny ears</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyWhateverOutfit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyWhateverOutfit">wear lingerie all the time</a>.

They're antagonists in the relevant quest-line, since they want to end the villain's threat by killing him rather than curing him (as the quest-giver wants).

They are noted to be magically gifted, are often scholarly and also rather fond of living in small villages close to nature (though it's become more and more common to see them in large towns as well). Many of the recruitable Erune characters rely on magic and finesse to do damage rather than raw strenght. Unlike the archetype, Erunes seem to live normal human lifespans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>:

They are beautiful, magical, highly civilized, have an ancient civilization, are very loud about those facts, and are in severe decline as the younger, more energetic races begin to dominate the world.
</li><li> The Sylvari are a weird version of this, in that they're inherently magical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureHero">nature heroes</a>... but they're also straight-up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlantPeople">Plant People</a>, and the youngest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FiveRaces">Five Races</a>, having only started existing in the 250 year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between games.

</li><li> Elves/Wood Elves/Light Elves (all three terms were used at different points and in different contexts), a mix of the standard Wood and High Elves, but without the classic elven superiority (both in morality and in attitude), being pretty much human in those respects. Notably <em>not</em> subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaShave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaShave">Perma-Shave</a>.
</li><li> Dark Elves, quite possibly the <em>least</em> Dark Elf-like dark elves in a video game ever (as a civilization), aside from a liking of dark colours for their clothes and not being subject to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaShave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaShave">Perma-Shave</a>.

This is important because a character ages every time they rest and if they reach half their maximum life span, there's a chance that their stats may drop whenever they rest. The closer you are to your race's life-span limit, the bigger the chance of losing stat points. Because Oubliette runs on Vancian magic, a party is going to have to rest alot in order to keep up their spells and hitpoints.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em>: The elven races have a long and convoluted lineage. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, they originated from a specific tribe of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">trolls</a>, evolved by the magic of the Well of Eternity into the first night elves. At their pinnacle, their civilization surpassed the widespread troll tribes through mastery of both arcane and natural magic, putting them square in the middle of High and Wood Elf archetypes. Then their queen desired even more power and tried to strike a bargain with demons, which was barely thwarted at the cost of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">World Sundering</a>. The survivors split into several factions:
<ul><li> The modern night elves, or <em>kaldorei</em> ("children of the stars"), largely gave up on arcane magic because of fear of yet another catastrophe and decided to live in harmony with nature and study druidism from the demigod Cenarius. Their Wood Elven tendencies were shown with their giant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Treants">Treant</a> allies and heavy reliance on animals. While supposedly humble, their confidence in their chosen path became a major source of arrogance of its own over time, not helped by their immortality. Their allegiance to nature makes them a bit aloof to worldly matters; also, many Night Elves are thousands of years old and, because of their extreme age and conservatism, tend to be perceived as "haughty" by other races, and many players. Their former leader Fandral Staghelm played the arrogance card actively, but once he was ousted from power, the race has certainly mellowed out a lot and became more integrated into the Alliance. Realizing that being around Alliance sorcerers caused little harm, they even accepted back their own exiled mages, and they've lost their immortality due to the destruction of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldTree">World Tree</a> that provided it.
</li><li> High elves (<em>quel'dorei</em>, "children of noble birth"), on the other hand, were aptly named. They descend from the ancient night elf upper classes who, after the Sundering, refused to let go of arcane practices and sailed to the eastern continent, where they founded a flourishing kingdom. Unfortunately, they became dependent on a source of magical power known as the Sunwell; it was eventually corrupted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">the Scourge</a>, causing them more casualties than any other race. While some still remained high elves, many of the survivors named themselves "blood elves" (<em>sin'dorei</em>, "children of blood"), declared a policy of ruthless pragmatism, and even aligned themselves with the Horde when their former Alliance allies failed to come to their aid. While a few true high elves still remain here and there, they've largely vanished as a major race.
</li><li> The nightborne from the <em>Legion</em> expansion, or <em>shal'dorei</em>, are Dark Elves played straight: an extremely isolationist race descended from an old night elf population that shielded itself from the consequences of the Sundering in the magically protected city of Suramar. Much like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> drow, they are dark-skinned, mistrusting, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a>. They also have a bond with spiders; some of them are transformed into spider-like creatures to augment their abilities. Much like High Elves, they are also dependent on their own magical source, the Nightwell, to the point that a civil war over the rights to access it broke out. During the war, however, one faction discovered a less addictive mana source, and for the most part abandoned the Nightwell. Upset with the haughty attitude of the Night Elves when they helped liberate Suramar, they decided that they connected better with the Blood Elves and when War flared up, threw their lot in with the Horde.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfTheVoid">Void elves</a> or <em>ren'dorei</em> ("children of the void"), introduced in the space between <em>Legion</em> and <em>Battle for Azeroth</em>, are another Dark Elven race. The first technical void elf seen in-game is Alleria Windrunner, who absorbed the power of a fallen naaru, giving her the ability to change into a form with white hair and star-patterned skin. The later, playable void elves are blood and high elves who studied the Void, which led to the former group being exiled from Silvermoon, and were nearly enslaved by ethereals, but their transformation was stopped halfway through and they became blue-skinned elves (later given options for more natural tones) with shadowy, stylized energy "wings", slender tentacles in their hair, and newfound power from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons">Touched by Vorlons</a>. As the blood elf members had already been exiled for their experiments, they side with the Alliance.
</li><li> Felbloods, harpies, satyr and naga are elven derivatives mutated through exposure to wild, demonic, or Old God magic. The naga are admitted to be based on drow, with their leader Azshara taking inspiration from Lolth, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism">males no longer look the part</a>.
</li><li> The Wretched and Withered are high elves or nightborne denied access to their ambient sources of magic. They are frail and gangly, and more often than not tend to go irrevocably insane. Night elves, interestingly enough, seem to be largely immune to this kind of fate; then again, they seem to construct Moonwells wherever they go rather than relying on a single concentrated source of magical energy.
</li><li> Also trolls (ancestors of the aforementioned elves) to some extent. They're physically rather unlike have the long ears and have been cast as the Horde counterparts to elves since <em>Warcraft II</em>. One thing the elves have inherited from their troll ancestors is their genetic malleability. It really seems like elves can't so much as walk past a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceOfPower">Place of Power</a> without changing their skin color within a few generations.
</li><li> It's been argued that <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s revamp of the draenei count as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Space Elves</a>", what with being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudScholarRace">Proud Scholar Race</a> from another world and all-but they don't physically fit the elf stereotype much. (They have pointy ears, true... but they also have tails, horns, and hooves. And while the <em>females</em> are certainly lithe, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BizarreSexualDimorphism">their brothers are built like bank vaults</a>... and are permitted not only facial hair, but catfish whiskers.)
<ul><li> The same thing is true of the night elves. The males especially are built like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ZeroPunctuation">four brick shithouses stacked together</a> and have often quite bushy facial hair. The females are much more slender, but still quite muscular, like Olympic athletes. High elves have also been seen with beards, just not with as bushy ones.
</li><li> If you compare night elf males with their human counterparts, you'll notice they're actually <em>relatively</em> slender. It's just that the men in practically every species in the game appear to be built out of barrels. Still, the overall effect does leave night elves rather resembling the local trolls in shape, which makes sense as they're related.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warlords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warlords">Warlords</a></em> has three factions of Elves, the High Elves, Wood Elves and Dark Elves. The setting's backstory explains that they all used to be High Elves, before a Prince named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesToRunAwayFromReallyFast">Mordaine</a> dabbled in <strike>Demon</strike> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Daemon</a> Magic. When he brought his discoveries to his people, they were promptly rejected, despite him honestly just trying to help his people. As you probably can imagine, the whole thing escalated in a rather nasty civil war, ending with the Year of the Seven Fleets, a time when they simply built seven fleets and split up, forming new colonies around the world. Most of them still exist, but one of the Dark Elf ones blew up when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorsemenOfTheApocalypse">Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a> entered the world.

They like to think of themselves as superior, but are just as moronic, gullible, xenophobic and destructive as every other race. Possibly worse. In fact, they were responsible for oppressing the world for thousands of years with the help of evil dragons, caused at least one civilization to be incomprehensible because they had cooler stuff (namely Airships), have been exchanging atrocities with the dwarves for a long time for control of the Earth Orb, and have conquered the Giants to pillage their lands and use them as weapons.

They're very closely tied to the elements of wind and lightning, whereas humans are collectively balanced between all six. Physically, they share long, pointed ears and skin in shades of the sky; they also live longer than humans on average. They are often weather mages, and possess literally "airy" dispositions and less cultural or emotional stability than usual in humanity. Multiple populations exist, including the main divide between Wind elves (more tied to wind, taller and with lighter skin) and Storm elves (more tied to lightning, shorter, stockier, and with darker skin and smaller ears). Smaller groups include the Dark Elves, who live underground and have skin mottled with star-like spots, and the poorly-known Cloud Elves, an extremely isolationist folk who live in a chain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">floating islands</a> with little contact with other folk.

Largely as a result of the aforementioned immortality and being the only widespread species able to use magic, they're arrogant enough to consider humans and orcs dumb animals, enslave them, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAHumanitarian">use them for food</a>, but the whole thing is as much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a> as arrogance — for instance, food is scarce enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeneathTheEarth">Beneath the Earth</a> that they can't afford to let good meat go to waste.

If alone, they will begin to age and eventually die. Their ears also get more pointed as they age, as keratin is continuously laid down: young elves' ears are simple triangles, while long, sharply pointed ears are the only real sign of age in ancient elves.

Not only do they have the conventional "high/wood/sea/dark" elf distinctions (and then one of them gets huffy when a human points out this out after an elaborate lecture on the different groups), they have precisely the sort of snotty arrogance that typifies this trope, especially after they have spent a few centuries <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenElfVillage">in hiding</a> following the Errant Wars. But it is their treatment of half-elfs ('errants') that is most telling: they made a huge mess of things when they first encountered humans, then after this led to a bloody civil war, refused to do anything to clean up the mess except ruthlessly hunt down and kill their own hybrid descendants. The Errants exist because for some reason it's much easier to conceive Elf-Human hybrids than pure Elf children. The war happened later one when it turned out that Errants with magical power have a tendency to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity">suddenly go utterly insane</a>.

It also has these Elves breeding with humans to produce the Half-Elves, the vast majority of which live outside of Ilthmir and embrace their human side more.

They are stuck in prepubescent bodies for their entire life, and they are treated as dangerous second class citizens by the society around them.

They live in a forest city like Wood Elves, but in attitude are High Elves. When some of their kind are born without magic or immortality, they are banished, and the more they're shown the more unsavory they are—it becomes clear that they're complacent, arrogant racists who view everyone else as lesser beings, leading the main characters to declare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">Screw You, Elves!</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And the "mortality" disease is a punishment from the Spirit Realm.</span>

<ul><li> Elves are androgynous (to the point of not even using gendered terms or pronouns; elven children refer to their parents as "parent" and "other parent"), trance instead of sleeping, live in an isolationist woodland kingdom and worship their own set of gods. They have sharper senses than humans do, although as per <em>D&amp;D</em> rules this is a trait shared with halflings and dwarves.

Mostly averted in the rest of the series, where elves are short, not particularly attractive laborers at cookie companies and Santa's workshop (though they <em>do</em> get some cool black ops equipment).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TalesOfTheQuestor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TalesOfTheQuestor">Tales of the Questor</a></em> have elves with a <em>very</em> serious problem. In their past, the race had lifespans that were marginally longer than humans and one Elf monarch wanted to stop his people from aging. So, he made a deal with a magic giant salamander for a spell that would ensure Elves never got old, which unfortunately was done by limiting Elf lifespans to 20 years (Half-Elves live a bit longer). The King tried to fix this catastrophic problem by getting a magic goblet that can give immortality to any elf that drinks from it, which worked until it was stolen, destroyed, or otherwise lost (nobody remembers). As a result, Elf society collapsed, with a population unable to get enough maturity and the race degenerated to a bunch of petty thieves and vagrants with nothing to live for.

The half-elf Steff also both overestimates her keen elven eyesight and underestimates the nightvision of humans, on separate occasions.
</li><li> However, one of the reasons that elves used to be discriminated against are that they're <em>awesome</em>, as this professor explains...
<div class="indent"><strong>Professor Hart:</strong> Good? Good? Ms. La Belle, elves aren't "good"... they are better. These people can run twice as fast as you can without making a sound. They can see to the farthest horizon on a starless night and they can hear the heartbeat of a mouse. They don't sweat. If they fart, you'll never hear about it. They can go into a human town and <em>fuck</em> everybody's wives, sons, and daughters for fifteen hours straight, they are going to live <em>forever</em>... and can you imagine what would happen if the brand-new emperor had stood before his people and said, "Hey, these are the people who are going to be in charge of you." Do you think the people who had just thrown off one tyrant would have just rolled over and accepted that?
</div></li><li> Elves don't even need to <strong>breathe</strong>, but if they don't engage in mortal behavior, they start losing their connection to the world and become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">something else entirely</a>.

<ul><li> The elves, being one of the oldest races, are essentially the leaders of the Realm, housing seven powerful kingdoms and some of the most powerful warriors and wizards, including Virgo Sunsword of the illustrious Sunsword family. The other races that even attempt to be powerful or influential, like dwarves and gnomes, appear to mimic the elves.
</li><li> Dwelves, hybrids of dwarves and elves, on the other hand, are regularly hunted by dwarves and tend to reside in elven lands, where they are treated as equals, at least under the law.
</li><li> Gobolfs, deformed elves with traits similar to goblins, are cowardly, asthmatic creatures that elves disdain but tend to let live.

He is tall, handsome, proud, arrogant, loutish, and craven, with an instinctive penchant for selling out his allies in a pinch, extensive knowledge of the shockingly vicious traps with which his people have so nobly strewn their forest, no reservations about using violent coercion, and is full of tales of his many "petty, conniving, yet selfless" deeds: Soapy: "So your shooting me in the leg was actually very brave!"

They are divided into six tribes, each attuned to one of the six sources of magic — the sun, the moon, the stars, the sky, the earth and the ocean.
<ul><li> Moonshadow elves, the first ones seen, have skin in a range of human skintones and white hair, and can become invisible and extremely fast and powerful under the light of the full moon. For self-evident reasons, they are known to be fearsome assassins. Some also possess illusion-based magic, as the moon arcanum focuses on manipulating appearances and blurring the line between the real and the illusory. They also tend to have noticeable Scottish accents.
</li><li> Sunfire elves have dark brown skin and white or russet to black hair. They appear to be a more militant culture than other elves seen. They can make blades that always remain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlade">as hot as the day they were forged</a> and can cut through regular ones like butter, and can draw on the destructive power of fire and the sun to enter a state where they become extremely strong and powerful, but also berserk and uncontrolled.
