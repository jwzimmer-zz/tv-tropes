It may be the result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown">freak accident</a>, a plot on the part of the bad guys to incapacitate our heroes, or done on purpose so the characters can relive their childhood (at least temporarily). It may involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalAttributeSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalAttributeSwap">Physical Attribute Swap</a> with someone younger. Always central to the plot of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyMorphEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabyMorphEpisode">Baby Morph Episode</a>, which is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>.
</p><p>For some reason, this plot is often used in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFic">Fan Fic</a> where it's called a De-Aging story. Often combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaiseHimRightThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaiseHimRightThisTime">Raise Him Right This Time</a>.

These will, of course, be sought out by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">Immortality Seekers</a>. A downside to this version of the trope is that the fountain is usually stationary and often in a remote region, forcing the newfound immortal to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWantsToLiveForever">permanently stay close to it</a> or at least return regularly, and to keep it a secret from others due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">Immortality Immorality</a>.

</p><p>It's common for characters to overdo it in stories involving this trope, often winding up as babies, or possibly even regressing out of existence entirely. This may or may not be permanent, but if the character in question was a bad guy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaiseHimRightThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaiseHimRightThisTime">expect it to be permanent</a>; well, at least, until they grow back up the old-fashioned way.
</p><p>If the character's clothes don't change with them in this event (and it's shown onscreen), it's likely to cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingExcludesClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapeshiftingExcludesClothing">Shapeshifting Excludes Clothing</a>.

</li><li> In a commercial for Nickelodeon in the late 80s, a scientist is trying out a youth potion to make himself a kid again so he can watch "Kids only weekend". But when he drinks it, he turns into a baby which the announcer says "Sorry babies are too young to watch "Kids only weekend"
</li><li> There were a couple commercials for the candy Baby Bottle Pop that featured this trope.
<ul><li> Whenever kids were eating the candy their heads became that of a baby.
</li><li> In one, teens at a dance are bored and eat the candy and anyone who ate one is turned into a cartoon baby.
</li></ul></li><li> In an ad for the PS2, we are shown the aftermath of this. In a nursing home, we see empty halls with discarded clothes with no one in sight. A clock is shown moving backwards and then we see naked babies crawling around.
</li><li> In a commercial for Bojangles, an old man shows off his Bojangles box. An old woman isn't impressed and drinks a water fountain to become young again and says "I found the water fountain of youth". We see the man again and he's not impressed. We then see the woman has turned into a girl around 13 and she walks away.
</li><li> In a commercial for Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo, we see a woman smiling at the camera and bubbles covering the screen. Every time this happens she becomes younger from adult to pre-teen to child and then to baby.
</li><li> A long-running series of commercials on American television for Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal had various adults stating to the camera their "serious adult side" approves of the cereal's nutritional value. Then they'd suddenly become children in oversized clothes and continue explaining, in the same voice, the "kid in them" enjoys the frosted sweetness. Sometimes they'd reverse the bit, with a child becoming an adult.
</li><li> There was a commercial for some sort of body wash where football players showering after a game using the product transformed (off-camera) into infants.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/oHNSDMMwsg0">This commercial for the South African drink Steri Stumpie<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suggests that the drink will cause a mother and son to get 10 years younger if they drink it at the same time. Unfortunately, in this case, the son happened to be a bit younger than 10 years...

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In Chapter 28 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/The100GirlfriendsWhoReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLoveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/The100GirlfriendsWhoReallyReallyReallyReallyReallyLoveYou">The 100 Girlfriends Who Really Really Really Really Really Love You</a></em>, all the girls except Hakari are temporarily turned into babies thanks to one of Kusuri's drugs.
</li><li> Because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown">Heaven's computer crashed</a>, this happened to Urd for about two chapters in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em> manga (and one episode of the 2005 animé), with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvernightAgeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvernightAgeUp">the reverse happening</a> for youngest sister Skuld. Fortunately, she was able to get an interesting advantage out of it.
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkazukinChacha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkazukinChacha">Akazukin Chacha</a></em>, the main trio is tricked by some bad guys into drinking rejuvenation potion, and turn back into babies. Seravy and Dorothy are also reverted to kids. Of course, they all turn back at the end.
</li><li> A plot used multiple times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Anpanman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Anpanman">Anpanman</a></em>. A couple episodes have had Baikinman make a spray that changes anyone (or anything) in contact with it into babies (with objects becoming earlier stages, like a tree becoming a sapling). He does this as ways to make Anpanman weak against him, but it always gets foiled in the end. One theatrical short showed there's an entire lake, one side red, which turns the victim into a baby, the other side blue, which returns them to normal. Another theatrical short had Hiyariko, an aspiring scientist, create a potion to make Baikinman stronger...only to turn him into a baby. When he runs off, she makes what she thinks is an antidote, and sprays it all around the town...only to turn the entire town into babies. Thankfully, this potion was only temporary, and everyone returned to normal eventually on their own.
</li><li> This is part of the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsatteNoHoukou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsatteNoHoukou">Asatte no Houkou</a></em>: when they both happen to meet at the same time in front of a wishing stone, a young woman transforms into a little girl, and vice-versa. It is implied they change back at the end of the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackCat">Black Cat</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Creed</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Doctor</a> did in the anime instead) accidentally shoots Train with a Lucifer bullet, causing Train to transform back into a child (around 8 years old). It only lasts one episode (or a few chapters).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>: a non-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Omake">omake</a> has the main cast regress to adolescence and, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Balalaika's</a> case, beyond. For the record, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe">loli-Balalaika</a> is the cutest thing ever. The most shocking ones are Yolanda (the old nun), who was a delicious and <em>hot</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasCake">cake</a> at 29 and Balalaika's underling Boris, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">Bishounen</a> to the max.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neliel Tu Oderschvank originally had the appearance of a late teenager/young woman, but after being attacked by her rival Nnoitra and having him crack her Hollow mask, she ended up reverting into a small child.</span> Later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Urahara uses his devices to let her return to her original age.</span>
</li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrigadoonMarinAndMelan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrigadoonMarinAndMelan">Brigadoon: Marin and Melan</a></em>, Marine eats some weird chocolate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MushroomSamba">that causes her to start hallucinating</a>. Among other things, she imagines herself <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvernightAgeUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvernightAgeUp">growing into a young adult</a>, then regressing into a baby.
</li><li> In the early chapters of <em>Chronos Ruler</em>, a teacher in her forties wished to one of the Horologues to get her youth back, and by the start of the series looks like a young woman. Too bad for her, she ends up becoming <em>too</em> young the next day; after she turned into a child, she tried to approach the Horologue in question to ger her time back, only for the Horologue to quickly suck out the <em>rest</em> of it, regressing her out of existence. This serves as a dire introduction to those demons' true nature.

After trying an anti-aging potion, Mrs. Todd was turned into a schoolgirl and forced to attend school with her daughter, posing as "Cousin Emily".
</li><li> The trope shows up in a few stories of the German comic anthology <em>Gespenster Geschichten</em>. Being a horror comic, it always ends badly for the victim:
<ul><li> In the story "Das Geheimnis der verhexten Kamera" (The Secret of the Haunted Camera), young actor John Steven is tired of only getting to play roles as an extra, and becomes so desperate to make his own movie that he attempts to rob a bank. In trying to escape the police, he ends up in an old, decrepit warehouse studio, where he finds an old director. After Steven vents his rage on him, the director pushes a button on a magic camera, making the young actor regress in age until he disappears offscreen, with the film screen representing his life burning away.
</li><li> In "Das Geheimnis des Zaubertrankes" (The Secret of the Magic Potion), Tibetan monks have managed to develop an elixir of youth, but have yet to test it on humans. When a young monk tries to drink it to test it, he gets kicked out before he can swallow a sip. Angered, he plots with an old English explorer to try and steal the potion, but they get cornered; with nowhere left to go, the Englishman drinks the entire elixir and becomes younger until he vanishes, only leaving his clothes behind.
</li><li> In "Wen die Stunde Schlägt" (When the Hour Strikes), an old man named Colin is approached by the Grim Reaper. When he laments that he hasn't even written his will yet, the Reaper accepts to give Colin three minutes so he can write the will, leaving an hourglass by his side that symbolizes how much time he has left. Feeling he has nothing to lose, Colin flips the hourglass over, and upon seeing that the Reaper hasn't come back after the allotted three minutes <em>and</em> the fact that he's become a young man again, rejoices in the fact that he essentially found eternal life... until he later becomes <em>too</em> young and turns into a child, unable to reach the hourglass before it is too late. The Reaper comes back just in time to see Colin turn into a baby and vanish, and reclaims his hourglass.
</li><li> In the story "Die Uhr des Sensenmannes" (The Clock of the Grim Reaper), a young woman named Samantha is lamenting the fact that her father is dying from an incurable disease, with the Grim Reaper on his way to claim his soul. As he arrives, Samantha manages to steal his hourglass, threatening to destroy it; left with no choice but to relent, the Reaper leaves, and the father makes a miraculous recovery. Samantha keeps the hourglass to use as leverage, but when rats come and topple it, she realizes time is flowing backwards, causing her to get younger by the second before disappearing. The Reaper comes back, reclaims his hourglass and claims the father's soul, ensuring that Samantha can never be born again.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AthenaVoltaire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AthenaVoltaire">Athena Voltaire and the Isle of the Dead</a></em>, it's recounted that a Spanish explorer discovered the Fountain of Youth. The effects lasted a while but had to be refreshed from time to time. Eventually, however, he noticed that the Fountain was showing signs of depletion; rather than risk returning one day to find it gone, he filled up as many barrels as he could. The ship he put them on, however, was sunk  setting up the plot.

Frankenbeans attempted to use it to his advantage by tricking the Madballs Horn Head, Wolf Breath, and Touchdown Terror into diving into a pool of the water, causing them to become the Madball Babies. In the end, Frankenbeans found infant Madballs to be even more difficult dealing with, so he had them restored to their normal ages by asking them to dive into the toxic pond where the Madballs were originally created. In retaliation to being reduced to infancy, the age-restored Madballs expose Frankenbeans and Snivelitch to the Fountain of Youth, turning them into children.

</li><li> The Vulture, who had learned his original flight harness had given him terminal cancer, obtained a new suit that allowed him to steal the life-force of his victims. Spidey would temporarily lose his vitality to this and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActuallyADoombot">Actually a Doombot</a> mother had her own vitality drained.

So the producers replaced the twentysomething actress with an eight-year-old. The official explanation was that this was a side effect of Den-O's efforts pushing the future closer to Hana's home timeline rather than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> the villains wanted to create.
<ul><li> After the third movie, the show's star moved on to other projects, and thus this happened to protagonist Ryotaro as well.

When he uses the device on his wife Meredith who is in the last stages of terminal skin cancer, she is initially restored to perfect health with has no memory of the last 17 months. However, within less than a minute, the process reverses and kills her. Noah is fired and narrowly avoids a manslaughter charge. He resumed his work in secret about a year later. His attempt to regress a frog results in it reverting to a tadpole but it soon dies in the same fashion as Meredith. After his new neighbor Barbara Matheson refers to the balance of nature, he realizes that he must create a natural equilibrium; in order for one organism to regress in age, another must become older in tandem. He goes over to Barbara's house to tell her the good news but finds her barely alive on the floor, having been beaten severely by her husband Greg. As she is bleeding internally, he doubts that she will survive long enough for him to bring her to a hospital so he uses the cellular regressor on her. The 65-year-old Barbara regresses in age about 40 years so that she is once again a jazz singer in her early 20s named Barbara Spencer (with the stage name of Barbara Dumont). She is under the impression that it is 1957 and that she is engaged to Greg, a kind, sweet man. She does not initially believe Noah, who has aged in tandem when he tells her that it is 1998 and her youth has been restored but she is convinced when he shows her a photograph of her marriage to Greg. It turns out that Greg has been secretly observing them and wants Noah to restore his youth. However, he doesn't believe Noah when he says that the polarity reverses each time that the transfer is made and sits in the wrong chair. As a result, Greg ages to death while Noah is restored to his youth, having lost all memory of everything that has happened since Meredith's death. Barbara takes care of him and it is suggested that the two of them will live happily ever after.
