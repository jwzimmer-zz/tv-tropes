The program's opening credits promise wondrous things — its images of stupendous beauty, righteous butt-kicking, and noble heroes make it clear what's to come in the story. Except, once you get into the program, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellThisIsNotThatTrope">you never see those things again</a> — and sometimes, you see the <em>exact opposite</em>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DotHackSign">.hack//SIGN</a></em>: We're treated to an Electronica-esque opening song with a ton of technicolor visuals. The major characters come onto screen one at a time looking like they're dancing, as well as falling through a data-field while their clothes gradually disintegrate. There's also a female character in a red and blue bodysuit and visor featured VERY prominently. None of this appears at all in the show. The girl in the body suit doesn't even EXIST. The only things that come close are the screen gradually "breaking" over a face shot of Tsukasa, and a very brief shot at the end showing the sleeping Aura (And the bodysuit girl in what looks like the REAL world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGameComeToLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGameComeToLife">which makes even less sense</a>). The show itself is more brooding, and introspective than anything else with most of the very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">Mind Screw-y</a> plot handled via exposition which only serves to make the upbeat opening even MORE jarring.
<ul><li> It's <em>possible</em> that the opening is symbolic of the fact that the show takes place in a virtual world, hence the girl in the VR goggles and suit and the dissolving clothes while falling could symbolize the shifting of realities. It's also possible the unnamed girl represents <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tsukasa, who's hiding his true gender</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>:
<ul><li> The opening credits of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalVideoAnimation">OVA</a> series briefly show Mara but she never actually appears in the series itself. This was apparently due to the animators being unable to animate her hair correctly.
</li><li> The opening credits show <em>a lot</em> of characters from the original manga that do not appear in the OVA. This includes Banpei the robot, Yoko the ghost, etc.
</li><li> They also show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Demon Belldandy</a> spreading dark wings over the city, while her friends watch below. That never happens. Instead, Belldandy's pureness turns the demon into an angel within minutes.
</li></ul></li><li> Both openings to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AkahoriGedouHourLovege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AkahoriGedouHourLovege">Akahori Gedou Hour Lovege</a></em>, fitting to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Widget Series</a> nature of the program, are really only true in the protagonists' minds. Kaoruko and Aimi never destroy anything that poses an actual threat to the city, and the Gedou Otome Tai never summon an army of demons to wreak havoc on the city.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsobiAsobase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AsobiAsobase">Asobi Asobase</a></em> has a cute and fluffy song with visuals of the three protagonists in white sundresses with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YuriGenre">copious lilies everywhere</a>, suggesting that it's an easygoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlSeries">Schoolgirl Series</a>. In actuality, the series is a surreal comedy featuring the girls being moronic jerks to each other and everyone else. The ending theme, "Inkya Impulse", which is a heavy metal song featuring surreal neon scribbles of the girls while Hanako screams about popular girls, is more in line with the series' true tone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, the OP shows people heroically fighting and killing Titans — most of the fights with Titans don't go that way, and a lot of people die in every fight. Also, one part of the opening specifically shows Eren, Mikasa, Annie and Jean fighting a Titan together — this never happens. Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren never kills a Titan as a human until the second season</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Baccano">Baccano!</a></em> looks like a funny, lighthearted (albeit chaotic) romp about 1930's America; complete with a lovable, happy-go-lucky cast and a series name that means "big ruckus." Hell, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wInHktd7hU">theme-song,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with its sitcom-esque cinematography, is catchy enough to get anyone revved up to laugh at some silly, old-timey antics and kick back with a show that's fun for the whole fami— SO MUCH BLOOD.
<ul><li> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">despite being a main character, Claire goes unnamed in the intro to avoid spoiling the surprise — though he's there for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment.</span>
</li><li> His significance is spoiled very subtly as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the shot of him does a slight stutter</span> as it does for the main cast, just minus the name card.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening animation to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleSpiritsShonenGekihaDan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BattleSpiritsShonenGekihaDan">Battle Spirits Shonen Gekiha Dan</a></em> shows the protagonist Dan using the DarkDragonEmperor Siegfried. Throughout the series, he's never even in possession of this card.
</li><li> The opening theme to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk1997" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Berserk1997">Berserk (1997)</a></em> shows very little of the plot, being mostly comprised of various shots of Guts walking around and posing, his equipment, a flower bursting into flames, and a split second of blood splatter. The only actual image that informs the series is a shot of a tree with bodies hanging from it. It tells very little about the series, but more relevantly, the opening theme is a rather upbeat rock song mostly comprised of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousEnglish">Gratuitous English</a> (with its most prominent lyrics being "put your glasses on, nothing will be wrong"). Anyone familiar with <em>Berserk</em> will tell you that it is <em>not</em> an upbeat show about how things are going to be okay. Particularly funny is that "Even mother will show you another way!" plays over the aforementioned shot of the tree—those familiar with <em>Berserk</em> will tell you that tree is important because Guts's mother <em>was hanged there</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em> is rife with these, showing characters in different costumes and situations that you would never expect. The worst offenders were the second and fourteenth openings, which promised many really cool battles in the Soul Society that never happened.
<ul><li> The eighth opening shows filler captain Amagai fighting his third seat, Kifune, after the latter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. It's misleading because Izuru ends up fighting Kifune and also because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amagai is the real villain and was manipulating Kifune</span>. Not to mention the part where Renji attacks Byakuya with his signature move, only to have it deflected, which never happens in the show at all.
</li><li> The 10th opening is similar, as it's essentially just a music video featuring Rukia, Orihime, and Rangiku dancing, with a few shots of the Shinigami and Ichigo just to remind us that we're watching the right show.
</li><li> The last opening shows Ichigo fighting Tsukishima and Shishigawara <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">alongside Ginjou</span>. While it seems to be true considering how <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ginjou subjected Ichigo to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> to fight Tsukishima</span>, we later find out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ginjou was actually in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBadDuumvirate">Big Bad Duumvirate</a> with Tsukishima</span>. Furthermore, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ichigo never even fights Shishigawara at all, nor does he fight with fullbring outside the Xcution hideout before achieving his second stage</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Although the general wackiness of the openings fit the theme of the show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoboboboBobobo">Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo</a></em> includes the character Battleship among the main cast, yet after his run as a villain he disappears, except for occasional appearances, usually knocked out by the current villain. The same occurs with Suzu in the second opening, who only joins the main crew for one arc, and doesn't really do much. But then again, it's Bo-Bobo. It may have also been an attempt to subvert the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">Spoiler Opening</a>.
</li><li> The fourth season opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Boruto">Boruto</a></em> shows an alliance of school-age ninjas from multiple villages coming together to fight a giant ice monster which resembles one of the Tailed Beasts. Nothing remotely like that happens in the series.
<ul><li> Season five's intro has Boruto and his team going up against a mysterious cloaked villain with a metallic arm. Who is he? He's nobody, because no one like that appears anywhere in the series.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrainPowerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrainPowerd">Brain Powerd</a></em>, the opening consists of naked girls flying around everywhere. but the actual series is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> show with minimum nudity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">Faux Symbolism</a> ensues.
</li><li> The first opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BrynhildrInTheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BrynhildrInTheDarkness">Brynhildr in the Darkness</a></em>, used from episodes 1-9, prominently features Valkyria, who doesn't appear until episode 10. It also shows Hatsuna, who doesn't appear until episode 11, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">Hexenjagd</a> who, aside from a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BilingualBonus">mostly</a>) incomprehensible cameo in episode 7, don't appear until episode 12. Both openings depict an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> Valkyria fighting Neko, which never quite happens. On the other side of the coin, the second opening (used in episodes 10-13) features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningCredits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToOpeningCredits">Nanami</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who is killed off <em>five minutes</em> into Ep.10</span>, and the female student Murakami tutors (Kikka), who doesn't appear at all in those episodes.
</li><li> The opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Campione" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Campione">Campione!</a></em> prominently features all four main girls, despite Liliana only showing up past the halfway mark and Ena making her only appearance in the final arc.
</li><li> The first opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> shows Lelouch riding a white horse, something that never happens in the show. The show's creators have said that the scene is metaphorical, but what exactly it means they didn't say. The first opening for the second season has a similar scene, which differs in that it ends with Lelouch glaring at what appears to be a coastal military base — again, something that has yet to happen.
<ul><li> This opening also makes it seem as though Prince Schneizel would be a major villain, as the credits end with him smirking at Lelouch and Lelouch glaring back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He doesn't become a major villain until <em>R2</em></span>.
</li><li> Additionally, the show's last opening shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Black Knights attacking Schneizel's flying fortress Damocles</span>, when in the actual series, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Schneizel manipulates the Knights into betraying Lelouch/Zero, meaning that they fight to <strong>defend</strong> Damocles.</span>
<ul><li> Also, it shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ganymede armed with the same kind of nuclear sakuradite weapon from the end of the first season and the Sutherland Sieg in what seems to be space (?) shooting a barrage of missiles. These, of course, never happen.</span>
</li><li> Then there's <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Code_Geass_group2.JPG">this pic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> showing C.C. hanging with Lelouch's friends, though Nina, Milly and Shirley never meet her.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DarkerThanBlack">Darker Than Black</a></em> shows falling stars scene and Amber cradling Hei's head, in the second version, Hei fighting against several clones of himself — neither happens in the series. In other respects, though, the clones scene is pretty similar to one in the OVA.
<ul><li> The cake goes to the second season OP, which barely has Hei in it at all, prominently has the schoolkids from the first episode playing at the beach, and has Suou travelling alone, save for her absurdly cute pet... squirrel... thing. It took a lot of flak for those reasons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One classmate gets turned into a Contractor very early on and kills another one, the rest have their memories of Suou and said Contractor friend erased, Hei is still the real main character, Suou very rarely travels alone and that squirrel is actually Mao from S1 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">Back from the Dead</a>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother">Dear Brother</a></em>'s opening features many pretty dolls, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyDoll">some of them being quite creepy</a>. They're seen in a rather luminous and jewelry-full environment, but in the series itself <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> one of them is actually in Rei's very dark <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoomFullOfCrazy">apartment full of crazy</a>.

</li><li> Ren and Miu start the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearS">DearS</a></em> opening off with an intensely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> kiss. Ren in-series is completely fixated on Takeda and Miu doesn't particularly like her, though there's a moderate amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Les Yay</a> available.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DeathParade">Death Parade</a></em>, the opening is a catchy, jaunty tune that's sure to get you up on your feet. With lyrics like "everybody, put your hands up!" shouted in excitement, and scenes of the cast dancing, jumping around, and drinking, it almost makes you believe that this show is going to be the anime version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>. That is, until you get to the part where the show becomes a high-tension psychological drama that takes place in the afterlife and forces a newlywed couple to play a game that causes each player extreme physical discomfort if they ever want to get out alive...
</li><li> A half-example with the second OP for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DemashitaPowerpuffGirlsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DemashitaPowerpuffGirlsZ">Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z</a></em>, as the series delivered <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Powerprof, Dynamo Z and the bit with the volcano, but didn't get round to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a> or the Super Zero costumes</span>.
</li><li> The girls from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiamondDaydreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiamondDaydreams">Diamond Daydreams</a></em> are shown in the opening credits as if they form a group of close friends. Although this would have offered some interesting possibilities, only some of them meet up shortly in the last episode.
</li><li> The credits sequence for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiGiCharat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DiGiCharat">Di Gi Charat</a> Nyo!</em> is perhaps the king of Bait and Switch Credits sequences, showing the cast participating in <em>multiple</em> genres that the series very much isn't. Almost certainly a parodic use of the trope, but it still wins for sheer volume of misleadingness.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DimensionW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DimensionW">Dimension W</a></em>, the opening mostly consists of Kyouma battling various gangsters and dancing. While he does fight gangsters in the first episode, this essentially serves as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionPrologue">Action Prologue</a> that leads to him meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Mira</a>, and the rest of the anime has no gangsters whatsoever. As for the dancing, that's so ridiculously out of character for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Kyouma</a> that it comes across as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm">Narm</a>.
</li><li> The original Saban-controlled <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> OP for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> wasn't <em>technically</em> bait-and-switch, but the spirit was sure there. 90% of the clips were either taken from the <em>Dead Zone</em> movie or from the Cell Saga — which also not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">spoiled the Super Saiyan transformations of Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta, but also the appearance of Trunks</a>. The theme song was catchy, though. Ironic considering that FUNimation didn't reach Trunks for several years after the first two seasons started airing due to lack of funding.
<ul><li> <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>'s 2nd OP makes it look as if the show will follow Gohan and his Saiyaman adventures, and it does, for a handful of episodes before Goku returns and a new villain shows up, but the opening never changes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em> (the new director's cut of Z) also has a bait and switch. The end credits feature Launch, a character who was prominent in Dragon Ball but who has barely any appearances in Z... and the one sequence she <em>does</em> appear in was cut out of Kai because it wasn't in the manga.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallKai">Dragon Ball Kai</a></em> in general uses new artline invented for video games and post-2000s movies for the intros and endings, but the whole series is a blatant copy-and-paste of the original 1989 adaptation, where nothing improves besides the coloring and pacing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>'s 2nd OP features the main characters fighting in the upcoming Tournament of Power, including some surprising faces like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHappenedToTheMouse">Android 17</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">While Android 17 is present on the team, Majin Buu is not - he's incapacitated just before the tournament begins, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">forcing the team to revive Freeza to take his place</a>. The OP then changes to reflect this.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>'s second opening introduces five new characters, three of which showed up briefly in the first half of the series. This means they're important, right? Not really. Only one was actually important, three of the others played bit parts, and one didn't show up <em>at all</em> in that cour save for the direct-to-DVD epilogue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em>'s opening does have some elements of the heavy fanservice featured in the show, but is played over a soothing Gregorian chant about divine justice and Art Nouveau-inspired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Moe">Moe</a> imagery, most likely meant to convey innocence rather than sensuality. The ending is also a pop love song that may match the show in the lyrics, but <em>not</em> in tone.
</li><li> The credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld">El-Hazard: The Magnificent World</a></em> show a number of things that never come to pass, most notably Makoto flying over the lands of El-Hazard (when flight is <em>not</em> the power he gains from the transit between worlds), and giggly pacifist nymphomaniac Allielle wielding a nasty-looking sickle as a weapon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>'s second opening depicts Shirou and Archer facing off inside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldOfBlades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieldOfBlades">Unlimited Blade Works</a> reality marble a la the Unlimited Blade Works scenario in the game. They never do, as the anime stays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationDistillation">mostly with</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticAdaptation">the Fate scenario</a>.
<ul><li> That scene was a <em>double</em> bait and switch, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Archer was killed off just before this opening began airing. Thus the intro led viewers to believe that Archer would be brought back to life. He wasn't</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2019 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em> anime ending focuses on Yuki above the other Sohma characters, and features two shots highlighting his relationship with Tohru, a freeze-frame as they walk past each other and then at the very end when he looks up at her and smiles. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As Fruits Basket is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoujo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoujo">Shoujo</a> series, most newcomers would probably assume this means they end up together. But nope - while Tohru is very important to Yuki, he ultimately realises that his feelings for her were entirely platonic, and they both end up with different people.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a></em> gives a rather prominent role to Hohenheim, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">showing him as a teenager</span> as well as providing two extended shots of his present-day self. Despite this, Hohenheim gets <em>less than ten seconds</em> of screen time until after the opening switches.
</li><li> The second <em>Brotherhood</em> opening shows <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">King Bradley</span> fighting in a heated battle against Ling, Lan Fan, and Fu. However, not only is it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> in the episodes that feature this fight, Lan Fan is unconscious from the word go and Fu doesn't even show up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to helping Maria Ross in Xing</span>!
</li><li> The fourth <em>Brotherhood</em> opening features Major Miles and a column of Briggs tanks going head to head with Sloth and Kimblee. This of course, doesn't happen, awesome as it would have been. There's also a brief shot of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fu and Lan Fan</span> fighting Envy, but that doesn't happen either, though it did spoil their return.
</li><li> The fifth and final <em>Brotherhood</em> opening features Winry turning into Truth, which has no relation to any event in canon and was probably a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">Red Herring</a> to the <em>real</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">spoiler</a> of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edward's Gate of Truth dissolving</span>.
<ul><li> Some have suggested it's symbolic the first time Ed opened the Gate, the woman in his life and on his mind was his mother, who he sees outlined in bright light like Truth, but by this time in the series, the woman in his life is Winry, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his future wife</span>. It could also reflect his goal; Trisha's revival was his goal when his journey first began, while Winry's affections became his goal after his journey ended.
</li></ul></li><li> In general, almost none of the fight scenes in <em>Brotherhood</em>'s credits actually happen between those characters. About the only one that does, Ed vs Scar, happens at night in the credits and in broad daylight in the show!
</li><li> The third opening of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a> features Edward and Alphonse fighting some dragon-looking monsters in a swamp. This never comes to pass in the series. Indeed, nothing even remotely close to these creatures appears in the series proper <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the very end, when Envy transforms into a very similar dragon on his way into the other world. He later appears, still as a dragon, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">movie</a></span>.
<ul><li> The fourth opening of the 2003 series shows Ed and Al vs. Gluttony and Lust, and Ed and Al vs. Wrath, Envy and Sloth. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ed and Al do fight Sloth and Wrath, but Lust is on their side in that fight and she and Sloth die in the fight while Wrath escapes. Envy abducts Al, preventing him from getting into any more fights, and Ed fights Envy in the finale, but loses, dies, gets better with Al's help and performs a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to save Al at the cost of being brought to the real world.</span>
</li><li> The fourth ending of the 2003 series shows Ed facing off against Envy and the rest of the homunculi except Greed and Pride in a graveyard. See the above spoiler for why this is a case of bait and switch.
</li></ul></li><li> The third ending focuses entirely on Winry, with the only shots of Ed and Al being a quick sequence of images at the very end. A non-fan could easily mistake the show's genre and main character if they only saw that ending and nothing else.
</li></ul></li><li> Looking at the OP for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em> you'd think that it'd be a cute, romantic high school <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoujoDemographic">Shoujo</a> in the vein of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KareKano">Kare Kano</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarmaladeBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MarmaladeBoy">Marmalade Boy</a>.</em> If you hadn't first watched season one, you might even think that it <em>was</em> one ...for about thirty seconds. At that point, the guy that you've pinned as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">stoic</a>, romantic male lead nonchalantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">blows up the locker room</a> with plastic explosive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GranblueFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GranblueFantasy">Granblue Fantasy</a></em>: In the opening sequence, one short scene just before the title has Gran jumping towards Bahamut with his sword in hand. While this implies that the dragon becomes a threat that the crew must face, it does not actually happen by any means during the entire season. Instead, Bahamut is benevolent, saves the party from the Hydra, and can offer its power to Gran's weapon at Lyria's command.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em>: The opening sequences are mostly composed of scenes that never happen in the show. Also, the main characters taking their clothes off for no clear reason. A particularly noteworthy sequence shows the Freedom and Destiny Gundams joining forces to battle a Destroy Gundam — when in fact, the Freedom and Destiny never once fought on the same side, even in "temporary truce for convenience" fashion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitVictoryGundam">Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</a></em>: The first opening is pretty upbeat and optimistic, with only a reaction shot or two from main character Uso to even hint at the bleak tone and setting of the series. The second opening is even more upbeat which furthers the separation as the end of the series gets even darker and bloodier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em> lies constantly in its openings. Most fans attribute this to the show's near-constant on-the-fly rewriting due to the production committee's ever-changing demands. Some images were also meant to be figurative but taken literally by most fans. Some of it was old-fashioned misdirection.
<ul><li> 2nd OP: The intro shows a big battle between Celestial Being and the combined military forces of all 3 prominent nations using their respective mobile suits, with almost each Gundam Meister squaring off against a rival mobile suit. The last part of the intro also shows the presence of three ominous-looking Gundams that the original Gundams from Celestial Being fight in space. In the actual show, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> each Gundam Meister instead falls into a trap, are separated from one another by each nation that focused on targeting one of them at a time, and the three nations, despite cooperating with one another, were still opposed to working as one lumbering force. As for the three new Gundams that appear in the intro, not only did Celestial being not face them in space (or in Allelujah's case, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">at all</a></em>), but they were not even the true antagonists for either the first season or second. In fact, in their first appearance, they rescue the ambushed Gundam Meisters from certain death. The true antagonists were absent from the intro.</span>
</li><li> 3rd OP: This OP shows the mobile suits Arios and Cherudim engaging Louise on Earth, Seravee against Ali and Patrick in space, and Setsuna clashing blades with Mr. Bushido in space. In the actual show, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Arios and Cherudim never directly faced off against Louise (while Louise does a real bait and switch herself; she's eventually piloting the stronger mecha in the same scene). When Mr. Bushido finally encounters Setsuna in space its not until after the 4th OP premiered and he's piloting a different (superior) suit to the one seen here.</span>
</li><li> 4th OP: This OP shows a naked Tieria who regained his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalGoldEyes">Supernatural Gold Eyes</a> indicating the recapture of Veda, the 00-Raiser shooting the Regnant to bits showing Setsuna's Co-pilot Saji reaching for the Regnant's pilot Louise in agony and Seravee Gundam battling Arche Gundam in space, ending with both mobile suits clashing blades as red beams again appear from Seravee's backpack. In the actual show, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tieria not only regained possession of Veda, but he also merged with it as Ribbons killed his physical body. Although Setsuna did shoot one of his comrade's girlfriend, it is not Saji's girlfriend Louise but instead Lyle's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent">Manchurian Agent</a> girlfriend Anew Returner. And the first and only time anyone battled Arche Gundam in space was in the 23rd and 24th episodes, where it was Cherudim that fought against it. The red beams shown emanating from Seravee's backpack was shown to be from Seraphim directly, when it first activated its TRIAL Field, an ability that was strictly Seraphim's own that needed Veda.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>: The first opening ends with a climatic battle between Heero and Zechs in outer space. That does eventually happen very late in the show, but not in the way portrayed here. Also there's a shot of Relena walking around a destroyed city, where no cities were really destroyed during the series at all. The second opening doesn't have any misleading details like this (save for one minor detail: Zechs is depicted as still wearing his mask for some reason, even though he has long abandoned it by that point), so the errors of the first OP are often attributed to rewrites that happened during Wing's troubled production.
<ul><li> Though the destroyed city later appears in a flashback scene in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz">Endless Waltz</a></em>, and <em>Episode Zero</em> reveals that Relena was there, too, finally giving a belated explanation for that scene.

<ul><li> The fifth opening implies that <em>all</em> Chimera Ants will be fighting the main hunters, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after Meruem is born and the Chimera Ant queen dies</span> the chimera ants split up and some of the chimera ants don't show up to fight them.
</li><li> The sixth opening also has Knov show up, while he doesn't get many lines of dialogue when the arc the opening is part of.

This is supposed to be impossible in-universe, as her power is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierWarrior">create walls</a>... then you notice that Megumi <em>was</em> using her barriers - to <em>block</em> said blast.
</li><li> The fifth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gintama">Gintama</a></em> opening makes the show seem a lot more serious and dramatic than it actually is. (For the first several episodes, it <em>did</em> accompany a comparatively serious story arc, but the key word here is "comparatively.")
<ul><li> A good chunk of Gintama's openings qualified. How many times do they show Gin engaged in epic battles? All the time. Does it ever happen? No.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13fp5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13fp5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13fp5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except when they do.</span> Then again, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrollingCreator">Trolling Creator</a>, so is it a surprise? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Then the series starts hitting the deeper pits of the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusRollercoaster">Cerebus Rollercoaster</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">in its later (and especially final) arcs</a>, and the openings fit right in.
</li><li> The anime's Slip Arc has an ominous shot of Shoyo and his pupils in the opening, with a brief cameo from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Utsuro</span> in his silhouette. Is this going to be an important plot point? Definitely, but <em>in the seasons that sandwich it</em>, as the Slip Arc was dedicated to all the chapters BNP skipped to get to the serious final parts.

The opening credits prominently feature Yumiko, making it appear as though her arc will be the main focus of the series. Sure enough, she's arguably the most prominent of the five girls during the first two episodes, due to her opposition to Yuuji, however her entire character arc is compressed into a single episode midway through the series, whereas Michiru and Makina's arcs get two episodes apiece and Amane's gets <em>four</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>, second season's second opening has a scene that was taken directly from a manga chapter where Hayate goes to Risa's house and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">they both end up being chased by a giant crocodile</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no Go</a></em> has a scene at the end of its last ending sequence which shows Hikaru and Sai playing against each other as equals, implying that someday Hikaru will reach Sai's level and be able to play against him in a fair match. Though Hikaru <em>wants</em> to do this, it never happens, and he's nowhere near Sai's level when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sai disappears permanently.</span>

They also barely qualified as one-shot characters in the televised series.
<ul><li> The first opening gives the impression that Peridot, Luna and Milky will be as prominent as the Jewelpets partnered with humans, but they're actually comic relief side characters with only one or two episodes dedicated to them.

The anime is actually a school/workplace fantasy comedy, and Chiari's outfit only ever shows up in the first episode.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPokaan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalPokaan">Magical Pokaan</a></em>'s haunting OP implies something of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">gothloli drama/horror</a>, despite it being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GagSeries">Gag Series</a>. According to interviews, this was actually a <em>mistake</em> — the songwriters were given a theme of soul-searching creatures of the night, but weren't told it was a comedy — but they just went with it and created matching footage.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em>:
<ul><li> The opening presents the show as a light-hearted school drama with three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girls</a> thrown into the equation, as well as presenting Mai, Natsuki and Mikoto as a strong-willed, determined <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sentai">team</a>- in reality, Natsuki doesn't get along with the other two, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FireForgedFriends">gradually becomes friends with them</a> just in time for things to get serious.

</li><li> Weirdly, the more sad sounding outro music is changed halfway through the season, just as things get dark, for another song, but they didn't swap the opening, making it seem deliberate.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiOtome">Mai-Otome</a></em>:
<ul><li> Similarly, despite already foreshadowing the darker themes, the first opening carefully tries to avoid any implication of conflict between Arika, Nina and Mashiro — instead, they are shown as happy with each other and enjoying their time together. Which is, of course, the exact opposite of their actual relationships.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">Aversion</a>: <em>Mai-Otome</em>'s second set of credits, which are appropriately darker, show Mai turning into a comet of flame and destroying literally hundreds of Slaves in one zooming pass. While it has the look of precisely the kind of over-the-top "see how impressive this character is" footage that typifies this trope, not only does she actually do exactly this in one of the final episodes, the production team in fact animated it a second time rather than reuse the credits footage. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(Although in the actual scene, Mai fights with Mikoto on her back, not alone as shown in the credits.)</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MasterOfMartialHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MasterOfMartialHearts">Master of Martial Hearts</a></em> has a rather unappealing, but otherwise lighthearted and optimistic opening. Its ending features a quiet and somewhat romantic song featuring its lead females in some rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">suggestive</a> moments. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">There's no way it would have possibly the worst ending with the worst plot twist ever</a>...

</li><li> The opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> center on a man with scraggly hair and a hunted look. He glances around as if afraid of being followed; in one shot he's holding a gun. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This man is the <em>hero</em> of the show. (The real "monster" does appear, but only for a second.) It's a sneaky example because it's not dishonest — Dr. Tenma is a murder suspect on the run, and his quest to kill Johan takes a constant toll on him.</span>
</li><li> The fifth opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a></em>, for the Provisional Exam arc, has a set of rapid-fire shots, placed prominently after the title card, of a red-haired man with goggles and a toothy grin. He never actually shows up in that arc, and since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonForeigner">he isn't from the manga either</a>, nobody in the fandom has the slightest clue who he is.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Narutaru">Narutaru</a></em>'s opening treats us with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundtrackDissonance">upbeat, cheerful opening song</a> with the characters drawn in cute grade-school drawing, ending with Shiina and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mon">mon</a> sleeping together in her bed.

</li><li> Virtually every opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> features activities of characters who really aren't doing anything at the time.
<ul><li> Especially during the filler seasons, when almost all the openings featured Sasuke and Orochimaru, despite neither of them making any appearance besides cameos.
</li><li> The openings in Part I (especially the first and fourth ones) give the impression that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChick">Sakura</a> often fights alongside her squad, but she's often set aside and forced to serve as a (somewhat ineffective) last line of defense for the people who need protection.
</li><li> The second version of the fourth <em>Shippuden</em> opening features members of Team 8 fighting the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMinibossSquad">Quirky Miniboss Squad</a> (Hinata vs. Gozu, Kiba vs. Kigiri, Shino vs. Nurari, Sakura vs. Rinji, and Sai and Naruto vs. Guren). Only the ones with Kigiri, Nurari and Guren happened.
</li><li> The twelfth ending features Sakura prominently, and makes the show look like it's a romance.
<ul><li> While the ending after that is <em>only</em> Hinata and makes it look like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a>!
</li></ul></li><li> The seventh opening to <em>Shippuden</em> is the worst, though. It features (in increasingly level of inaccuracy) Choji and Kakashi vs. Preta Pain; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight">Ino, Hinata, and Sakura vs. Konan</a>; Sai vs. Asura Pain; Kiba, Lee, Tenten, and Neji vs Deva Pain. In actuality, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Choji and Kakashi actually fight together against <em>Deva</em> Pain (and Asura Pain, sort of), Hinata tried to fight him later on, Ino didn't fight because she was working with her father getting some information, Sakura spent the battle treating the wounded and defending a hospital, Konan fought Shino and some other members of the Aburame clan (mostly off-panel in the manga, more is shown in the anime), Kiba fought Preta Pain with his mother (briefly and it was a bit longer in the anime), and Lee, Tenten, Neji, and Sai <em>never</em> fought because they were out of the village at the time (for the first three until after most of the fighting was over, for Sai the entire arc)</span> so <em>none</em> of those things ended up happening.
</li><li> All those have nothing on <em>Shippuden's</em> tenth opening, which features, in increasing order of implausibility/absurdity:
<ul><li> Naruto, Sakura, and Sai fighting Madara, Kisame, and Zetsu—all six of them <em>flying around</em>—, and unleashing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllYourPowersCombined">All Your Powers Combined</a> jutsu.
</li><li> The scene of Naruto <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">embracing his "shadow" self</span> transitioning from him about to do...<em>something</em> to Sakura. Though, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> that could be foreshadowing his later embracing of Kurama as an ally</span>.
</li><li> The Elder Toad shown alongside the villains.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The revived Akatsuki zombies</span> sliding into each other while their containers comedically topple in the background
</li><li> An out-of-nowhere dance routine featuring the Konoha rookies and the Sand Siblings, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigLippedAlligatorMoment">while the adults are shown prancing about synchronously on a tropical beach</a>.

</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A variation occurs with the first ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NEEDLESS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NEEDLESS">NEEDLESS</a></em>, which features three female cast members which would appear later in the series. Thing is, said ending is absolutely <em>stuffed</em> with fanservice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutenessProximity">Cuteness Proximity</a> situation and bright colors, blatantly presenting the girls as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians">Bait-and-Switch Lesbians</a>. The result feels like a crazy mix of gender-inverted <em>Boku no Pico</em> series and one of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> anime openings. Yet, only one of the girls is a canonical lesbian, and... well, <em>nearly</em> nothing presented in the ending is featured in the series.
</li><li> Two openings of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeoRanga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeoRanga">Neo Ranga</a></em> features all three female protagonists in white <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stripperiffic">Stripperiffic</a> outfits, having mysterious symbols painted on their bodies and wielding stone weapons. None of this happens.
</li><li> The opening sequence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> is fairly standard for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> series — the smiles on characters' faces, the panoramic views, the heroic and determined figure of Shinji Ikari standing tall with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticWind">the wind of a thousand cliches</a> blowing through his hair. It also completely belies the nature of the actual series. You will, however, catch glimpses of the mopey female trio along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleJars">People Jars</a>.
<ul><li> Another way to read the opening is it reinforcing the fact that Shinji is an angry passive-aggressive kid who will have to face the (end of the) world, like it or not. This interpretation is more common nowadays since fans look for signals towards a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">Gainax Ending</a> (though it's debatable how much of said ending was intended from the start. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> actually says the final ending was only decided three months in advance).
</li><li> It's also interesting that the "wings" of Unit 1 in the intro appear nowhere in the series — but make a prominent appearance in <em>The End of Evangelion</em>.
<ul><li> You do catch a brief glimpse of a creature with similarly-shaped wings at the beginning of the series. It's arguably foreshadowing that the Evangelions have more to do with the Angels than we are led to believe.
</li></ul></li><li> There's a monstrous multi-winged creature at the beginning of the opening that looks like an Angel and is covered in all sorts of weird letters. You can spot it right behind the "Gainax" title. Nothing like it ever shows up in the series, whatever it is.
<ul><li> Apparently, the thing is a representation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Samael</a>, or a Qabbalistic depiction of a seraph of some sort. So, toss that one in the same heap along with the sephira on Gendou's floor, etc.
</li></ul></li><li> It's worth noting that if one freeze-frames a lot in the last bit of the intro, there are all sorts of hints about much later events in the show. A patient person who wanted to take the OP apart frame-by-frame could probably guess a lot about the series even before watching it. Like the fact that AT Field means "Absolute Terror Field", for an example.
</li><li> Not to mention the song itself. While the upbeat, peppy melody isn't necessarily odd, as <em>NGE</em> is rather <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw5acgqIHQE">notorious<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">Lyrical Dissonance</a>, the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.animelyrics.com/anime/eva/ngetnshi.htm">lyrics themselves<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <em>also</em> seem to point to a more upbeat, standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> anime.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NininGaShinobuden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NininGaShinobuden">Ninin Ga Shinobuden</a></em> shows a dramatic battle involving most of the main cast against Shinobu's evil counterpart (see example image). Most of the final episode is in fact the characters complaining about this trope, as they scramble to end the show in a satisfactory way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheNoozles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheNoozles">The Noozles</a></em> does not involve dancing on rainbows with stars. The show does feature exciting adventures, but these get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">darker as the series progresses.</a> While the credits might make you think you are watching your typical "child has magical adventures and must hide them from parents" show, the show's actual plot is so strange that a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMakingThisUpDisclaimer">"Not Making This Up" Disclaimer</a> is often involved when describing it.
</li><li> The opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NurseWitchKomugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NurseWitchKomugi">Nurse Witch Komugi</a> R</em> paint <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lilia</span> as the main villain. She doesn't show up until the penultimate episode, and while she <em>is</em> evil, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">it's not willingly</a> (or even knowingly, for that matter).

<ul><li> The intro also shows Magical Nurse, Magical Sister and Magical Maid working together to defeat a monster. The three magical girls spend the entire series fighting amongst themselves until circumstances force them to work together in the finale, and even then their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombinationAttack">Combination Attack</a> doesn't take the form of a powerful energy beam like in the intro: instead, they pretty much defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfRock">singing at it</a></em>.

<ul><li> The eighth opening shows the Straw Hats relaxing, going shopping, enjoying themselves on the beach and acting out covers from the manga, making it seem very relaxing. This opening plays during the Enies Lobby arc, where they're attacking one of the most heavily defended government installations in the world, to save Robin from being taken away from them forever.
</li><li> The eleventh opening becomes a bit of a retroactive bait and switch, since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Straw Hats don't even appear or take part in the current storyline after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a>, save for Luffy</span>.
<ul><li> However, <em>in the anime</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">we still see them a lot because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Filler">filler</a> episodes adapted from covers showing what the Strawhats besides Luffy where doing</span>.
</li><li> The twelfth opening pulls this too. The first half of it is devoted to the Straw Hats having crazy adventures together, then it abruptly cuts to the current storyline, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which features Luffy alone.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The fifth opening also has a misleading moment where Nami pulls out a gun. While it <em>is</em> in the anime, it's during an incredibly calm moment where Nami's seeing if they're prepared for attackers, and the gun is never actually used. Very disappointing.
</li><li> There's an extended sequence throughout the thirteenth opening showing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luffy reuniting with Ace amidst the ruins of Marineford</span>. Not very likely given that arc in the manga has already ended with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Marineford left intact and Ace dead shortly after being released</span>.
</li><li> In the 17th opening <em>Wake Up</em>, it showcases Luffy, Zoro and Sanji going up against the Admirals <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> which includes newcomer Issho</span> as well as Luffy vs Blackbeard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> No, this doesn't happen in the manga. In fact both Akainu and Blackbeard haven't even been revealed yet in the current timeline when this was aired.</span>
</li><li> The 19th opening features Luffy, Zoro and Sanji in skirmishes against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jack and Kaido</span>; the former is never really fought directly by any of the Straw Hats while the latter is not even physically present during the arc.
</li><li> The 18th, 20th and 21st all have variations of this as they showcase scenes of all the Straw Hats fighting together <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">despite the crew being split in half during those arcs. Only Luffy and four specific Straw Hats are present during the Dressrosa arc in the 18th opening, while openings 20 and 21 features Luffy again, but with the other four that weren't at Dressrosa.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ParanoiaAgent">Paranoia Agent</a></em> consists of brightly lit shots of most of the ensemble cast laughing insanely as they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoFourthWall">look directly at the "camera"</a>, and even as things like mushroom clouds (in direct defiance of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearWeaponsTaboo">Nuclear Weapons Taboo</a>) appear in the background. Throughout the series, said characters rarely if ever smile, much less <em>laugh</em>, and the song that plays over the credits is also loud, tribal, and cheerful, albeit with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricalDissonance">lyrics that mix cheerful and apocalyptic themes</a> — the combination is surreal and twisted, more so once you've seen enough of the series to realize just how <em>wrong</em> it really is.
<ul><li> According to an interview with the director, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiKon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SatoshiKon">Satoshi Kon</a>, the tone of the opening theme was because the show was to appear on an unusually late time slot. He wanted a theme that was loud and bombastic so that it would wake the viewers' brains up a little bit.
</li></ul></li><li> Done with the second opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhantomOfInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhantomOfInferno">Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom</a></em>. While the 1st opening is <em>not</em> one of these as it was very dark and melodic fitting the tone of the series, the second one is a huge contrast and gives the series a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> appearance, showing Reiji and Eren happily living their day to day life in Japan and hanging out with friends while Drei, a violent girl with a death wish in the series, is shown being happy and carefree in the opening.
</li><li> The first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> opening featured a Blastoise, Venusaur, and Charizard...of which only the latter was ever acquired by Ash, and shows him using a Pidgeot, which didn't happen until near the ending of the season. It also features several legendary Pokémon that he either never sees, or ends up seeing them in completely different seasons.
<ul><li> Heck, Ash didn't even acquire Pidgeot until the episode the opening changed in Japan.
</li><li> A worse offender is the tenth opening, which starts off with a group shot of just about every Pokémon Ash has ever owned — more than half of which don't appear again in the show. It goes on to show a series of battles of which only one (Pikachu vs. Aipom) actually happen in the show. This all makes sense when you realize it was made to celebrate the franchise's 10th anniversary.
</li><li> The Black and White opening during the Team Plasma season makes it look like Charizard would have a lot of focus, and that Reshiram will fight Charizard and partner with N as it did in the game. The actual events of the show have Charizard in a supporting role, Ash using Pikachu to fight Reshiram, and only to snap it out of Ghetsis's brainwashing.
<ul><li> The same opening also depicts a battle between Ash and Cheren (who is already a gym leader by that point) against an epic, church-like background, making it seem important. While the battle does happen, it takes place on a generic schoolground battlefield, is kinda anti-climactic and has literally zero impact to the story.
</li></ul></li><li> The English theme for the Advance Battle season is called "Unbeatable" and seems to proclaim Ash as someone who has never lost. Not only is this untrue- he lost plenty of times before- but this season also was the season with the Hoenn Leauge, which he also lost.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/IL3uT44NgMQ">The first opening<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HappinessChargePrettyCure">Happiness Charge Pretty Cure</a></em> has Iona acting friendly with the other cures... but all that did was hide how much of a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> she was for the first half of the season, completely antagonizing Hime while treating Megumi and Yuko as tools.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Pretty Sammy</a></em> makes the show look like a fairly standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch">Cute Witch</a> style of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> show, with Sasami actually appearing happy about her powers and Misao being in on the secret. Then you get to the actual show, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlWarrior">Magical Girl Warrior</a> show with Sasami not caring for her role and Misao most definitely not in on the secret. Since the show is meant as a parody of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> genre, this was intentional.
</li><li> The second opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PsychoPass">Psycho-Pass</a></em> season 1 has Kougami, sitting on the floor and surrounded by bodies of his teammates which most viewers expect that this is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi">Gen "Urobutcher"' Urobuchi</a> is going to do. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end of season 1, only two were dead and one of them was disintegrated by Destroy Decomposer mode leaving no trace of his body</span>. And there's the beginning of the opening where Kougami is wounded and sitting against the wall which doesn't happened in the show proper.
<ul><li> The second season's opening shows a showdown between Akane and Mika with Kougami, being tied up to a chair. That never happened in the show and Kougami wasn't physically present since he's in Cambodia as seen in the movie.

The opening? Standard cute <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> song, images (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">references</a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, CCS, and even Pretty Cure), the works. The problem? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GenUrobuchi">Gen Urobuchi</a> is writing — The series is a rather savage deconstruction. The monsters aren't harmless, people can (and do) die, the aspects of a bunch of young girls fighting horrific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abominations</a> are fully explored... and oh yeah, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the cute mascot appears to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">faustian</a></span>. Notably, the first two episodes didn't have an ending sequence (they do have one on DVD, but it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TastesLikeDiabetes">Tastes Like Diabetes</a>), episode 3 was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhamEpisode">Wham Episode</a> and is officially horrifying from the climax on, culminating in the main character floating <em>in the mask of Mephistopheles</em> during the ending sequence (which is not remotely a standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> song).

<ul><li> By the time the series ends (and the viewers know what's really going on), it becomes obvious that it's a subverted trope. It's especially obvious each time the OP gets shifted to the end of the episode; it's the exact same song, but because of the episode we just saw, a new meaning is revealed.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note26b0n');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note26b0n" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note26b0n');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Yes, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwelveEpisodeAnime">12-Episode Anime</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed with the opening to the original 1990 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RecordOfLodossWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RecordOfLodossWar">Record of Lodoss War</a></em>, which makes the series look purely like a sappy fairy tale love story. While there is a romantic subplot, the series is an action oriented work of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy">High Fantasy</a> first and foremost, with the romance elements only vaguely hinted at until Parn <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">finally got the hint</a> during the final few episodes, and even then isn't as prominent as the OP would have you believe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RedGarden">Red Garden</a></em> has an opening that would make you think it's basically the anime Sex and the City. The show's content goes in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">different direction</a> however. The ending falls under this as well; it's an upbeat rap song with the characters having fun at a concert.
</li><li> The opening sequence for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> shows Utena and Anthy in dark blue and red plate armor, respectively, riding flying horses in an implied battle against an unseen enemy. Needless to say, we never see anything like this in the series. This was a result of changes to the author's original storyline rather than deliberate deception, not that someone watching the finished product has any way to tell the difference. Director Ikuhara later joked it was a scene he had thought up during his work on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> and that it wouldn't make any sense <em>there</em> either.

<ul><li> ...It kind of <em>was</em>.
</li><li> Don't forget — the opening only shows Sanosuke with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Zanbatou</a>, even in the final crowd shot. He loses the Zanbatou more or less one episode after his introduction, and fights with his fists from then on. Similarly, the opening shows Kenshin fighting... chain-wielding... farmers?

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt. Frog</a></em> plays with this in episode 150. After spending the entire episode getting ready to leave (he'd been promoted), Giroro gives a heartfelt (for him) goodbye at the train station. Cue a special ending sequence, complete with sad music and a "Goodbye Giroro" card... only for Giroro to literally shoot through them and grab Keroro by the neck. That promotion letter? Turns out it was a month old. Cue the regular ending sequence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ShakuganNoShana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ShakuganNoShana">Shakugan no Shana</a></em> pulled this off with its second opening, which contains a one-on-one duel between Shana and Sydonay that never actually happens.
</li><li> The opening of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShamanicPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ShamanicPrincess">Shamanic Princess</a></em> OVA is standard, pastel-toned romance fanfare. The series itself is a dark tale of a powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteWitch">Cute Witch</a> and her rivals as they search for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a holy item from their world, which turns out to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> holding the sister of the protagonist's former love interest.</span>
</li><li> The OP for the <em>Shin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em> OAV features two girls alongside the guys: Tsubasa's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> Sanae and Misaki's female friend (and Sanae's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">expy</a>) Azumi. Azumi was actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a>, and only Sanae shows up in the story proper.
</li><li> Some shots in the opening of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GetterRobo">Shin Getter Robo vs Neo Getter Robo</a></em> OVA series suggest that it will live up to its title and the two Getters will fight each other, or at least side-by-side, at some point. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">No such luck</a>, unfortunately.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SkyGirls">Sky Girls</a></em> opening is a bit of a lie in two ways: first, it suggests an action story, while the series is mostly a slice-of-life story (with some action, but not as much as suggested); second, it features a monster that's never battled (mostly because the footage is from the Sky Girls OVA, which follows a different storyline).
</li><li> The third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> opening (<em>Slayers TRY</em>) has a humorous shot of Lina's sister, Luna, with a sign pointing at her reading, "sorry, opening only!" As for the song itself, it is less energetic and more mellow than the previous two openings, citing for a darker story, but while the overarching plot darkens later on, the overall tone of the show is as comedic as it had always been, creating some poorly timed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">Mood Whiplash</a> during the comedic filler episodes. Also, in that opening, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Filia</a> is portrayed as some demure <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousWaif">prophetic waif</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistressedDamsel">Distressed Damsel</a>, but in the show proper, she's an obnoxious, prissy, and loud (and very dead-on) variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HolierThanThou">Holier Than Thou</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> is guilty of this. The second opening shows Super Sonic and Super Shadow fighting. They do fight midway into the Metarex saga, but it's nowhere near as spectacular.
<ul><li> Also, though Shadow is featured decently prominently in the first opening, he doesn't even appear until after the second opening has appeared. This is because the first opening is almost entirely recycled footage from the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wy_XroBwyyE">2001 pilot<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which summarizes the plot for the show as a whole.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, the second opening, Papermoon, starts out pretty basic... with just a bunch of pictures of the characters flashing across the screen in rapid succession. Until the very last shot, when we see Soul crying in anguish, holding an unconscious Maka in his arms. This never happens. If anything, it's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Soul's near-death in the final episode that fuels Maka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>. The one that reveals that she is a weapon</span>.
<ul><li> Although, Studio Bones had some hints as to what was going to happen in the manga before it came out, as a bit of an assistant for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeckoEnding">Gecko Ending</a> they created. Kid's stripes, Black Star's conversations with the Will of Nakatsukasa, and Rachel Boyd's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">return to health</span> make an appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpiderRiders">Spider Riders</a></em> shows a fight between Hunter and Magma on the first opening. The two never fight each other during the course of the series, not even as friendly sparring. Also, the 3rd ending inexplicably shows what appears to be blood coming from Aqune's mask.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsOriginalGeneration">Super Robot Wars Original Generation</a>: Divine Wars</em> shows Latooni battling in her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElegantGothicLolita">Elegant Gothic Lolita</a> outfit. She only uses that outfit for two episodes (and only one battle) and most of the time is given a regular uniform and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">glasses</a>.
<ul><li> This is a shout-out to the original game series, where Latooni in fact wears said outfit the entire second game. Of course, in the remake that the TV show borrows from or vice versa, she always wears a normal uniform.
</li></ul></li><li> Given the amount of stuff that has actually come to pass from it, the opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/HaruhiSuzumiya">Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu</a></em> is probably an exception. What were originally simply random, half-second images took on new meaning the further we got through the story; furthermore, a few clips are direct from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovel">Light Novels</a> or interpretations of what happens on drama CDs. Maybe the entire thing is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">Spoiler Opening</a>...
</li><li> In the (rather lovely) opening sequence of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SweetBlueFlowers">Sweet Blue Flowers</a></em>, Fumi and Akira are depicted as a cheery, loving couple, complete with full nudity. Sure, the girls are extremely close, but never get this far in the series. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the anime at least. The manga has them undergoing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade">Relationship Upgrade</a> eventually.</span>
</li><li> Ran and Midori from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TelepathyShoujoRan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TelepathyShoujoRan">Telepathy Shoujo Ran</a></em> never fly around in the series as they do in the opening credits. Bummer.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TentaiSenshiSunred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TentaiSenshiSunred">Tentai Senshi Sunred</a></em> depicts Sunred with all the typical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tokusatsu">tokusatsu</a> hero tropes. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence">Transformation Sequence</a>, stylized weapons, a bike and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a>. None of these have appeared outside the credits.
</li><li> Both of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTowerOfDruaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheTowerOfDruaga">The Tower of Druaga</a></em>'s opening credit sequences seem to suggest some sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> show about school children, with subtle references to what actually happens in the show and most of the characters cleverly hidden in plain sight. The only things in the credits for <em>The Aegis of Uruk</em> that are at all reliable are the character pairings and various posters in the background, which show the truth of the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em>: The ending credits hint at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a romance between Abel and Esther, which never happens</span>. Also, the opening credits seem to give the Crusnik way more screen time than he gets in most episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwinSignal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TwinSignal">Twin Signal</a></em>'s <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hjIORoPahA">opening<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows scenes of a futuristic city, with the title character battling a slew of super-powered robots, running from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a>, and several unusual characters including what appears to be a fairy. The actual OVA is set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingExcitingEverHappensHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingExcitingEverHappensHere">sleepy town in the countryside</a>, is comedy-oriented, and about half the characters in the intro don't even <em>appear</em> in the show proper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UtaKata">Uta Kata</a></em>'s opening suggest the series is a fluffy shoujo story. It's a seinen series, and things get <em>very</em> dark later as mature issues are explored in detail.
<ul><li> As a bonus, Ichika's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> costume in the opening does not appear in the show at all. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Actually, it does, kinda...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> it to black, and it's her twelth and final transformation's costume.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Vandread">Vandread</a></em>'s first ending shows Meia being incredibly affectionate the main character, Hibiki. In the show proper, not only does it take a while for her to warm up to Hibiki, she treats him more like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Bud</a> than an object her affection. In fact out of the three main girls, her relationship with him is the most platonic.
</li><li> The opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus">Venus Versus Virus</a></em> present the two female leads Lucia and Sumire lying in a field wearing pretty dresses, their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntertwinedFingers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntertwinedFingers">fingers intertwined</a> as they throw meaningful glances. It's very sweet and romantic — and also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaitAndSwitchLesbians">occurs nowhere in the anime itself</a>. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxSymbolism">symbolic</a>.
</li><li> The intro to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> literally reveals nothing about the show, except maybe that it's school related. Not a single human appears in it. It just shows off the school.
</li><li> Played for laughs with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NoMatterHowILookAtItItsYouGuysFaultImNotPopular">No Matter How I Look at It, It's You Guys' Fault I'm Not Popular!</a></em>. It has a very hard rock intro with visuals that make it seem like an action or horror anime. It's really a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CringeComedy">Cringe Comedy</a> filled anime about a very awkward high school girl who wants to be popular.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WashioSumiIsAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/WashioSumiIsAHero">Washio Sumi Is A Hero</a></em> has a bright, cheery intro about friendship. This fits the first three episodes, as the show begins lighthearted despite the girls ending up bloody after each battle, but stops being accurate after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gin dies</span>. The latter half of the series isn't so cheery.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WitchHunterRobin">Witch Hunter Robin</a></em>'s opening made it look like Robin had a crush on Amon but no such relationship ever materialized.
<ul><li> There was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">Unresolved Sexual Tension</a> there. Not much, what with here being really young (15?), but there was definitely subtext.
</li><li> The intro in general makes Robin seem like a depressed person in total despair, and the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raSnXXBtCbc">lyrics to the opening song<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> support this, but nothing in Robin's backstory is ever revealed to be anything close to this and she seems to always have at least one person she can rely on throughout the show.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WelcomeToTheNHK">Welcome to the N.H.K.</a></em> features a cheery sounding duet for the theme, with pastel-colored, brightly lit scenes of cute girls frolicking, which gives the impression of a lighthearted romantic comedy of some sort. The series is actually about a young man with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hikikomori">extreme social anxiety</a> struggling to deal with his psychological issues and addictions, being helped by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlitheSpirit">Blithe Spirit</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that's actually as screwed up mentally as he is</span>. There <em>are</em> some hints of the darker, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">Black Comedy</a> tone of the show in the opening—the few times the main character is shown he's almost always shown having some sort of panic attack, the main heroine is shown looking lonely as she leans against a wall, and the other women in the opening are faceless (a probable nod to the issues the main character and his friend have with women)—but it still seems a little too upbeat.
</li><li> Perhaps not a bait and switch as such, but the opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WolfsRain">Wolf's Rain</a></em> place the characters in a modern (Japanese?) city that doesn't appear in the series <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Until the end of Episode 30, after the world has been destroyed and reborn.</span> Furthermore, the credits show actual rainfall — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">something that also doesn't happen until Episode 30, where it allows the lunar flowers to germinate and regenerate life on Earth</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first, fourth and fifth openings show Yugi and his friends prominently in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolUniformsAreTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolUniformsAreTheNewBlack">school uniforms</a>, despite Yugi is the only character who wears his uniform everywhere. The other characters wear their school uniforms... only in school. Also, the third and fourth opening have Yami Yugi wearing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoatCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoatCape">Coat Cape</a>, despite he doesn't wear it in the Battle City Finals and in the fourth season. The only times he wears it after the time of the second opening is in a hallucination of Jonouchi and after the end of the Battle City Tournament, when he and Jonouchi have their decisive duel.
</li><li> The second opening has Yami Yugi fighting against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FacelessGoons">Faceless Goons</a> wielding an army of monsters, who at one point summon a monster that never appears in the series at all — namely, Nuvia the Wicked, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptedOut">Adapted Out</a> between the manga and anime. On top of that, Nuvia is recolored to look like Worm Drake, who <em>did</em> appear.
</li><li> The third opening shows Yami Yugi dueling Marik on the Battle Ship (a zeppelin). However, Marik never duels personally in the series at all; he's eventually replaced by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Superpowered Evil Side</a> who duels our protagonist on top of the Alcatraz Tower.
</li><li> The fifth opening shows The Winged Dragon of Ra without teeth. While Ra's Ancient Egypt version has no teeth in the manga, in the anime it does have them. The fifth opening in general is much more inspired by the manga's take on the arc than the one that actually aired — the anime added in diadhanks, which are completely absent in the opening, and Yugi and his friends are in their school uniforms, which is the case in the manga but not the anime.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em>:
<ul><li> The fourth opening prominently features Judai's Card Ejecter, despite she never appears in the fourth season. Card Ejecter is only played once, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle">Final Battle</a> of the third season, but her effect is interrupted. This card is not even neither one of Judai's signature cards nor a Duel Spirit. Some viewers would think that Judai got this card in the fourth season.
</li><li> The third opening of the English dub shows a mirrored shot of Amon Garam/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange">Adrian Gecko</a>, implying that he's left-handed. He's not.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first version of the second opening shows Yusei Tribute Summoning Turret Warrior by tributing Junk Warrior during his Riding Duel with Kiryu. While Yusei does this against Dick Pitt, he never uses Turret Warrior against Kiryu in the anime. In the second version of opening 2, we see Jack facing off against Carly as a Dark Signer in a ground duel, whilst the episode they duel in is a Riding Duel. The second version also shows Road Warrior fighting Earthbound Immortal Uru, but during Yusei's first duel with Rudger, Road Warrior is already in the graveyard when Uru is summoned. The second version appears after the first duel with Rudger, but it shows them dueling outside despite their second duel is inside the building with the Old Momentum. And Road Warrior is not used in the rematch either.
</li><li> Road Warrior appears in the third and fifth opening as one of Yusei's prominent Synchro Monsters, even though he never uses him during the entire run of both openings when they are aired. Road Warrior appears only twice in the anime.
</li><li> Nitro Synchron appears in the third opening, but Yusei never uses it since the beginning of the Dark Signer arc, which was already over when the third opening started.
</li><li> Junk Destroyer appears in the fifth opening along with Yusei's four Synchro Warriors, despite Yusei never plays him during the time the opening is aired, like Road Warrior above.
</li><li> The fourth opening and fourth ending shows Life Stream Dragon, but it never appears during the run of these themes. However, it's subverted later as it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">Spoiler Opening</a> for the last arc.
</li><li> In the fifth opening, the very end shows Yusei using Junk Warrior to attack Z-ONE. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Junk Warrior is never used in that duel, but he pops up in 154 to deal the finishing blow to Jack.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZEXAL">Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first opening theme features Fuya Okudaira (aka Robin) in the same sections as Yuma's main rivals. He continues to make appearances in the opening and ending themes due to the character's popularity, but rarely actually shows up.
</li><li> The opening and ending themes prominently feature Anna Kozuki as if she is a main cast member. She appears in only eight episodes, with two of those only being cameos. Overall, she tends to appear once or twice an arc.
</li><li> The first opening shows Number 39: Utopia ("King of Wishes, Hope") fighting Number 17: Leviathan Dragon ("Levice Dragon"), indicating that they are rivals, since Yuma and Shark are rivals as well. However, since Yuma wins this card in episode 2, the scene has become ironic.
</li><li> The fifth opening shows Shark using Number 32: Shark Drake and Number C32: Shark Drake Veiss, despite he never uses either of them during the entire run of this opening.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first opening shows Sawatari holding his three Darts Shooting cards. However, since he replaces them for another deck in episode 7, three episodes after they are revealed in the opening, they have become meaningless.
</li><li> The second opening shows participants of the Junior Youth Championship in a prominent way, these includes the students from the various Duel Schools and the LDS trio. None of them is actually important to the tournament plot and they are eliminated pretty early, most of them off-screen or very quick. Particularly, the LDS trio, who are supporting characters, are highlighted with the rest of the supporting cast, but all of them besides Masumi, who was eliminated before the opening was first aired, suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a> and they have lost their prominence in the show. Sora is also shown to among the ranks of LDS, which might foreshadow that he will eventually leaves You Show, but Sora never joins LDS and even antagonizes them.
</li><li> The third opening depicts a vicious battle between an angry Yuya and Yugo, using Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon and Clear Wing Synchro Dragon, respectively. Presumably, it was setting up a war between them, as Yuya is on a mission to rescue Yuzu, who Yugo accidentally whisked away. In the show proper, not only does Yuya not use Odd-Eyes Rebellion in the Synchro Dimension during the span the show used this opening, but he and Yugo never duel. Their only meeting came at the end of episode 91, and they never spoke - they just dueled their opponents in the same room. What's more, neither of the two bear any ill will towards each other; in fact, Yugo seems to think Yuya's a pretty cool guy if Yuzu thinks so highly of him. Furthermore, Odd-Eyes Rebellion normally doesn't attack with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreathWeapon">Breath Weapon</a> and has only done that in the final episode of the series.
</li><li> The fourth opening features Yuya's rematch with Jack Atlas. Odd-Eyes Rebellion Dragon is fighting Red Daemon's Dragon Scarlight in the opening, but Yuya does not summon it during the rematch.
</li><li> The sixth opening is positive and upbeat, and depicts our protagonist performing and bringing smiles to an audience full of his friends. Some of the lyrics are about making people smile and following your dreams. While the show uses this opening, the Lancers become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DwindlingParty">Dwindling Party</a>, Yuya fails to reach his goal of saving Yuzu and the other bracelet girls, suffers from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">Sanity Slippage</a> multiple times, and eventually gets possessed and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">turns evil, becoming Zarc and bent on killing all those people Yuya was making smile in the opening</span>. It also prominently features Odd-Eyes Raging Dragon being the center of Yuya's entertainment, despite Yuya never summons Odd-Eyes Raging in his non-awakened state, and the series implies that Odd-Eyes Raging is actually the most evil one of all the hybrids.
</li></ul></li><li> The third ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> has Noelle, Mimosa and Kanoho dressed as schoolgirls in an ending that makes it seem like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> or Shoujo.
<ul><li> The fourth ending focuses almost entirely on Noelle, even though she's not the most important character of that particular arc.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em> portrays Saitama as some kind of badass, tough-as-nails action hero when he's actually just a hero for fun and so overpowered that he can defeat any enemy with one punch and therefore never has to actually fight anybody. This is lampshaded by the ending, which switches Saitama's appearance from the hard look of the rest of the theme to his usual appearance.

<div class="indent"><strong>Lemony Snicket:</strong> I'm sorry to say that this is <em>not</em> the movie you will be watching. The movie you are about to see is extremely unpleasant. If you wish to see a film about a happy little elf, then I'm sure there is still plenty of seating in theatre number two. However, if you like stories about clever and reasonably attractive orphans, suspicious fires, carnivorous leeches, Italian food and secret organizations, then stay, as I retrace each and every one of the Baudelaire children's woeful steps. My name is Lemony Snicket, and it is my sad duty to document this tale.
</div><ul><li> Of course, this is a hilarious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythologyGag">Mythology Gag</a> for the people who have read the books.
</li><li> <em>The Littlest Elf</em> itself exists in the movie universe, though, since Sunny is seen using an elf bobblehead's head as part of an improvised lever to pull a track switch, and the song in the fake-out opening is heard on a tapedeck in Count Olaf's car.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">Invoked</a> for humorous effect by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHeadDoAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHeadDoAmerica">Beavis and Butt-Head Do America</a></em>, which leads with the main characters in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuddyCopShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuddyCopShow">'70s-style cop show</a> opening, complete with a theme song in the mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shaft">Shaft</a></em> and performed by none other than Isaac Hayes himself. As one might have guessed, the protagonists spend little of the remainder of the film <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">blowing stuff up</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicBattleBoredom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicBattleBoredom">kicking ass</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForSex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestForSex">scoring</a>, though certainly not for lack of trying.
<ul><li> The joke is capitalized on right away by cutting from the explosion that ends the opening credits to Beavis and Butt-head poking around in the trash, looking for their TV.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening credits for the (non)hit b-movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaveDwellers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaveDwellers">Cave Dwellers</a></em>. Two men in loincloths run around the screen doing weird things — you never see the men in the opening credits during the movie, nor do you see any action sequence similar to what they were doing. This is because the clips are from the 1963 Italian sword-and-sandal film <em>Taur, the Mighty</em>. When Film Ventures International purchased what became <em>Cave Dwellers</em> for a 1990 re-release, they couldn't use the original credits or film title (<em>Blade Master</em>); this allowed them to license the remainder of the movie as a film clip.
</li><li> There are a few of these in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MysteryScienceTheater3000">MST3K</a></em> canon — the calling card of Film Ventures International, all "featuring" music by Karl Demer — including <em>Master Ninja I</em> and <em>II</em>, <em>Stranded in Space</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PodPeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PodPeople">Pod People</a></em>, and <em>Space Travelers</em>. The FVI credits footage for <em>Pod People</em> and <em>Stranded in Space</em> are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> in how not from the repackaged film they are (<em>Pod People</em> takes its opening credits footage from the 1985 film <em>Galaxy Invader</em>; the source for the <em>Stranded in Space</em> credit footage is the 1983 film <em>Prisoners of the Lost Universe</em>). The <em>Master Ninja</em> credits are actually fairly representative of the "movies" themselves — Lee Van Cleef somewhat half-assedly pretending to be a ninja. It's the score and film-negative effect that make them stand out....
</li><li> The beginning of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheKillerTomatoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheKillerTomatoes">Return of the Killer Tomatoes!</a></em> shows a group of attractive teenager girls in skimpy bathing suits romping on a beach, with a voiceover announcing "You are about to see the movie <em>Big Breasted Women Go To The Beach And Take Their Tops Off</em>" (complete with a Beach Boys-style theme song containing those words), until the screen goes black, the voiceover apologizes for showing the wrong movie, and the title for "Return of the Killer Tomatoes" appears.
<ul><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">brought back</a> at the very end of the movie, after the denouement. During the course of the movie it's explained that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a>'s machinery can turn tomatoes into beautiful young women, and the final scene features one of the secondary characters taking them all to the beach, whereupon the footage plays again — only now, it (properly) refers to them as "Big-Breasted <em>Tomatoes</em>".
</li></ul></li><li> Minor example: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostShip">Ghost Ship</a></em> starts with cheesy lounge music and the title in a cheerfully 1950s-style font, and zooms in on the ship's passengers happily dancing the night away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and then a tightly wound wire slices through the crowd</span>.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSWINQ32Ozw">opening credits<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlob1958" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlob1958">The Blob (1958)</a></em> written by none other than Burt Bacharach (no, I'm not kidding) sound like a fun, beach-rompy movie (lyrics notwithstanding).
</li><li> Taken to the logical extreme with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TropicThunder">Tropic Thunder</a></em>, which opens with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTrailerFakeMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTrailerFakeMovie">fake trailers and commercials</a> starring almost all of the lead "actors" of the film-within-a-film. The parodies are so spot on that some in the audience thought the previews were still running.
</li><li> The opening song to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a></em> promises that we will "see androids fighting Brad and Janet". There's nothing in the film that could be described as an android except just possibly Rocky, who never touches Brad, and what he does to Janet is... not called fighting. Put a comma there and continue to pretend Rocky is an android and it <em>almost</em> works. We see at least one "android" fighting, and we see Brad and Janet. This is one hell of a stretch, admittedly.
<ul><li> More a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune">Thematic Theme Tune</a>, since the lyrics are actually about Science Fiction B-movies in general.
<ul><li> And it's done for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LyricSwap">Lyric Swap</a> version of <em>Science Fiction - Double Feature Reprise</em> that summarizes the events of the movie, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">most prints</a> end with replaying <em>The Time Warp</em> instead. The Brad and Janet line in that version goes "Darkness has conquered/Brad and Janet".
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Peter Weir's first feature <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCarsThatAteParis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCarsThatAteParis">The Cars That Ate Paris</a></em> opens with what appears to be a cigarette ad featuring a couple taking an idyllic country drive. Then things go horribly wrong. The sequence is part of the film narrative (though stylistically distinct) but the original cinema audience wouldn't have realised it until the very effective 'punchline'.
</li><li> The opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daisies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Daisies">Daisies</a></em> have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryGorn">Scenery Gorn</a> montage, which eventually cuts to two bored girls in bikini. However, the girls' complaint about how the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">has gone bad</a> toes directly to the previous montage and their consequent actions are what drives the (un)plot.
</li><li> The live-action <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> movie starts out like one of his old cartoon opening, then, where the title of the short is, Popeye sticks his head up and says, "Hey, what's this? One of Bluto's tricks? I'm in the wrong movie!" and we enter live-action.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrMagoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MrMagoo">Mr. Magoo</a></em> film, which is live-action, starts out with an animated Magoo, going through his usual near-sighted hijinks before we enter the main plot and live-action.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em>
<ul><li> Some editions of start out with several minutes of the 1961 film <em>Dentist on the Job</em> (starring a young Bob Monkhouse). This goes on far longer than most credit gags, to the point where one wonders if there was some bizarre mix-up before the projectionist sleepily grumbles about having put in the wrong reel and the credits proper start up. (This gag was carried over from the original cinema release.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithSubtitles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithSubtitles">The opening credits of the film proper feature pseudo-Swedish subtitles and references to things that have nothing to do with the movie.</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3cien');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3cien" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3cien');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mynd you, møøse bites Kan be pretty nasti...</span>
</li><li> The opening credits are actually the full credits, run at the beginning to set up an elaborate joke on the viewing audience. At the intermission (which is actually 90% of the way through the movie), music begins playing and goes on just long enough for viewers to think it's a real intermission and get up, only to have the movie abruptly reappear, forcing them to return to their seats. At the end, a fourth wall break that's the result of the police arresting everyone causes the physical film to run out and be held over by the same intermission music (with no picture), but this time it runs for three minutes before the movie simply ends without credits, leading viewers to sit in their seats (having been tricked by the intermission) until it runs out and then be puzzled why there are no end credits. Especially as the ending is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">abrupt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">weird</a>.

It's inspired by the opening titles of many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterSellers">Peter Sellers</a>' actual films...but it's also light and funny to deliberately contrast with the mostly-miserable story of a mostly-miserable man that follows.

From season 3, this was replaced by guitar rock and visuals of the wacky things the Boys from the Dwarf went through.

<ul><li> One episode had the opening at the <em>very end</em> of the show, followed by <em>the credits</em>. Another ran the opening credits at the beginning of the show... followed <em>immediately</em> by the closing credits.
</li><li> Episode 25 begins with fake titles and credits for a historical epic called <em>The Black Eagle</em>, whose opening scene is interrupted by the <em>real</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleSequence">Title Sequence</a>. The scene nevertheless goes on for long enough that early audiences were probably scrambling for the week's <em>Radio Times</em>, wondering if there had been another last-minute schedule change.

</li><li> The opening of the recent Spike TV reality show <em>Murder</em> shows car chases, the host firing weapons, <em>CSI</em>-style graphics, and contestants observing what appear to be car explosions. The show is actually about contestants investigating realistic crime-scenes, and episodes mostly consist of people discussing the case in a conference room.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdOpening">Cold Opening</a> of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> episode "Death in Heaven", Clara Oswald, confronted by a Cyberman, claims that "Clara" never existed and she is in fact the Doctor. The credits then roll with Jenna Coleman given top billing and Coleman's eyes shown instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCapaldi">Peter Capaldi</a>'s, hinting that her words are true. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They aren't</span>.
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaulOfTheMoleMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaulOfTheMoleMen">Saul of the Mole Men</a></em> opens with the credits to <em>STRATA</em>, ostensibly a show about the adventures of intrepid underground explorers. Then within the first minute, nearly the entire "STRATA Action Team" is gruesomely killed, the only survivors being the Robot, Johnny Tambourine, and the titular Saul, a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">geologist</a> who didn't even merit a mention in the STRATA opening. (The actual opening is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune">Expository Theme Tune</a> that would spoil the plot of the first episode if it were run up front.)
</li><li> The show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrBean">Mr. Bean</a></em> uses this and then subverts it at the same time, by starting with a solemn choir...and then apparently, beaming down Mr. Bean, as if from space. He gets up and wanders off. Towards the end of the credits, he wanders back into the picture, then off again in the opposite direction as before.
<ul><li> Lampshaded and subverted by the animated version, in which Mr. Bean is taken aboard a flying saucer populated by Mr. Bean lookalikes — but of course just when he thinks he's found his place in the universe the aliens reject him and beam him down in an exact facsimile of the live-action opening credits.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OminousLatinChanting">solemn choir</a> isn't all that solemn either, if you translate it back from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousLatin">the Latin</a>. <em>Ecce homo, qui est faba</em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Behold the man, who is a bean.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WarOfTheWorlds1988">War of the Worlds (1988)</a></em> was basically a sci-fi paranoia thriller set in the 80's (and shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada). By the end, audiences were expecting more of the same thing for the next season. The second series then opened with a radio broadcast detailing how soldiers were rioting and shooting people (as a result of the paranoia?). Of course, once you watch the second season, you find out that the whole premise is a team of people living underground in a sewer system, and launching covert attacks against the aliens. There is no army to speak of. They're disregarded as an ally in the second episode.
</li><li> The opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MightyMorphinPowerRangers">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a></em> episode "The Mutiny" suggested Rita Repulsa would remain as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Then we got caught by surprise with the debut of Lord Zedd and that Rita was working for him all this time.
</li><li> The opening credits of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> premiere indicated Divatox would remain as the main villain, and didn't credit Andros. Sure, Astronema had already made an appearance in the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanColdOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanColdOpening">Batman Cold Opening</a> but nothing concrete to that point indicated she'd take over.
</li><li> The opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersLightspeedRescue">Power Rangers Lightspeed Rescue</a></em> indicated Vypra would be the main villain. But in reality, she wasn't.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersTimeForce">Power Rangers Time Force</a></em> was about time travelers from the future, and clips in later versions of the opening showed the characters in different eras like the Wild West, feudal Japan, or prehistoric times. The actual show, however, mostly took place in the present day (where the time travelers were stuck); with only the prehistory clip being from a legit time trip. The rest of the clips came from either <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger">Mirai Sentai Timeranger</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockFootage">Stock Footage</a>, which was never put into the American version, or from an episode where the characters were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInTVLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInTVLand">trapped in various movies</a> showing off different time periods. It's said that the producers originally wanted the series to contain several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> arcs. Unfortunately, all of the megazord fights in the 'Timeranger'' footage took place in modern Tokyo. With that in mind, the second opening was more like the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">they'd wished they'd could create had the footage cooperated</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderDenO">Kamen Rider Den-O</a></em> begins its opening sequence with the narration: "The time-traveling train, Denliner. Will its next stop be in the past or the future?" The answer to this question is ALWAYS "the past." At no point in the TV series does Denliner visit the future.
</li><li> The opening credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em> are an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of this trope. The viewer sees shots in extreme closeup which appear to be violent and bloody <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> amusing and wrong because Dexter is a methodical serial killer</span>... but turn out to be Dexter only going through his morning routine and having his breakfast.
</li><li> The credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuincyME" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuincyME">Quincy, M.E.</a></em>. You see the main character (a forensic pathologist) examining what you think is a dead body, but it turns out to be a young woman in a bikini with whom he his sharing drinks on his houseboat. These credits became even more of a B&amp;S after the character evolved as a more of an "everyman" type rather than a playboy, and it became even weirder when he got married.
</li><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllyMcBeal">Ally McBeal</a></em> promised a smiling and happy woman most of the time. However, during the episodes she was depressed/sad/angry nearly the whole series and only rarely seen in a happy mood.
</li><li> It was one of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s long standing dreams to give an actor initial credit and then kill him, or in this case her, off in that episode. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amber Benson</span> is credited for the first and last time in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><strong>Seeing Red</strong></span> and at the episode's end rather unceremoniously killed - <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by a stray bullet no less</span>.
<ul><li> Joss wanted to do this for the pilot with Jessie but it was shot down.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouCantDoThatOnTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YouCantDoThatOnTelevision">You Can't Do That on Television</a></em> episodes almost always started off with a title card for pre-empted shows that were cancelled, usually pop culture parodies related to the theme of the episode. For example, the episode, "Wildlife and Animals":
<dl><dd><div class="indent"> "'Wild Wild Kingdom' will not be seen at this time. In its place, we present a program in which people act like animals."
</div></dd></dl><ul><li> This concept was swiped wholesale from the first six seasons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>. ("'Charlie's Angels Get The Syph' will not be seen tonight...")
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyOneJumpStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyOneJumpStreet">21 Jump Street</a>: Peter DeLuise mentions in his commentary track for one of the episodes of the first season: the credits feature a bunch of gunplay and a car flipping over; however, the series mostly is about undercover work and centers around sedate dialog-driven scenes. The car flipping over was one of the most expensive scenes shot for the series, and was really the only one of its kind.
</li><li> The fifth season opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em> contains at least two things that appear to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">spoilers</a> but in context were misleading in a rather ironic fashion: various newspaper covers mentioning a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> of the homeless with a possible sexual motive <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which McNulty and Freamon made up to get the Police department more funding</span>, and a picture of McNulty laid out as if it were part of a wake <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which was really just a mock-wake held as a send-off before he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">taken off active police work</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a></em> pulls a fast one on viewers in its first episode. The opening credits to the pilot includes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Indira Varma, who plays Suzie Costello</span>. This was done to make it look like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was a regular cast member. She wasn't, and her character was dead by the end of the episode</span>.
</li><li> BBC children's comedy series <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OutOfTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OutOfTune">Out Of Tune</a></em>, which opened with a title card showing the church in the background, and accompanied by some beautiful choir singing, suddenly transitions mid-music into off-key wailing. The on-screen title begins to collapse as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KenanAndKel">Kenan &amp; Kel</a></em> features the titular characters in Los Angeles with Coolio (who performs the opening theme) essentially partying at night outdoors. Nothing like this ever happens in the show (most of it takes place indoors). None of the other characters besides those two appear in the opening either.
</li><li> The serious tone of the opening credits to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack"> Orange Is the New Black</a></em> prepare the viewer for a dramatic prison drama. While the series has plenty of dramatic moments, they are equalled or surpassed by more lighthearted moments.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TooManyCooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TooManyCooks">Too Many Cooks</a></em> takes this to an extreme, as the tone of the opening credits changes many times before the show even starts. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The show itself is only five seconds long.</span>
</li><li> If you're watching the DVD for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HouseOfCardsUS">House of Cards (US)</a></em> season 2, one of the things you'll see on the opening menu is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a full-screen shot of Zoe staring at the camera holding a microphone</span>, hinting that they'll have a big role in the upcoming season. That character, in fact, is dead by the end of the first episode.
</li><li> The opening credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Riget">Riget</a></em> make it look like a normal medical drama, although the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a> that precedes them has already revealed the true genre.
</li><li> The educational program <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DragonsWagonsAndWax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DragonsWagonsAndWax">Dragons, Wagons &amp; Wax</a></em> had an exciting, action-packed animated opening featuring a dragon who gets stuck on a runaway cart! The actual show was live-action, intellectual, slow-paced, and no Dragons. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYxLsEvQaFU">Watch here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UltramanAce">Ultraman Ace</a></em> features a lot of kaijuu from previous shows that never shows up in the show proper.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMarvelousMrsMaisel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMarvelousMrsMaisel">The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</a></em>: Season 2 episode 4, "We're Going to the Catskills!" opens with what seems to be a color recreation of the title sequence to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ToKillAMockingbird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ToKillAMockingbird">To Kill a Mockingbird</a></em>, even using the same music. It's only when we see a boy's hand pushing a U-Haul trailer, and Abe snatching said toy trailer away from Midge's son Ethan, that we remember which show we're in.

<ul><li> In the program for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Spamalot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Spamalot">Spamalot</a>.</em>
<ul><li> Playing off the "Fisch Schlapping Song" that starts the actual program, the main section of the playbill describes a Finnish moosical called <em>Dik Od Triaanenen Fol (Finns Ain't What They Used To Be)</em>, "the story, in music and song, of Finlands transformation from a predominantly rural agricultural base to one of the most sophisticated industrial and entrepreneurial economies in the world. Featuring the show-stopping, foot-stomping East Finland Moose Ballet  45 magnificent creatures in high-stepping harmony, believed to be the greatest display of horn ever seen on an American stage." Reading it will give you the impression you came to see something that is outright torture. With numbers like "Milk It", Its a Bleeding (Economic) Miracle!, I Hear Your Nokia But I Cant Come In and "Foek You, Farmers," <em>Dik Od Triaanenen Fol</em> is performed with three intermissions - one every <em>two and a half hours</em>. The real playbill information for <em>Spamalot</em> requires you to sift through these five pages first.
</li><li> <em>Patrons are asked not to smoke or speak Swedish in the theatre. Please use cell phones whenever possible.</em>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder6');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder6" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> During its title sequence, the Japanese-humor-filled comedy adventure game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouchDetective" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TouchDetective">Touch Detective</a> 2 1/2</em> features music and scenes that imply that it's in the mold of serious detective anime. Fortunately, the prominently featured dancing mushroom and corn-husk-masked villain <em>should</em> keep anyone from being genuinely fooled.
<ul><li> The original game, <em>Touch Detective</em> had a very similar intro, except slightly more believable; then, of course, the dancing mushroom appeared.
</li></ul></li><li> The opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea3AbsenceOfJustice">Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice</a></em> shows Master Big Star as an antagonist working (or at least hanging out) with Salvatore. In the game itself Master Big Star is a good guy who has a war with Salvatore, and is one of the more saner members of the cast.
<ul><li> The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea4APromiseUnforgotten">Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten</a></em> is home to quite a few inconsistencies with the game proper, such as Fuka using guns despite having no aptitude for them and Flonne using an attack that doesnt exist in the game, but the biggest one is its depiction of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Axel</a>. Hes featured heavily alongside the main cast, giving the impression that hes a central protagonist. In the actual game, not only is he an antagonist for the majority of the main campaign, hes not even playable until the postgame.
</li></ul></li><li> At first, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TimeHollow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/TimeHollow">Time Hollow</a></em> seems like a story filled with the player spamming his ability to create time rifts, after it shows multiple prominent plot points in the character introduction part of the intro, as well as some parts of the story nicely animated. Your character cannot stop things already in motion in-game (like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the treehouse once it's already on fire — the player needs to stop the firebomb from burning the tree in the first place</span>), and we never get to see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ethan diving and catching Kori, or Ethan saving the place his parents were trapped in from blowing up</span>. Instead, in the story, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the place blows up <em>anyway</em>, and it's actually Ethan's <em>uncle</em> who saves the girl from falling off the school building — and even then, they don't even manage to prevent <em>that</em> — instead, the uncle and the girl fall a few stories to the ground</span>. Also, there's even a direct contradiction in the opening to actual fact in-story — <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Hollow Pen user cannot go through a Hole without losing their ability to use the pen — or even see or hold said pen</span>.
<ul><li> This was simple necessity. For a point-and-click game, especially one with no running timer or similar restriction, showing what you actually need do would constitute a MASSIVE spoiler. Plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildArms">Wild ARMs</a></em> series seems to run on this trope. Every game has an animated sequence that plays when you continue from a save file featuring the characters of the game. Almost none of the things shown in those sequences actually happen in the games.
</li><li> Used and lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IWannaBeTheGuy">I Wanna Be the Guy</a></em>. The title screen features a scrolling story card and shows the game's items in a fashion taken directly from the first Legend of Zelda, complete with Link at the end. Link himself, however, is holding a card reading "Most of this shit does not appear in this game"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Eversion">Eversion</a></em> has an adorable, sugary-sweet title screen that's a tad misleading. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">quote</a> and warning do hint at what's to come, though.
</li><li> One particular scene in the opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierIrisEternalMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierIrisEternalMana">Atelier Iris: Eternal Mana</a></em> heavily implies that Norn is much more mysterious and important to the plot than she appears. Not so in the actual game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaysJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JaysJourney">Jay's Journey</a></em> starts with a scrolling crawl giving some backstory about a hero from a thousand years past defeating a demon... that, as the scroll eventually admits, has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the game, "but it's still a pretty cool story, don't you think?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> is guilty of this in a few videos. The most poignant would be the opening video of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenIII">Suikoden III</a></em>, which has, among other things, Geddoe slicing up some flying creatures from a cliff-side, and Hugo fighting against Hallec, an ally who joins him without any sort of fight in-game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">Warriors Orochi</a> 2</em> treats us with the opening consisting of Cao Pi, Date Masamune, Saika Magoichi and Tachibana Ginchiyo kicking the ass of Orochi army. Come to the game, however, you find out that Masamune still remains with Orochi, not even thinking about joining the heroes.
<ul><li> Bait and Switch Credits seem to be a staple of the <em>Warriors</em> series in general, as you never quite get to play out the scenarios depicted in the opening sequences. (At least the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarriorsOrochi">Warriors Orochi</a> opening was more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere">How We Got Here</a> prologue.)
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB_TXhfpQio">opening<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalEyes">Eternal Eyes</a></em>, in addition to prominently featuring Shillay (a character with maybe 5 minutes of screentime), also shows the main characters fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Vorless in a number of places that don't exist in the game, with strange <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a> skills, and what the heck is that glowing blue skull anyway?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpecOpsTheLine">Spec Ops: The Line</a></em> does this to an extensive degree.

<ul><li> The Volume 2 and 3 openings give the four main characters action-packed fight scenes against the four main villains of each volume, pairing each protagonist and a villain. Blake is paired with Roman in Volume 2 and Adam in Volume 3, reflecting her conflicts in the two volumes. Ruby and Cinder are paired together in both as symbolism of the leaders of the two groups while Yang is paired together with Mercury, which sets up their Volume 3 storyline. That leaves Weiss and Emerald; they end up having no direct conflict with each other in either volume, but are the left-over characters from both groups in the opening credit sequences.

While there is a battle in the sixth episode fairly close to the opening's in scale, the Holons don't get upgraded until the end of the seventh, which is the second-to-last episode of the season; to date the upgraded Holons have only been seen in battle against a small handful of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> and the season's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeavy">Heavy</a>.
</li><li> Also, while spoiling the second-episode twist that Sinclair will not become a Holon pilot as he's been advertised—the title sequence features only five Holons and excludes Sinclair from the shot of the pilots powering up—he is still featured prominently in the opening as if he will be a main character regardless, when in fact he appears only in the second episode <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">due to being revealed as an impostor and killed; the real Sinclair makes his first appearance in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">The Stinger</a> of the season</span>.

Its theme song promises much more fluid and action-oriented animation than can be seen in the actual show. The Burning Man appears as the song reaches its climax, giving the impression that he'll be a much more prominent villain than he actually is. And at once point in the theme, Girlchan is seen walking alongside some blond boy who never appears in the show, though maybe he would have had the show not been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanedSeries">orphaned</a> after three episodes.

<ul><li> The first season did follow a similar format to what the credits show (although instead of having them as "heroes", they were just... well, themselves), but it was quickly abandoned. They didn't change the credits simply because they worked within the logic of the show.

The show is exactly the same as before. The season 10 intro is a similar case.
</li><li> However, the season 9 intro, which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyAcidSequence">Disney Acid Sequence</a>, is a bit closer to what the show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">actually</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyFratboyHijinx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyFratboyHijinx">is</a>.
</li><li> Season 10 brought back emblishing only this time as with the teens depicted as thieves that manage to pull off a diamond heist and masquerade as the band for a strip bar. Though the ending shows cops closing in on the place.
</li><li> Season 11, the final season, depicts the teens in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Animesque">Animesque</a> style partying and once more kicking ass, with many callbacks to previous openings.

<ul><li> There is no way to tell if the supernatural menaces in the opening credits are real or not. Conversely, later incarnations of the show did include real supernatural elements.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em> cartoon's title sequence had epic action scenes and detailed Japanese-style animation. The actual cartoon was legitimately an action series, but had slightly less emphasis on the fight scenes and was visually more in line with traditional early-'90s American animation.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositoryThemeTune">Expository Theme Tune</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeOfTheJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeOfTheJungle">George of the Jungle</a></em> has the line "while Fella and Ursula stay in step", accompanied by Ursula splitting into two dancing look-alike women in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleSequence">Title Sequence</a>. Many viewers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mondegreen">misheard the line</a> as "Bella and Ursula" and wondered where the heck Bella got to. "Fella" was in fact George's pet name for Ursula, because he's just that dumb. This was even used in the live-action movie: he refers to her as a "funny-lookin' fella."
<ul><li> The movie does change the line in the theme tune, though, making the line all about Shep the elephant.
</li><li> Possibly as a nod to this, in one episode George hits his head walking out of his tree-house (he forgot that he and Ursula live in a tree), and subsequently addresses Ursula as "Fella". Other character: "Fella?!" Ursula: "George is a simple man." "Nearsighted, too."
</li><li> in the 2007 remake, a new character named Magnolia or Maggie for short is introduced and theme song is changed to "Maggie and Ursula stay in step"

<ul><li> The standard opening, used for all episodes but the last three, fits the <em>tone</em> of the show, but depicts many things which don't occur in the series itself. It shows, among other things, the twins and Stan looking at a large human-like right footprint embedded inside a gigantic left footprint, Dipper finding the skeleton of what seems to be a large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornedHumanoid">Horned Humanoid</a>, and a jar of eyeballs at the gift shop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFourthWallWillNotProtectYou">moving to look at the camera</a>; those shots are believable (and it's heavily implied that the series only shows a part of Dipper and Mabel's adventures), but those specific events don't occur in any episode.

</li><li> The alternate "Weirdmageddon" opening used for the multi-part finale does this deliberately, with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the opening starting off the same as the regular one, then quickly becoming grotesque, with Bill Cipher and his gang <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HostileShowTakeover">inserting themselves in the title sequence</a> and replacing the main characters.</span>

When shown on the series, the episode had scenes cut, including Ren realizing that he had been kissing Stimpy in his sleep and washing his mouth on the toilet afterwards — scenes that feature prominently in the opening. (The uncut cartoon eventually aired on Spike TV and was released on DVD.)
</li><li> The Japanese credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMen">X-Men</a></em> feature Cable as a member of the team, but on the show he was a guest character who only appeared in five or six episodes total. It also features a final shot of Cyclops angsting while Krakoa looms over him. Krakoa never appears ever. Not to mention the opening's inclusion of Magneto summoning the Brood out of the earth itself.
<ul><li> The Western opening for the show has Magneto leading a group to fight the X-Men which never happens in the show. Two of them (Warpath and Yuri Topolov) don't oppose the X-Men throughout the show.
<ul><li> Cable is nothing! The second opening features Iceman as a member of the team. Iceman only appears in one episode.

In the actual series, Captain K'nuckles is a lazy, shiftless, and greedy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist</a> who manipulates the eponymous Flapjack's idolization of him to further whatever ill-advised and self-serving plan he's currently trying to enact, while Bubbie is the perpetual voice of reason and resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a>. One popular fan interpretation for the art shift and the out-of-characterness is that the opening is showing the world from Flapjack's (rather skewed) way of seeing things.
</li><li> The first episode of <em>Back to the Sewer</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em>' seventh season, plays the intro for <em>Fast Forward</em>, the series' sixth. While it makes sense in context — the episode is a transitional one, taking the characters from one premise to the next, with the actual opening played in the end to reflect the change — the fact that both seasons feature different characters, settings, premise, and art style, and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FourKidsEntertainment">4Kids</a> had actually organized a contest to let the fans vote for the new theme song made the bait and switch <em>very</em> surprising — and disconcerting.
</li><li> The first season intro for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBackyardigans">The Backyardigans</a></em> teases Austin being in that season's cowboy western-themed episode and Tasha being in the respective pirate episode, but neither occurs. All of the show's other intros deliver on what they promise.
</li><li> The opening credits to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Itchy and Scratchy cartoons</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> promises that 'they fight and bite' over animation of the two hitting each other with weapons. In fact, in the vast majority of episodes, they don't <em>fight</em> at all: Scratchy is minding his own business when Itchy brutally attacks and kills him for no reason at all.
</li><li> The Japanese opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> barely features Lugnut while prominently showing minor characters Arcee and Ironhide apparently on Earth and fighting alongside our heroes - indeed, Arcee is shown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight">fighting Blackarachnia</a> underwater (which, it should be noted, she is physically incapable of doing in-universe, since she is part organic). It also shows various fight scenes around the world, when in fact all the scenes on Earth take place in an around Detroit. Despite all that, it's <em>still</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoilerOpening">full of spoilers</a> (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Longarm Prime,</span> anyone?).

</li><li> The opening credits for the short-lived cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AlvinAndTheChipmunks">Alvin and the Chipmunks Go To the Movies</a></em> contains footage from different episodes, each parodying a different movie, but also a brief clip parodying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>, starring Alvin as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Luke Skywalker</a>, Simon and Theodore as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">C-3PO and R2-D2, respectively</a>, and David Seville as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Darth Vader.</a> Unfortunately, the <em>Star Wars</em> parody was <em>never</em> made into an actual episode of that series. There's also Eleanor swimming away from a shark and being saved by Jeanette in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> parody that was never made either.
</li><li> According to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThematicThemeTune">Thematic Theme Tune</a>, the apples don't fall far from the tree (they certainly do in all but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongFamilyResemblance">shallowest sense</a>). Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleMontage">Title Montage</a> essentially gives a visual equivalent of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuoteMine">Quote Mine</a> for PJ, who looks cheerful and safe in every single shot he appears in (except for one where he's making a face along with Max and Pistol), even if they're taken from an episode where he's miserable for half the running time like "O, R-V, I N-V U"—which is, along with episodes where he's an understandably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck">agitated</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoRespectGuy">No Respect Guy</a> or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SatelliteCharacter">Satellite Character</a>, the <em>status quo.</em>
</li><li> Episodes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAvengersEarthsMightiestHeroes">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes!</a></em> Season Two begin with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a> creating the impression that the Avengers consist entirely of the "Big Three" — Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor — and the Incredible Hulk. Thanks to villains who try to weaken the Avengers by separating their members, the succeeding episode will more often than not feature only one, two, or three of those heroes, fighting alongside some less-iconic Avengers.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedAdaptation">Animated Adaptation</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AnneOfGreenGables">Anne of Green Gables</a></em>, Anne is shown in the opening credits wearing her iconic straw hat, which she does not wear at all in any episode (though it is seen hanging in her room on occasion).
</li><li> The opening for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS16E6IShouldHaveNeverGoneZiplining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SouthParkS16E6IShouldHaveNeverGoneZiplining">I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining</a>" features the boys apparently in danger while ziplining. There's even a few shots of the boys being all bloody. In the actual episode, however, they are in no real danger whenever they are actually ziplining. They never even get into any ziplining accidents. All the distress actually comes from the tour group they were forced to be a part of.
</li><li> The opening for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeverlyHillsTeens">Beverly Hills Teens</a></em> makes it look like a show about surreal and over-the-top globetrotting adventures. While wacky stuff does occasionally happen, it's more of a sitcom-esque <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of 80's greed and decadence.
</li><li> The lyrics and tone of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> opening sequence suggest that the show is about a wholesome family man in everyday situations. This is of course entirely ironic.
</li><li> The theme tune to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DenverTheLastDinosaur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DenverTheLastDinosaur">Denver the Last Dinosaur</a></em> contains the line "Everywhere we go, we don't even care, if people stop and stare at our pal dino". The characters spend nearly the whole of the first few episodes fretting about whether they've been spotted with the eponymous reptile.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a>'s cartoon shorts (post-1947) feature a theme song that shills Donald, claiming he has "the sweetest disposition", "never, ever starts an argument", and "never shows a bit of temperament". Amusingly, Donald himself reacts to the music, demonstrating his real personality to the audience. The last line, however, is entirely accurate.
<div class="indent"><strong>Choir:</strong> Who's never wrong, but always right? <br/>Who'd never dream of starting a fight? <br/>Who gets stuck with all the bad luck? <br/>No one— <br/><strong>Donald Duck:</strong> (furious, incoherent yelling) <br/><strong>Choir:</strong> —but Donald Duck! <br/><strong>Donald Duck:</strong> Yeah!
</div></li><li> The German opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales1987">DuckTales (1987)</a></em> mentions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PlutoThePup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PlutoThePup">Pluto</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Goofy">Goofy</a>, two characters who <em>never</em> appear in the series at all. The German opening theme for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">2017 reboot</a> has different lyrics entirely.
</li><li> The second opening to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show</a></em> mentions Belle, Snoopy's sister. She never appears in any episode of the cartoon.
</li><li> The Italian <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgXMl7oZiok">opening<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyLovelyLocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyLovelyLocks">Lady Lovely Locks</a></em> makes the show seem like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SliceOfLife">Slice of Life</a> romance. However, romance only comes up a few times in the show and most of the runtime is spent on Lady dealing with Duchess Ravenwaves' schemes to take over.
</li><li> The characters in the opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCrumpets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCrumpets">The Crumpets</a></em> didn't get updated for seasons 3 and 4, which only has teenagers as its main characters. For instance, Li'l One the infant continues to appear in the <em>center</em> among the characters even though he was downgraded by importance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> has three openings. One used up until part-way into the second season, another for the rest of the original series, and a third for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelSeries">Sequel Series</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaleSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinaleSeason">Finale Season</a> <em>Steven Universe Future</em>. The first two were accurate when first seen, but quickly became outdated:
<ul><li> The first intro is a pretty good summary of what season one is like... except it leaves out any sort of hint towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonTwist">Mid-Season Twist</a> that kicks off <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">the real plot of the show</a>. This is, of course, intentional.
</li><li> The second intro is a much stronger example; while it accounts for the status quo changes in season two, like Connie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">joining the Crystal Gems</a> and the introduction of the Homeworld Gems, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArtifact">it quickly became outdated</a> once said season was over. It continues to portray Lapis and Peridot as villains and Jasper as a major threat long after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">the former two have sided with the heroes</a> and the latter has <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">been corrupted and imprisoned</span>. Its tone increasingly clashes with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">the more serialized and dramatic turns the plot takes</a>, and it never touches on major reveals and events like the trips to space or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roses true identity</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The theme song of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug">Miraculous Ladybug</a></em> suggests that the action takes place during the night. In truth, nearly all of the fights in the series take place in broad daylight.
