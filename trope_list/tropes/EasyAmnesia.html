It comes in two flavors: psychogenic amnesia, which comes from a psychological trauma, and organic amnesia, which comes from brain damage. In the former case, the sufferer might get all or part of his memories back through adequate therapy and rest; in the latter, even if he might get back some pieces of information, he most probably will never recover the big picture.
</p><p>On TV, amnesia is just a plot device for the current episode or movie or whatever, and it's pretty much always organic and originated by some kind of funny injury or physical impact. Everything and anything the character knows about him or herself may be lost, or just the last 24 hours may disappear  it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">completely dependent on the plot</a>. This is often used to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a> exposition by making it so the character <em>doesn't</em> know things they should be familiar with; whether it's actually an improvement is down to the individual viewer.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>If the victim recovers, it usually occurs by the end of the episode, with the character simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjuryBookend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InjuryBookend">bonking their noggin a second time</a> (conveniently ignoring the fact that this is likely to make things worse, not better), or with some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> from the resident scientist/physician (which ignores that, as said above, the bonking type is precisely the kind of amnesia that rarely get better in real life). On the other hand, if the victim does not recover by the end of the episode, they almost certainly never will and those memories will be gone forever.
</p><p>Do note that TV usually uses retrograde amnesia (the inability to recollect memories from before the head bump) but almost never uses the actually more organically realistic anterograde amnesia (the inability to create memories after the bump). While there have been a few examples recently, they have mostly been due to the popularity of the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Memento">Memento</a></em>. Even when it does appear in a show, what's depicted usually doesn't come close to the actual disorder.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> has Hana have a bout of amnesia, not remembering how she got separated from the other teams and came to be on a different island. She does wonder if she bonked her head somewhere. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She also doesn't remember that Ango tried to rape her, nor that she was sucked into a whirlpool and was underwater for several days, before resurfacing.</span> A few chapters later, though, she just gets all the memories back and there are no repercussions or after-effects.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nel</span> lost her memory after receiving a blow to the head from <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nnoitra</span>.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And being turned into a child. This, from what we know about Hollows, is something Nel never experienced as a Hollow, and may be one of the reasons for the problem.</span> It is implied that the incident occurred years before the recovery.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>'s treatment of amnesia seems closer to reality than most: Goku got amnesia as a child when he fell out of his Grandpa's hands and down a steep gorge. He never recovered from it, and whenever a character would refer to it, they would almost always mention how Goku nearly died from the fall.
<ul><li> Another realistic treatment is Piccolo's, or rather, Kami's memories. After arriving on Earth in a spaceship as a child, he had absolutely no memories of who he is or what he's doing there - he speculates that he probably hit his head. He also never recovers from it, and unlike Goku he never even finds out what his real name was (not that the reader ever finds out, either; he's called "the son of Katatz" by the Grand Elder or, after Piccolo and Kami <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalityMerge">re-merge into a single being</a>, he calls himself "the Nameless Namekian", but continues to go by "Piccolo" for convenience).
</li><li> Some <em>DBZ</em> video games have re-used this plot device for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatIf">What If?</a> stories; <em>Budokai Tenkaichi 2</em> has it happen to Raditz while <em>Supersonic Warriors 2</em> does it to Broly. Both eventually get their memories back, but have been changed for the better thanks to their time among the heroes (Raditz sacrifices himself to prevent the other Saiyans from attacking Earth, while Broly stays Mr. Satan's friend and student — but still gets fired up when Goku is around).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GaRei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GaRei">Ga-Rei</a></em> sees Kagura lose much of her memory within a period of time. She eventually recovers it in a matter of chapters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfAFairyTaleOfTheTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/EfAFairyTaleOfTheTwo">ef: A Tale of Memories</a></em>: One of the stories is about Chihiro, who can't remember anything beyond 13 hours in the past. This leads to one very dramatic scene, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she passes out for a longer period of time and can't remember why she's so much older and lacks one eye</span>.
</li><li> In Chapter 35 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaouAiren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HaouAiren">Haou Airen</a></em>, Kurumi falls down a flight of stairs and loses all her memories of the events of the whole series. She gets them all back just as easily in Chapter 43.
</li><li> This trope is the central premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OneWeekFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OneWeekFriends">One Week Friends</a></em>, where a girl named Fujimiya Kaori will lose all memories of her friend after a week.
</li><li> A number of characters suffer from this in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim">Dating Sim</a> adaptation <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon">Kanon</a></em>. Specifically, Makoto and Yuuichi. Makoto because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she's a fox turned into a human, so she had to sacrifice her memories and the remaining years of her life to make the transition</span> and Yuuichi because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he blocked out the very traumatic event in his past, and lost all memories of his prior trip to the town, seven years ago</span>.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>, where Yue seems to have this, until we find out that someone accidentally gave her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> about her life, and was too embarrassed to say so, so she just told Yue that she bumped her head.
</li><li> Supposedly happens to Kaito in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em>, but it's revealed early on that it wasn't a bump at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays">Midori Days</a></em> has a slightly more realistic example. A bump on the head eliminates a minor character's knowledge of Seiji's secret. Not only was this unnecessary to resolve the story, it also alters his personality a bit. The brain is a fragile thing.
</li><li> The twins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OuranHighSchoolHostClub">Ouran High School Host Club</a></em> attempt to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invoke</a> this on Kasanoda by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TapOnTheHead">hitting him on the head with a baseball bat</a>. Kyoya stops them, much to their annoyance.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> episode "A Scare to Remember", Pikachu gets amnesia after a Team Rocket attack and Meowth convinces him to be a part of Team Rocket. Pikachu gets cured after taking a long drop into a river with Ash. Doubles as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChineseGirl">Chinese Girl</a> Shampoo, in her first story, reveals she has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressurePoint">Pressure Points</a> technique that lets her modify memories; she not only manages to make Akane Tendo forget who Ranma Saotome is, but also puts a kind of block on her mind so she literally cannot form any mental association with him — which leads to her repeatedly asking who Ranma is after he just told her his name a few minutes ago, much to Ranma's annoyance. Fortunately, Akane Tendo is such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> that the technique gets broken by having Ranma <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultedAwake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsultedAwake">mock her until her sheer rage breaks down the blocks</a>. For added <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialArtsAndCrafts">Martial Arts and Crafts</a> appeal, the actual technique looks like the user is performing haircare on their victim; as the points (understandably) are on the head, and certain herbal extracts are needed to bring out the full effect, it's easiest to disguise the manuever as washing hair.
</li><li> Shinnosuke, a boy from the forest of Ryugenzawa, is forgetful to a crippling degree. Among the things he's forgotten: his own grandpa, the location of the traps he has set for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">animals of the forest</a>, people he's met only minutes ago and the conversations he's had with them, and having saved a young Akane's life ten years ago. When he meets her again (believing it's the first time) he endears himself to her by writing her name all over the house so he won't forget again. Unfortunately, he later forgets having <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">confessed his love to her</span> also, but not <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the love itself</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/RumblingHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/RumblingHearts">Rumbling Hearts</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Haruka</span> suffers from anterograde amnesia after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being hit by a car</span>. This is on top of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the three years she missed while comatose</span>. This could be considered a subversion, as it takes most of the length of the series for her to recover.

Both Jason and Percy have their memories stolen by Hera/Juno, but get them back a few days after joining the other camp of demigods. Jason joins the Greeks almost immediately after waking up with amnesia, but only gets most of his memories back at first. The rest take presumably months to return. Percy wakes up with and spends roughly two months with only the faintest memory of Annabeth and little else, but gets all of his memory back pretty much all at once. While this is appropriate, as Jason needed time to learn to trust the Greeks while Percys <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> allowed him to trust the Romans quickly, YMMV as to whose amnesia was easier.

It is revealed that the conditioning he received in Project Treadstone made him a psychological accident waiting to happen.

May be a more justified example than most: it's implied that his inability to remember the events immediately preceding his fall may be as much psychosomatic (it was a very traumatic injury) as physical.
</li><li> The trope is given a little jab in Isabel Cooper's <em>No Proper Lady,</em> when Simon plans to get around explaining where Joan came from by claiming she hit her head and lost her memory. Joan protests that amnesia doesn't work that way, to which Simon replies that nobody they're telling the story to is going to know any better.

Subverted in that he got from an accident that killed his entire family. Maybe a Self-Defense Mechanism? Or maybe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a side effect of being brought back from the dead</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FallenLondon">Fallen London</a></em> mere exposure to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalColour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FictionalColour">irrigo</a>, the colour of forgotten things, is enough to induce amnesia. It starts off mild, but before long you're forgetting things like who you are, where you're from, and so on. In gameplay terms, it can cause you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelDrain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelDrain">lose skill and quirk points</a>, and the only way to get them back is to grind for them all over again. It's so dangerous that your body will start to grow bone over your eye sockets to protect you from its harmful effects. Occasionally people use it to remove traumas from their memory, while spies use it to forget details they don't want anyone getting their hands on.
</li><li> Largely averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>; there are precisely two cases of amnesia, and neither one is easily received or easily fixed. Terra's amnesia is explicitly magical, stemming as it does from years of wearing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Brainwashed">Slave Crown</a>. Any memories she gets back after that tend to be hazy and less than useful, and while she does make a full recovery, that too is magical. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rachel</span> suffers a far more mundane case of amnesia, that comes about from a serious fall. The entire affair is hugely tragic, and she doesn't recall anything about who she was or who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Locke</span> is until her final moments.
</li><li> In <em>Flashback</em>, at least part of the plot is about getting your memory back, after having it erased by aliens. Later, you find <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you uploaded your memory and left it with a friend just in case something like this happened</span>.
</li><li> One of the sidequest in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> involves hitting someone in the head with a hammer so that they can remember something they forgot earlier. It works, and it's hilarious. Doubly so if you accidentally hit him one time too many and he forgets it again.

It's implied that both of them contracted amnesia after getting battered in an epic fight that happened in the backstory; one of them loses the few memories she has left after recovering from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWaterproofingInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoWaterproofingInTheFuture">nearly drowning</a>. A mushroom restores her memories completely; the other bot only regains a select few of his memories (and even this is arguable) and mostly relies on the word of others for information about his past.
</li><li> Averted in <em>Secret of the Scarlet Hand</em>: a witness suffers amnesia after a bad fall, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a> must collect once-familiar items from his workplace and show them to him in the hospital to help him <em>gradually</em> re-connect with his old memories.

The Pokemon, however, doesn't forget/lose any moves, experience, or stats. In addition, if you switch out with a move like Baton Pass, the new Pokemon gets the bonus stats. Your Pokemon apparently recovers after switching out, fainting, moves like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroughtDownToNormal">Haze</a>, or otherwise ending the battle, so yes, it is truly Easy Amnesia.

This is a cause of concern for many Blades, and, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfWar">Brighid</a> notes, not many are in a position to chronicle their past lives as she does, since a Blade would have no means of preserving or protecting any such records while they're in their Core Crystal form.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouKnow">As You Know</a>, it's mostly hard to remember what happened while you were drunk or shortly before (particularly while the hangover kicks in), mostly due to brain damage.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjaman_Kyle">"Benjaman Kyle"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a very famous and very strange example. He "was found without clothing or identification and with injuries next to a dumpster behind a fast food restaurant in Georgia in 2004." There was evidence of blunt force trauma to his head, and he remembered very little about himself, including his name, his relatives, and how he ended up in Georgia. Despite an extensive and widely publicized search (aided by what should have been helpful details that he <em>did</em> remember, such as his birth date, and details about several places he'd lived), it took over 10 years to figure out who he was, and the breakthrough was made with genetic detective work rather than anyone recognizing him. His real name is William Burgess Powell. To this day he has very few memories of his past, while the ones he does have he is often unable to describe in words.
</li><li> A condition called Transient Global Amnesia exists that is probably the closest real-world analogue to this. A person loses the ability to make new memories, appears lucid, and may or may not be able to recognize familiar people. The duration is usually short and patients recover within a day or less. Its cause remains unknown.
</li><li> People with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttentionDeficitOohShiny">ADD/ADHD</a> can sometimes experience a limited form of this, because their brain's internal sense of what stimulus or information is needs to be stored in the long-term memory is often muddled; their brain basically thinks of everything as equally "important" and may discard parts of memories seemingly at random or fixate on trivial or unrelated details. A person with ADHD might, after having an important meeting with their boss, only vaguely recall the content of the meeting itself, but remember in exact detail what kind of tie their boss was wearing. In extreme cases, people who experience this forget the details of the conversations they're <em>currently having</em>.
