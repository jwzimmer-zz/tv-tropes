<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"My parents were rather traditional. They wanted the heir and the spare, and I was left in the cold."</em>
<div class="indent">— <strong>Sebastian</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>
</div></div><p>Only one person can inherit a throne, that's obvious enough, but history books will occasionally reference <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">kings and queens</a>' desire to have at least two male heirs, an "heir and spare."
</p><p>The reasoning for this is simple. Back before modern medicine, child mortality was through the roof even for the ruling elite. Assuming a prince survived past the age of five, they could still catch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlague">a nasty illness</a>, fall victim to a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingAccident">Hunting "Accident"</a>," or be slain in an overt coup. On top of this, medieval monarchs were often expected to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorPrince">warriors</a>, so the heir might be slain in battle, or even while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingAccident">training for battle</a>. Anything could happen to the oldest child, hence the importance of having a figurative spare tire to keep the kingdom and royal line running. In fact, he could even avoid all of this, succeed to the throne, and then fail to produce any surviving heirs of his own, in which case it would be prudent for his parents to provide him with a brother.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The thing is, the spare isn't going to be expecting to inherit the throne. He may be brought up as a brave knight, skilled administrator, or member of the clergy, but he's not going to be trained to rule the same way as his older brother. So when the worst happens and the spare becomes heir, cue panicked cries of "I wasn't prepared for this! I didn't ask for the throne!" But everyone expects the rightful heir to suddenly step in and do a bang-up job he hasn't been prepared to do, even while he still grieves for the loss of his older brother. The closest analogy to this would be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">Falling into the Cockpit</a> scenario in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> shows, just with less mecha and more monarchy.
</p><p>Note that it doesn't have to be an explicit "older brother dies, younger brother takes over" situation. Something may happen to the heir, forcing a regency. A bastard who never thought of taking the throne due to his illegitimacy may find himself the only one with the claim and the right to combat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> who assassinated his brother and nephews. It also doesn't count if the spare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince">offed the heir to get to the throne</a>, or even if they are eager to get onto it. They have to show signs of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantRuler">Reluctant Ruler</a> who would really rather someone more prepared took over it. If both the heir <em>and</em> the actual throne-holder are lost at the same time, then the Spare ends up finding that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">he is in the big chair now</a>.

<ul><li> Chagum in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MoribitoGuardianOfTheSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MoribitoGuardianOfTheSpirit">Moribito: Guardian of the Spirit</a></em> is the Emperor's second son, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">Spare to the Throne</a>. Unlike most examples he did apparently receive schooling because his older brother suffers from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOperaDisease">Soap Opera Disease</a>, and becomes the heir apparent after his brother succumbs to it halfway through the series. In either case, he is remarkably calm (although clearly not-too-pleased) about it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnatoliaStory">Anatolia Story</a></em>, Prince Kail Mursili has a number of older brothers and half-brothers who have claim to the throne before him. Just about everyone, those brothers included, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">agree that Kail is best-suited to rule</a>, though. Nakia, meanwhile, is desperate for her own son Judah to take the throne. Given that her boy is the youngest of the princes, this means she has a lot of scheming to do to get the others out of the way, even when the poor boy has quite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship">Big Brother Worship</a> towards Kail and does <em>not</em> want to rule. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">By the end of the series, all of Kail's older brothers are dead (including the one who succeeded their father, who appointed Kail as <em>his</em> successor since he didn't have kids) and Prince Judah permanently renounces his claim to the throne after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">also calling out his mother on her evil deeds</a>. By that point, it wasn't a question of whether or not Kail expected to rule so much as when he would actually be taking the throne.</span>
</li><li> Alec from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheBrideOfAdarshan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheBrideOfAdarshan">The Bride of Adarshan</a></em>, as an illegitimate prince born of a mistress, was brought to the palace for this reason when the proper prince (now king) fell extremely ill. He's internalized it so much that he sees himself as nothing but his brother's shadow. That said, he has no desire to be king, as he's not suited for it, despite some people worrying that he's going to usurp the throne. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tragically, his mentor and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> falls under that category, and tries to kill him for it.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>: As a flashback shows, Sabo's parents adopted Stelly, a noble child of even higher status than him, as Sabo kept running away to see Ace and Luffy, among other "lower-class trash" in their eyes. The parents expected Sabo and Stelly to get along, but since the latter was a dick like the other nobles, and only Sabo was kind, it didn't turn out too well. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sabo was shot by a World Noble and presumed dead, ended up with amnesia and was taken in by Dragon's Revolutionaries... while Stelly grew up to be the king of Goa Kingdom.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RoseOfVersailles">Rose of Versailles</a></em> has Louis Charles, Louis XVI's second male child, who finds himself the Dauphin of France when his older brother Louis Joseph dies. In a variant, both Joseph and Charles were still children when this happens (they were respectively seven and four), and it was diagnosed a few years early anyway. Louis Charles never gets to reign anyway, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a> abolishes the monarchy, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MarieAntoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> proclaims him king Louis XVII the moment after his father's execution.
<ul><li> The king's brothers, the Counts of Provence and Artois, and the Duke of Normandy also hoped to invoke this trope in their favor. The Count of Provence then returns in the sequel <em>Eikou no Napoleon-Eroica</em>, calling himself King Louis XVIII after his nephew's death during prisony. While he considers himself as king of France since the moment of his nephew's death in 1795, he doesn't get to actually reign until Napoleon's defeat in 1814-and then is back on the run when Napoleon comes back, at least until his final defeat at Waterloo.
</li><li> Also from the sequel we have Alexander I of Russia—who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">makes sure it doesn't happen</a>: while his grandmother, Catherine the Great, planned to skip his father Paul and have him succeed her directly, she had a stroke and died just as she was about to put it in writing and make it official, and Alexander hid himself until Paul arrived, at which point he was the first to salute him as the new tsar.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>: In spite of belonging to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">the Shinomiya family</a>, Kaguya is not particularly held at high regard by them, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">they consider her a mere accessory to the family's wishes</a>. This further implies that Kaguya is not among the siblings that would immediately inherit part of the empire (given that she has three older brothers, one of whom has a young son), but would have to fulfill the conditions to do so. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The truth of the matter is rather different. Kaguya is actually an illegitimate child, and thus isn't allowed to inherit the company.</span>

The song had Anna lament feeling ignored and useless, hoping one day to find her own place in the community and be helpful.
</li><li> In the movie proper, she still makes comments suggesting she sees Elsa as superior, such as when she earnestly reassures Hans not to worry too much about accidentally hitting her, the Princess of Arendelle, with his horse, because she's "not <em>that</em> princess" and it's not as big a deal to hit her as it would have been to hit her sister, "It's just me." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exploited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exploited">exploited</a> by Hans, who takes advantage of her low self-esteem to manipulate her into trusting him.</span> When Elsa became queen, she gets bumped up to heir apparent, and soon finds herself needing to deal with the chaos that ensues when Elsa flees Arendelle, while retaining the inferiority complex associated with this trope.

Nevertheless, the Eldest of their family, like any other family in this setting, holds particular authority. When <em>nine</em> of her older sisters are killed in a theater explosion, Princess Rennsellaer is thrust into the role of Eldest without having been raised to prepare for it. Some drama stems from the fact that some people  including Ren herself, for a while  thought her younger sister Halley might have been a better fit.

The third has no purpose, and is regarded as nothing by his father. As a result, Prince Galrion focused on magical study, something that incensed his father.

Queen Mab, always one to plan a contingency or three, ensures she has multiple spares for her daughter Lady Maeve.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceRoger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceRoger">Prince Roger</a></em> series by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DavidWeber">David Weber</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRingo">John Ringo</a>, Prince Roger is the Heir Tertiary to the throne of the Empire of Man (third in line, after his older brother and sister); nobody, including his own family, can decide whether he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> or a potential traitorous usurper, so he is specifically <em>not</em> given any guidance in how to exercise power. Then he gets marooned on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a>, and then he finds out he was actually safer on that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> than his brother and sister...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessDiaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessDiaries">The Princess Diaries</a></em> plays this without actually having a death. Or an original "heir" in the first place. Mia is the illegitimate daughter of the ruler of Genovia. Due to politics and her mother's wishes, there's no intention of ever putting Mia on the line of succession, with the assumption that her father will go on to get married and produce a proper heir. Then disease renders him sterile, meaning Mia (who only knows her father has some sort of government position, not even realizing he's royalty) is his only possible heir. She also isn't put right onto the throne, since her father's still alive, but she does meet the trope description of being utterly unprepared for her new role, based upon the sudden lack of other inheritors.
<ul><li> The post-timeskip sequel <em>Royal Wedding</em> reveals that there's a spare too - Mia's half-sister Olivia, who was just two years old when Mia found out she was a princess, and whose existence was kept secret from everyone in the family until Mia's grandmother discovers the truth via activity from her son's bank account. Olivia later becomes third in line to the throne after Mia gives birth to twins (having only recently become pregnant when Olivia was discovered and not finding out until after the sisters met for the first time).

</li><li> Prince Borric was originally a spare to the throne, but his cousin drowned, his aunt passed childbearing age without producing another son, and his father renounced his claim to his brother's throne in favor of his children (believing that the kingdom would be ill served by a king only a few years younger than the one who just died of old age). Though it should be noted that he was promoted from spare to heir sooner or later a decade or more before actually taking the throne (his uncle didn't die until years after it was announced that the queen would not be producing more heirs), so he was ready for the job by the time the crown came to him.

He was so far down the line, no one expected him to be king, and so he was allowed to wander Westeros as the squire of a hedge knight. However, almost everyone ahead of him in line ended up dying of illnesses, wars, and unfortunate incidents. He ended up being elected by a council of lords and became King Aegon V, better known as Aegon the Unlikely.

His older and younger brothers both become kings, leaving him to decide what he's going to do with his life if he doesn't want to hang around and be decorative. He even calls himself "the spare" at one point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga">Vorkosigan Saga</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the age of eleven, Aral Vorkosigan watched as his mother and older brother were slain by a death squad sent by the mad emperor Yuri. While these events happened before the time of the books, they are of critical importance in the relationship between his father, Count Piotr Vorkosigan, and his son, Miles. His mother, Cordelia, was poisoned while pregnant, and the boy was considered lost by both Count Piotr and their doctors, who called for an abortion, with the intent of trying again for a healthy heir.
</li><li> Years later, while Miles was missing and action and presumed dead (which he technically was at one point, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">not so dead as to be beyond the reach of modern medicine</a>), his clone-brother Mark, who had been created in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TykeBomb">a plot to replace him and destroy the Imperium</a>, had to face the concept that if Miles was truly lost ("dead and <em>rotted</em>", as Cordelia grimly puts it), he might have to take up his progenitor's place as heir to the Countship of the Vorkosigan District in the Council of Counts. At one point, Aral himself calls himself the "spare". Despite their rather extreme case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SiblingRivalry">Sibling Rivalry</a>, Mark wasn't all that disappointed when Miles extricated himself from the mess he found himself in after being patched up and made his way home.
</li><li> Barrayar has a really complicated political situation in regards to the throne. Aral's mother was a Princess of the royal family, giving him a claim to the throne of Barrayar if Salic law is ignored. Aral's own political capabilities and support among the military means he's first in line of around half a dozen claimants if something should happen to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Gregor,</a> and many readings of the family tree indicates he as a <em>better</em> right to the throne than Gregor. However, since Aral's son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Miles</a> is deformed and a mutant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">by Barrayaran standards,</a> it would be unlikely for the Vorkosigans to take the throne even if Aral wanted the job. Another princess married into the Vorpatril family, who gave birth to Aral's cousin Padma. Padma had a son, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Ivan</a>, with Alys, a lady of the Vor. Ivan's high birth makes him another contender for the throne, and one character in <em>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</em> states that if Gregor had died, the Vorkosigans would have supported Ivan for the throne.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a></em>, the oldest princess was groomed from birth to become the God-Emperor's wife. The second oldest princess was the "spare", trained in case something happened to her sister. Their father sent the <em>youngest</em> princess instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolfHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WolfHall">Wolf Hall</a></em>, Henry VIII has been reigning for over twenty years but still has some issues with this. When he has a nightmare about his brother Arthur, he feels as though his brother is rebuking him for taking his wife and unbalancing the kingdom through their failure to produce a male heir, and drags Thomas Cromwell across town in the middle of the night to ask his opinion. Cromwell's interpretation is rather that Arthur is <em>encouraging</em> Henry to be the best king he can, especially by throwing off the Catholic Church.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Xanth">Xanth</a></em> series, the Fourteenth Wave, or Nextwave Invasion, of 1061 results in EIGHT spares: King Trent's mind is trapped in the Gourd, where dreams are crafted. His chosen heir, Dor, succeeds him, but suffers the same fate. Eight additional kings take the throne in turn, all but one of whom are older than Dor (in fact, two are his parents, and one is his mother-in-law), before the one responsible for their conditions is killed and the last heir frees all of her predecessors.

George VI was George V's second son, and he had not expected to inherit the throne. The series does a good job of showing George VI's perspective on events: he had set himself up as an ordinary-if-unusually-comfortable naval officer with a happy marriage and two daughters living in an ordinary (for the neighbourhood)-if-unusually-comfortable townhome in Piccadilly. Then his brother decided marrying an American divorcée was more important than his duties and abdicated, leaving the newly-minted George VI with a crown he never wanted and wasn't entirely sure he could handle. Then he not only has to be King, he has to be King during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>.

</li><li> Viserys Targaryen was this in his childhood since Rhaegar was supposed to become king. Then came the Rebellion, Rhaegar and his son died, and Viserys thought to be the legitimate king. But as Rhaegar had the time to marry Lyanna Stark, that means <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jon Snow</span> is actually born legitimate and the ultimate irony of Viserys's life is that he has never been the true rightful king to begin with.

Trevelyan's exact number of siblings is never stated, but it is known that they are the youngest of at least three. The family tradition thus dictated that they would join the Chantry, most likely as a Templar presuming they didn't show magical abilities themselves. Unlike Sebastian, since Trevelyan is the PC, the player has dialogue options which can show that they have a good relationship with their parents, a strained one, or something in between.
</li><li> This trope also appears in the recent history of Orlais, as shown in an <em>Inquisition</em> codex entry. It was presumed that Emperor Judicael I's royal lineage would continue unhindered, as he was the father of twin boys. This was perfectly fine with Grand Duke Florian, his younger brother and spare, who never expected or wanted to rule; however, an outbreak of the Hundred Days' Cough killed both of Judicael's sons and also Florian's baby daughter. Judicael, grieving deeply, was thrown from his horse on a hunting expedition not long afterward, and Florian reluctantly became Emperor. This series of events paved the way for Judicael and Florian's niece, Celene, to eventually outmaneuver her cousin Gaspard for the throne, leading to the Orlesian civil war happening at the time of <em>Inquisition</em>.

If you put all your hopes into one heir, and that heir dies before taking the throne, you're done. But if you have several heirs, then you're safe even if a couple of them bite it. Of course, this almost inevitably results in a succession crisis every time your current ruler dies, but them's the breaks.

And if you have gavelkind succession your titles are split up among your sons. While if you're a Muslim unlanded sons generate Decadence, and considering that Islamic rulers are expected to have multiple wives a lot of sons are expected. Such situations are practically guaranteed to produce a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>.

The king and queen weren't sure that they'd ever be able to have children of their own, so arranged to adopt a prince from an allied kingdom  but now they <em>do</em> have their own child, and Shun became the backup. He doesn't hold any grudges against the new heir, but he does feel useless and unappreciated, as he's not allowed to ever do anything useful  he just has to hang around in idleness until they're sure he won't be needed.

The titular Rislav was the fourth son in line to the Kingdom of Skingrad. His older brother, Dorald, was another spare who was allowed to follow his dream to become a priest of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch">Alessian Order</a>, a radical religious movement sweeping the Empire at the time. When Rislav was 30, a plague swept through Cyrodiil and decimated the royal family of Skingrad. Only Rislav and Dorald survived. The throne fell to Dorald, who immediately ceded the kingdom to the Alessian Empire. Incensed, Rislav gathered a band of cavalry, rode for Skingrad, was allowed in without conflict by the city guards (who were equally upset at Dorald's actions), and beheaded Dorald. Rislav was quickly named King of Skingrad. However, Emperor Goreous (a fervent supporter of the Alessian Order) did not recognize Rislav and did not revoke Dorald's action. He rode with an army to Skingrad but was defeated by Rislav and his Colovian troops. It marked the beginning of the end of the Alessian Empire and the Alessian Order.

<ul><li> Averted and subverted many times in the middle ages as in many countries it took time for the principles of heredity and primogeniture to take hold and before then a reigning monarch could have some leeway in determining his own successor or it was customary to divide the realm up among the surviving sons. In some monarchies the realm was divided up between sons until the 18th century at least, e. g. in the duchy of Brunswick (the electorate of Hanover resulted from one of its partitions). In Russia the ruling monarch had the right to name his or her successor freely throughout most of the 18th century and so did the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire throughout pretty much its entire existence. Meanwhile in some countries younger princes received dukedoms etc. in which they were technically the king's vassals, but could become powerful enough so as to set themselves up as a de facto independent power (the Duchy of Burgundy in the 14th and 15th century) or to overthrow the king themselves (the Dukes of Lancaster and York in the same era). Such a powerful younger brother to a monarch could also quickly morph into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncle</a> to the ruler's children after his death.
</li><li> Has happened many, <em>many</em> times in the history of the Kingdom(s) of Great Britain:
<ul><li> Surprisingly enough, four sons of Æthelwulf, King of Wessex succeeded each other on the throne. Neither was the first son. First son Æthelstan (died between 851 and 855) was known as a warrior prince and defeated a Viking invasion in 851. He predeceased his father. Second son Æthelbald (reigned 856-860), third son Æthelberht (reigned 860-865), fourth son Ætheldred (reigned 865-871) and fifth son Alfred the Great (reigned 871-899) each rose to the throne. Thankfully Æthelwulf was fertile; otherwise the Wessex succession would have ended in the 9th century.
</li><li> Eadred, King of England (reigned 946-955) was a younger son of Edward the Elder. He was the spare to his brother Edmund the Elder (reigned 939-946). When Edmund died, his sons were underage, so the adult Eadred rose to the throne. He died childless and was succeeded by his nephew Eadwig the Fair (reigned 955-959).
</li><li> Edgar the Peaceful, King of England (reigned 959-975) was the second son of Edmund the Elder. He was the spare to his older brother Eadwig the Fair. However, the unpopularity of Eadwig with sections of the Anglo-Saxon church and nobility helped Edgar claim the throne in a civil war. When Eadwig died childless, Edgar became king by default. His nickname, "Peaceful", is a reference to the long-lasting peace and stability of his own reign.
</li><li> Æthelred the Unready, King of England (reigned 978-1016) was the second son of Edgar the Peaceful. His older half-brother Edward the Martyr (reigned 975-978) was the heir and took the throne. However, Edward was a weak ruler. His reign was marked by internal conflict within the Anglo-Saxon nobility and the church. A famine did not exactly help his popularity with the general population, either. When Edward was murdered in 978, 10-year-old Æthelred was the obvious heir. (Just as an aside, he was not Æthelred the Unprepared, but rather Æthelred the Ill-Advised. The Anglo-Saxon word <em>unræd</em> means "bad counsel". There's a bit of a pun in his name, since Æthelred means "noble counsel".)
</li><li> Edmund Ironside, King of England (reigned 1016) was the second known son of Æthelred the Unready. He was the spare to his brother Æthelstan Ætheling (980s-1014), a "warrior prince" with a large collection of swords, prized war horses and combat equipment. The sudden death of Æthelstan made Edmund heir by default. He was about 24 years old when rising to the throne became an option for him. His poor relationship with his father ensured internal conflict for the following two years.
</li><li> Harthacnut, King of England (reigned 1040-1042) himself owed the throne to the death of his older, paternal half-brother Harold Harefoot (reigned 1035/1037-1040). They were both sons of Canute the Great, King of England and Denmark (reigned 1016-1035). However, Canute chose to divide his kingdom upon his death. Harold rose to the throne of England and Harthacnut to that of Denmark, becoming rivals and enemies. But when Harold died suddenly, childless, Harthacnut became king by default.
</li><li> Edward the Confessor, King of England (reigned 1042-1066) owed his throne to the early deaths of various brothers, half-brothers (paternal and maternal) and stepbrothers. By the time his maternal half-brother Harthacnut died, Edward was the obvious candidate to the throne. All other sons of King Æthelred the Unready (reigned 978-1016) were dead, as were all sons of Canute the Great, leaving only Edward and a handful of nephews scattered across Europe. Edward was a son of Æthelred, a stepson of Cnut and the only viable heir on English soil.
</li><li> William II Rufus, King of England (reigned 1087-1100), was the third son of William I the Conqueror. First son Robert Curthose, Duke of Normandy (c. 1054-1134) was arguably the most obvious candidate, but his open conflict with their father lost him much favor. Second son Richard, Duke of Bernay (c. 1054/1055-1081) was killed in a "hunting accident", leaving William Rufus as the heir presumptive and, ultimately, the successor to his father upon his death.
</li><li> Henry I Beauclerc, King of England (reigned 1100-1135), was the fourth son of William I the Conqueror. William Rufus had named Robert as his heir, but when William II died in a "hunting accident" of his own, Robert was away in the First Crusade. Henry took advantage of the situation to take control of the royal treasury, recruit the leading barons of England to his cause and usurp the throne. By 1106, Henry managed to depose Robert and claim Normandy for himself, securing his succession.
</li><li> Empress Matilda, claimant to the English throne (from 1135 to 1153) and ancestor of the Plantagenet kings, was the eldest daughter of Henry I Beauclerc, but his initial heir was her brother William Adelin (1103-1120). When William died in the White Ship tragedy along with most of the vessel's passengers and crew, Matilda was about 18 years old and was already the widow of Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. Left without legitimate male heirs, Henry took the unprecedented step of making his barons swear to accept his daughter Empress Matilda as his heir. Matilda spent her "reign" in a civil war against her cousin Stephen (reigned 1135-1154, who was the son of one of William the Conqueror's daughters), the rival candidate; the issue of the succession wasn't resolved until Stephen accepted Matilda's son, Henry Curtmantle (later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryTheSecond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryTheSecond">Henry II</a>), as heir.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardTheLionHeart">Richard I Lionheart</a> (reigned 1189-1199) was the third son of Henry II. He became the eldest surviving son of Henry II in 1183. First son William IX, Count of Poitiers (1153-1156), died young due to a seizure. Second son Henry the Young King (co-ruler 1170-1183) died of dysentery, having already survived his only child. Richard was already 26 years old before rising to the throne became an option for him. He would spend the next six years of his life in open conflict with his father. Richard himself would ultimately die with no legitimate children.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingJohnOfEngland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KingJohnOfEngland">John Lackland, King of England</a> (reigned 1199-1216) was not an obvious candidate to the throne. He was the fifth son of Henry II, and thus a younger brother of Richard I. The fourth son of Henry II, Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany (1158-1186), was supposedly trampled to death in a jousting tournament, but he was survived by three legitimate children. Two of them were still alive in 1199 and typically outranked John in the succession. His nephew Arthur was the heir for most of Richard's reign. Richard supposedly picked John as his heir in a deathbed decision, probably because John was an adult, while Arthur was twelve years old. The decision would lead to a war between uncle and nephew.
</li><li> Edward II, King of England (reigned 1307-1327) was something of a surprise candidate, though he had been the heir almost since birth. He was born in April 1284, the fourth son of Edward I Longshanks. First son John (1266-1271) died before their father rose to the throne. Second son Henry (1267-1274) was the first heir of Edward I but died young. Third son Alphonso, Earl of Chester (1273-1284) was the heir at the time of Edward (II)'s birth. He died suddenly in August 1284, leaving the infant Edward as heir.
</li><li> Edward III, King of England (reigned 1327-1377) had four sons. He was succeeded by Richard II, the son of his eldest son, Edward the Black Prince. Richard in turn was deposed by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, son of Edward III's third son (John of Gaunt). When Bolingbroke became King Henry IV, this created a situation where the descendants of Edward's second son Lionel, Duke of Clarence, became spares, but spares with (in theory) a better claim to the English throne than Henry IV, V and VI. These descendants included Edmund Mortimer (died 1425) and his nephew Richard, Duke of York. This festering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> ultimately was settled in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarsOfTheRoses">Wars of the Roses</a>, during which Richard's sons Edward (IV) and Richard (III) became kings.
<ul><li> It actually was a little bit more complicated, and the conflict reflects a disagreement over whether <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherMakesYouKing">Mother Makes You King</a> or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">Heir Club for Men</a> was the only club in town. Lionel of Antwerp only had a daughter, Philippa, which automatically meant she was out of the line of succession as it stood at the time. She married Edmund Mortimer, the Earl of March. They had two sons together, Roger and Edmund, who were Richard II's heirs presumptive. Before they could ever be crowned, Richard was overthrown by Henry of Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> of Richard II's court  he was the finest jouster in England and he had a truly massive power base as Duke of Lancaster. Moreover, the death of John of Gaunt and the injustices committed against him by the king made him very sympathetic to the English nobility, who were drawn to him as an alternative king. Finally, he was a grown man while the Mortimer heirs were toddlers. The nobles thought Bolingbroke being king sounded like a great idea at the time, and at that time, it unquestionably was. Eventually, both Mortimers died leading rebellions against Henry, leaving only Anne Mortimer. <em>She</em> married Richard of Conisburgh of the House of York, a scion of Edward III's youngest son, Edmund of Langley, and gave them the senior claim.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardIII">Richard III</a> King of England (reigned 1483-1485) was the eighth son of Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, and the fourth to survive to adulthood. Three brothers and their possible descendants would outrank him in the Yorkist succession. First son Edward IV (reigned 1461-1470, 1471-1483) took the throne and was survived by seven legitimate children. Second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland was killed in the aftermath of the Battle of Wakefield in 1460, dying childless. Third brother George, Duke of Clarence was privately executed in 1478 but was survived by two legitimate children. In 1483, Richard (III) was only tenth in the order of succession. He used some doubts on the legitimacy of Edward's marriage to declare all of his royal nephews and nieces to be bastards. He used the attainder of George (for treason) to also bar his children of the succession. By doing so, he eliminated the succession rights of everyone who had a superior claim to himself in a single stroke. It pays to be the <em>de facto</em> Regent.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>, King of England (reigned 1509-1547) is sometimes suspected to have been this to an extent. He was the second son of Henry VII and became heir at the age of 11. His older brother, Arthur (1486-1502), was supposed to get the throne. Arthur fell ill and died, possibly of the mysterious "sweating sickness", which was an epidemic between 1485 and 1551. Henry got the throne instead. Arthur would have been coached personally by his father and would have been given far more guidance than Henry on how to actually be king. Specifically, Henry VIII was prepared to take a role in the church instead. Kinda funny when you consider that he ended up as the <em>head</em> of a church after he became King.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MaryTudor">Mary I</a> (reigned 1553-1558) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ElizabethI">Elizabeth</a> (reigned 1558-1603), Queens regnant of England, were the only daughters of Henry VIII to live to adulthood. While both served as the heiress presumptive at times, they were eventually displaced by their younger half-brother Edward VI (reigned 1547-1553). They only rose to the throne by outliving Edward and overcoming his efforts to remove them from the succession.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesI">Charles I</a> of England and Scotland (reigned 1625-1649) was the second son of James VI/I. His older brother Henry Frederick (1594-1612) was trained to become King and was considered robust and athletic. He died suddenly of typhoid fever in 1612, leaving Charles as the heir to the throne at the age of 12. Charles was weak and sickly since birth, and had to overcome physical infirmity (weak ankles) just to walk as a child.
</li><li> James II of England/James VII of Scotland (reigned 1685-1688) was the second son of Charles I and the spare to the throne. He rose to the throne by outliving his older brother Charles II (reigned 1649/1660-1685), who died without legitimate issue (his <em>illegitimate</em> issue, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">on the other hand</a>...).
</li><li> Anne, Queen Regnant of Great Britain (reigned 1702-1714) was the second daughter of James II/VII. She was the spare to her older sister Mary II (1689-1694). She only rose to the throne by outliving Mary II and William III, and being a Protestant.
</li><li> William IV of the United Kingdom (reigned 1830-1837) was not an obvious candidate for the throne. He was only the third son of George III. The first was George IV (reigned 1820-1830). The second was Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, a famous military reformer. Frederick was the heir presumptive for most of their brother's reign, but he died suddenly in 1827.
</li><li> Along these lines, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Queen Victoria</a> was rather like Henry II in that she was a distant candidate for the throne despite having been heir from birth. She was the only legitimate <em>daughter</em> of King George III's <em>fourth</em> son: George IV's daughter had died in childbirth two years before Victoria was born, and none of George III's three eldest sons had surviving legitimate issue (plenty of <em>illegitimate</em> issue, but that doesn't count). Every now and again one of the elder princes got it into his head that he might produce an heir; but that never happened, as they were all too old, fat, sickly, and debauched to do so, to say nothing of the fact that all of them hated their wives (and their wives hated them back!).
<ul><li> Incidentally, Victoria was barred from the Hanoverian throne over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">plumbing</a> (and the eagerness of Parliament to divest itself from its continental obligations), so <em>that</em> crown instead bounced to the rather unpopular <em>fifth</em> son of George III, Ernest Augustus.
</li></ul></li><li> George V (reigned 1910-1936) was a spare, serving in the Royal Navy for twelve years (1879-1891)  he even got a tattoo of a red and blue dragon on his arm while in Japan. He became the heir when his (somewhat insane, possibly gay) older brother Albert Victor died without issue even before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">grandma</a> died (giving him on the order of 20 years prepare for the job, but he still would have preferred not to take it at all). It's theorized that the reason these most recent two Georges were such excellent constitutional monarchs is that they hadn't expected the crown and as a result hadn't had the prospect of the crown get to their heads.
<ul><li> George V may have realized this, or at least suspected that his own heir had let it go to his head. He was said to have opined that he hoped David (Edward VIII), his own son, <em>never married or had children</em>, so that "nothing would come between Bertie [George VI] and Lilibet [Queen Elizabeth II] and the throne." And yet it was Edward VIII's marriage that cleared the way for them.
</li></ul></li><li> When Edward VIII (reigned 1936) abdicated, his successor, George VI (reigned 1936-1952), was reluctant to take up the post, as he had never expected or wished for the position. He had served in the Royal Navy during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> (he had to sit out much of it on account of ill health).
<ul><li> For one thing, he had a dreadful stammer and a fear of public speaking. Indeed, it's widely suspected that part of the reason for his death at a relatively young age (56) was due to the stress of being King throughout <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">WW2</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2x0q5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2x0q5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2x0q5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">His heavy smoking didn't exactly help the situation; he developed lung cancer and a bunch of other stuff after the war.</span>
</li><li> It also helped avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">Royally Screwed Up</a>: in a time when royalty was expected to marry royalty, Bertie had a bit of leeway about it since he wasn't expected to become king. He married Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the daughter of a Scottish Earl, in what was essentially a love match (Bertie proposed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoggedNiceGuy">three times</a></em> before she said yes, largely because she was afraid she'd be unable to handle the duties of being a member of the Royal Family). They were so distantly related that Elizabeth II is significantly less inbred than <em>the average Englishman</em>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Roman emperor Claudius (reigned 41-54) was never seriously expected to inherit the throne in his youth. While the Roman Empire had a fairly loose set of succession laws (basically the heir was appointed and didn't even have to be directly connected by blood), Claudius was still too far out on the periphery early on, and by all accounts he was not an ambitious man anyway. He essentially became emperor by outlasting everyone else (including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Caligula">Caligula</a>), who were all too busy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyallyScrewedUp">killing one another off</a> to pay the "doddering old fool" any serious attention.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_II_of_France">Henry II<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCestMoi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LEtatCestMoi">of France</a> seemed relatively fortunate to have <em>four</em> sons at the time of his 1559 death in a jousting accident. However sickly young <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II_of_France">Francis II<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> died roughly a year and a half later (December 1560) at age 16, his brother <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IX_of_France">Charles IX<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ascended the throne at 10 only to die without issue of tuberculosis in 1574, and <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_III_of_France">Henry III<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (who smuggled himself out of Poland less than a year of gaining <em>that</em> throne) was assassinated in 1589 leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">a worsening of the ongoing wars</a> that did not really cease even after Henry II's son-in-law <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_IV_of_France">Henry of Navarre<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was crowned in 1594. (The youngest brother, Francis Duke of Alencon (one of the unsuccessful suitors of Elizabeth I) died before Henry III). Other examples from France (after the primogeniture replaced dividing the kingdom between the sons of the monarch):
<ul><li> Henry I, second son of Robert II the Pious.
</li><li> Philip III the Bold, second son of Saint Louis. His elder brother Louis died at age 16.
</li><li> Philip IV's second and third sons, Philip V and Charles IV, succeeded his eldest, Louis X. Philip V is also suspected of having John I the Posthumous, Louis's infant son, murdered.
</li><li> Charles VII the Victorious was the fourth son of Charles VI the Mad, and two of his elder brothers lived to be 18 and 19, respectively.
</li><li> Charles VIII, third son of Louis XI.
</li><li> Louis XIII was Henry IV's eldest son, but throughout his reign was troubled by the ambitions of his younger brother Gaston, around whom a number of conspiracies against Louis centred.
</li><li> In order to prevent a repetition of a repetition of this pattern, Louis XIII's queen (later widow) Anne of Austria raised her second son Philippe, Duke of Orléans, in a more pampered and effete way, deliberately encouraging his homosexual tendencies, so that he would never become a potential rival for his elder brother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LouisXIV">Louis XIV</a>. (Note that despite being gay, Philippe still founded a legitimate cadet branch of the dynasty that eventually took the throne.) For the same reason, Louis would later cut short Philippe's military career, even though Philippe had (to practically everyone's surprise) proven to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock">one of Louis' best commanders</a>.
</li><li> Louis XV, second son of Louis, Duke of Burgundy, son of Louis the Great Dauphin, eldest son of Louis XIV.
</li><li> Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X were the third, fourth and fifth sons of Dauphin Louis, eldest son of Louis XV. Some see the crisis of Louix XVI's reign (which culminated with the French Revolution and the abolition of the monarchy) as being partly rooted in the fact that his family only began to groom him for his future role as king after his elder brother (also called Louis) died in 1761, although Louis himself only was seven years old at the time.
</li><li> Napoleon III was the third son of Napoleon's brother Louis, ex-King of Holland. Two other Bonaparte brothers, Joseph and Lucien, were older than Louis. Of course, he originally came to power by being democratically elected (as President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte of the Second French Republic), which made his position in the succession irrelevant.
<ul><li> Napoleon I became head of the Bonaparte family even though he had an elder brother, the aforementioned Joseph. When Napoleon became Emperor of the French, his elder brother became his prospective heir, at least until the birth of Napoleon's first legitimate son in 1810 (he already had two illegitimate ones).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Nicholas the First of Russia was one, being a younger brother to Alexander I the Blessed (and yet another brother named Constantine). After Alexander's coronation, Nicholas was "demoted" to just another member of the imperial family, and was never educated as a Tsar (but as a military engineer instead). However, Alexander had no male children, and Constantine had only had illegitimate children and had previously removed himself from the line of succession upon contracting a morganatic marriage, which made Nicholas inherit after the Decembrists Rebellion, which sought unsuccessful to put Constantine on the throne.
</li><li> 18 year old <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_II_of_Portugal">Manuel II (the Unfortunate) of Portugal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a younger son who had just started his studies at the Portugese Naval Acadamy when his father <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_I_of_Portugal">Carlos I<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was killed and his brother Luis Filipe mortally wounded by anti-monarchist radicals in 1908 (Manuel was in the same carriage and suffered a minor wound to the arm). A coup forced him and his surviving family to flee to Britain within three years.
</li><li> Bashar al-Assad was going to be an eye doctor, while his brother Bassel was being groomed to ascend to the position of dictator of Syria. One high speed car crash later and Bashar ended up with a sudden and drastic career change into a series of positions calculated to allow him to build networks of support, eliminate rivals, and gain experience in leadership. Six years after the crash that killed Bassel, their father Hafez died and Bashar assumed absolute power.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/OdaNobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> had several siblings, many of which were older than him and had more legitimacy to be heirs than him, especially since he was seen as a halfwit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">when he really wasn't</a>. He had essentially all of them but his sister killed so that he was ruler by default.
<ul><li> Fukuzawa Yukichi was the second son in a poor samurai family, and while his older brother was very much the traditional sort of warrior, Yukichi grew up with an irreverence for feudal society and a disdain for the ailing Tokugawa Shogunate that would have probably been beaten out of him had he been the expected heir. Instead of becoming a monk as intended, he left home to take up "Dutch learning" and became fascinated with Western technology and culture. When his older brother died suddenly and Yukichi had to take over as head of the household, he liquidated enough assets to settle the family debts and went back to school. Ultimately, the freedom of being the spare to the family line allowed him to become one of the leading figures of the Meiji Restoration, an open-minded samurai who traveled abroad and found ways to incorporate foreign learning to improve his home country.
</li></ul></li><li> The United States does this with elected leaders, by design, with the offices of President and Vice President. Originally, the Vice President was the first runner-up in the Presidential Election (meaning that oftentimes, they held opposing political beliefs), but over time the system evolved so that each party would run a ticket with a Presidential and a Vice Presidential candidate, with the two being considered a package deal. It has been wryly observed that the Vice President's primary job is to hang around in case the President dies, or in particularly "characterful" cases, dissuade attempts on the President's life.
<ul><li> On at least one occasion, a particularly troublesome but popular political figure was appointed as Vice President, with the intent of it being a powerless but prestigious sinecure with which they could keep him out of their hair. And then someone went and assassinated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamMcKinley">William McKinley</a>, which resulted in that Vice President becoming the most powerful man in the country. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">You may have heard of him</a>, his name was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheodoreRoosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a> of this system was someone who had very little in common with the party he was running for, but was included to attract votes. Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WilliamHenryHarrison">William Henry Harrison</a> kicked the bucket and said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier">Trope Codifier</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a>, was in charge.
<ul><li> In the case that the Vice President also dies, then the next in line to the Presidency is the Speaker of the House. Since the Speaker is frequently a member of the opposing party and the President's strongest adversary in Washington, that would be one of the biggest political upsets in history. Fortunately, it hasn't happened yet, the closest America has come is when LBJ was almost shot by an understandably jumpy Secret Service agent who mistook him for a trespasser on the White House lawn the night after the Kennedy assassination.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> It has been suggested that the American system of choosing a Vice President as successor to the President was inspired by the Gaelic system of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanistry">tanistry<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whereby a clan would choose an heir or second-in-command for the chief from among the eligible dynasts. This system was particularly used in Ireland, where it was used to choose the kings of the various native Irish kingdoms that existed over the island's history.
</li><li> This is very much a problem on Despotic regimes in polygamous cultures. The regent may have literally dozens of sons, from different mothers, and there is no legitimacy on succession of the throne. If the regent has not nominated a successor during his lifetime, the usual way to resolve the issue is an all-out civil war and elimination game: the sons of the old regent begin murdering and assassinating each other, with the last surviving gaining the throne. It may well be that he has never been educated to be a regent. Amin Maalouf, in his <em>Crusades through Arab Eyes</em> said the Islamic rulers of the neighbouring countries admired the system of succession of the throne of the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem: when a king died, a legitimate king followed him; in a similar case, a Muslim country would have fallen into a civil war.
</li><li> The Ottoman Empire had an institutionalized framework for fratricide to ensure that the ascending heir could get rid of the "spare" and retain legitimacy. Eventually, this was abolished and replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GildedCage">the Cage system</a> where each heir were kept separately in their own sections of the royal palace, living in luxury. This new system played a part in the empire's collapse. Prior to the cage system, each heir were allowed to travel the empire to get practical experience in leadership. Since it was often the most "worthy" heir that ascended to the throne and likely survived, each one knew they had to be the best to avoid being the "spare". On the other hand, the Cage system kept them locked to the palace for fear of assassination, preventing them from learning about leadership and a world, giving the empire a string of bad rulers at a time when the Ottoman Empire was facing increasing challenge from European powers.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Sweden">Sweden</a> had a modern variation in <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Bertil,_Duke_of_Halland">Prince Bertil<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (1912-1997) who was the third son of king Gustav VI, but surprisingly became second in line after his oldest brother died young leaving a 2-year-old Crown Prince Carl Gustaf as the heir apparent, and his middle brother was disqualified after marrying a commoner, making it very likely that Bertil would have to step in as regent. Further complicating matters was that he'd just fallen in love with a divorcee, whom he now couldn't marry without disqualifying himself and leaving the whole royal line in danger. They ended up living together in secret for over 30 years before finally marrying after Carl Gustaf had become king, married, and had children of his own; members of the press knew about this, but refused to report it out of respect. The whole deal was one of the reasons Sweden was one of the first countries to abolish the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">Heir Club for Men</a> a few years later.
<ul><li> Bertil's great-grandfather, King Oscar II, was an example himself, as he succeeded to the throne after the death of his older brother Charles XV without a son.
</li></ul></li><li> Some linguistic humor regarding military ranks: "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Captain</a>" can generally be translated to mean "Chieftain", the guy in charge. "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsignNewbie">Lieutenant</a>" can be roughly translated to mean "Placeholder", someone who is in charge in lieu of the Captain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreInCommandNow">when they are unavailable</a>.
