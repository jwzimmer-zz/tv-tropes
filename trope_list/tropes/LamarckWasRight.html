With the advent of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilverAgeOfComicBooks">Silver Age</a> onwards, these <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfComicBooks">Golden Age</a> heroes had children.

</p><p>Tough to see, though, how <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">training</a></em> is inherited, or how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">body-mods</a> get passed on. Pretty good chance that any kid that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> might have had would not have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">born with rivets.</a>
</p><p>If the comic or show is rife with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours">My Kung Fu Is Stronger Than Yours</a>, then the superkid will luck out and be <em>at least</em> as powerful as the strongest parent at the time of conception, and often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GooGooGodlike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GooGooGodlike">radically more powerful</a>. This can get interesting if a family has more than one kid, as each succeeding one gets stronger. This usually also applies to fighting skills; they'll be a prodigy black belt before they can walk. If the parent got their powers from a magical or technological artifact, they'll have <em>"internalized"</em> and passed on that item's power. To use a real world analogy: if your mom were an IT expert that always carried around a laptop, you'd have a Bluetooth connection in your head and know how to code a UNIX kernel from scratch.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Other times, if the parent got their power from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a> involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>, their children will all have that same power, regardless of whether it affected their DNA. This also applies to magic and telepathic powers. With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">Functional Magic</a> the reason it's passed down will frequently be less biological than spiritual, so the usual rules need not apply. Another real-world analogy: If your dad were a food tester who developed a high tolerance for poison through controlled exposure, you'd have his high resistance and then some. This one is often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MetaOrigin">Meta Origin</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLegacy">Secret Legacy</a>; for instance, maybe the accident didn't <em>cause</em> your dad's powers, it just unlocked the powers already in his DNA, and he passed the "unlocked" version on to you. This has the advantage of bearing a nodding resemblance to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics">a real scientific phenomenon.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

While very insightful, his theory of "Inheritance of Acquired Traits" incorrectly viewed the cause of evolution as the parents' learned self-improvements in life being passed on to their offspring. Giraffes had long necks because they kept stretching for higher branches over many generations, for instance. While this idea has become closely linked to Lamarck, it was not original to Lamarck, nor was it central to Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory. This sounds dumb to us, but this was not the case at the time, since genetic material had not been discovered yet.
</p><p>There is a real world phenomenon known as the epigenome, that describes how the DNA expression if not actual DNA can be affected by environmental factors in the lives of ancestors. For instance, famines at certain stages in the lives of grandparents can adjust the rates of diabetes in the grandchildren. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VlogBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/VlogBrothers">Hank Green</a> briefly explains the relatively new field of epigenetics in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp1bZEUgqVI">this YouTube video.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Another often overlooked possibility is gut bacteria, which are known to change in response to environmental factors and are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">passed from a mother to her baby at birth</a>. But while this can affect stuff like heritability of IQ or the ability to metabolize milk proteins, it is unlikely to confer say, complex things such as your mother's encyclopaedic knowledge in engineering or your father's macaroni cooking skills. It might tend towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RequiredSecondaryPowers">a better production of muscle/brain tissue or something like that</a>, but skill itself is not biologically heritable.

<ul><li> It's never outright stated, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> implies that Goten and Trunks can reach Super Saiyan at a young age because their fathers had achieved the level before the boys' birth; compare to Gohan, born before Goku ever became a Super Saiyan, and had to earn it the same way his father and Vegeta did. This was apparently a major source of fan contention, since some viewers took a cue from Vegeta and complained it took away from the mythos of how becoming Super Saiyan was supposed to be incredibly difficult. Also, it is noted that we don't know when Trunks was conceived, as it could have been before Vegeta transformed.
<ul><li> One thing to note is the mechanism behind the Saiyan ability to get stronger after recovering from injury (referred to as zenkai) is never explained by anyone with any sort of scientific background, only warriors that care more about the "what" and not the "how". It's possible the changes brought on by the zenkai power up are on the DNA level as well. This would neatly explain why "low class" Saiyans like Raditz are weaker by default than "Noble" Saiyans like Vegeta and Nappa.
</li><li> An alternate fan theory is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementsInIgnorance">they achieved it so quickly because nobody ever told them it was supposed to be hard</a>.
</li><li> Another fan theory is because Goten and Trunks are hybrids; becoming a Super Saiyan requires a dedicated amount of training while also becoming in touch with their emotions, a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a>. Pure saiyans have a difficulty with this, due to being a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knights</a>, but the humanity Goten, Trunks and Gohan have means it is easier for them to achieve because of their emotional connection.
</li><li> <em>GT</em> takes this to the extreme in the final episode by showing distant descendants of Goku and Vegeta (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdenticalGrandson">identical grandsons</a>, actually) can achieve Super Saiyan without even realizing the significance of it.
</li><li> Goku implied at one point that the generations after his and Vegeta's are stronger because the enemies they've had to face were much more powerful; Gohan was strong enough to fight Cell at eleven, while Goku at that age was still frolicking in the forest.
</li><li> Nevertheless, fans still raise a stink about it and the fact that Gohan's daughter Pan cannot become a super saiyan (out of the commonly held/disputed belief that girls can't transform into the state) while Goku Jr. (Pan's <em>grandson</em>) can, only further complicating the matter.
<ul><li> This is true in the <em>GT</em> canon; however, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, she not only transforms, but does it <em>while still in the womb</em>, which given her father's achievements, is a direct application of this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a>'s official statement on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoingInTheWizard">the science behind Super Saiyan</a> bears the original theory out. Since Goten and Trunks were conceived after Goku and Vegeta became Super Saiyans, they inherited their fathers' heightened "S-cell" counts, while Gohan had to earn his the hard way (though it helps that he meets most of the requirements to develop S-cells on his own, just like Goku did).
</li></ul></li><li> The eponymous power-granting brain parasite of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Baoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Baoh">Baoh</a> the Visitor</em> was artificially evolved through the use of a serum that <em>causes</em> Lamarckian evolution. Animals injected with the stuff are deliberately placed in extremely harsh environments, adapt to them, and pass on their adaptations to their offspring, then the next generation is injected and the cycle repeated until something interesting and weapon-ish is produced, leading to the Baoh worm and other rather random creations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Historie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Historie">Historie</a></em>, Eumenes is not only naturally intelligent, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he also inherited his natural fighting abilities from his true, Scythian parents</span>.

<ul><li> The "Battle For The Cowl" miniseries/crossover began to fix that. Another villain points out to Langstrom that it's <em>impossible</em> for a mix of common chemicals to have that effect, that the formula was a psychological crutch for the activation of Langstrom's innate super-powers.

Generally, it's revealed that the various doses of radiation <em>did</em> change their DNA, so the offspring of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a> Silver Agers can officially be called Mutants.
<ul><li> The official Marvel parlance is Mutants for those who inherit the power-granting X-gene, and <em>mutates</em> for those like Spider-Man who've been mutated by some external factor. How the public magically tells the difference is another question altogether — and not an unimportant one, as (with exceptions) Mutants are hated and feared while heroic mutates are celebrated.
</li></ul></li><li> Two <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">Flashes</a> — Wally West and Barry Allen — have had children, and in both cases the children have inherited the speed powers. It's a Speed Force thing, or something. It's even bred true to both of Barry's grandkids.
<ul><li> Indeed, Barry Allen's grandson's <em>half-brother</em> also has speed powers, although neither of his parents ever did. Also, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegacyCharacter">son of Captain Boomerang</a>, he's inherited his father's knack for using boomerangs as offensive weapons. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackestNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BlackestNight">Blackest Night</a></em>, his father's terrible decision-making skills</span>.
<ul><li> On the other hand, Owen and Bart's mother, Meloni Thawne, is a descendant of Barry's twin brother, Malcolm Thawne, as was Eobard Thawne, AKA Professor Zoom, which suggests that the Barry Allen bloodline has a genetic predisposition toward speed, rather than a Lamarkian outgrowth from Barry's.
</li><li> Which can further be explained by the fact that Barry Allen might have been the creator of the Speed Force, and so anybody else in his bloodline will have a higher chance of inheriting speed based powers. Barry's powers themselves are an ontological paradox, as it's been stated in the comics that he went back in time, turned into a bolt of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything">energy</a>, and struck the chemicals which gave him superspeed.

As it turns out, his powers really are inherited - his <em>mother</em> was a werepanther, so it's just an amusing coincidence that his power connected with his old man's gimmick.
</li><li> Scarlet and Sheena Hellpop inherited their father's fusionkasting powers, even though his abilities were given him by the Merk, and were also periodically taken away.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zenith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Zenith">Zenith</a></em> series in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoThousandAD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TwoThousandAD">2000 AD</a></em> relied on this. The main strand of superhumans in the story were able to pass on their superpowers to their offspring. Their powers originated in a wartime experiment where pregnant women were injected with ergot alkaloids. The resulting children's superpowers were mentally derived, you see, and kicked in when the children hit puberty.
</li><li> The DC Universe character Doomsday was created deliberately through a brutal process of Lamarckian evolution, which entailed being stranded on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathWorld">Death World</a> of ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SuperMan">Krypton</a>, as shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanDoomsdayHunterPrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanDoomsdayHunterPrey">Superman/Doomsday: Hunter/Prey</a></em>. When the baby Doomsday was inevitably killed, DNA from the corpse was harvested and used to engineer a clone. This was repeated over and over, until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">Genetic Memory</a> made Doomsday increasingly powerful, resulting in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeform">Ultimate Lifeform</a>... which has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">traumatized into being a fear-inspired</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a>, causing it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">destroy first its creator, then countless other civilizations afterwards</a>.
</li><li> The children of characters in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> having similar powers are usually explained as "mutants" of some kind due to their progenitors' exposure to the weird. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderGirl">Spider-Girl</a> is the daughter of Spider-Man, even though his powers came from an outside source when he was in his teens. So too is Franklin Richards; both his parents were altered by cosmic rays and became empowered. However, taking the cake is probably Rachel Summers, daughter of Jean Grey, who was a mutant of impressive power and a wielder of the Phoenix Force. While it now makes sense, sort of, when she was first introduced, the Phoenix Force was a power that came to beings and could even leave them, as opposed to being a permanent change. Somehow, Rachel inherited that. Being the White Phoenix kind of was Jean Grey's mutation for a while, but not quite, so it almost makes sense, but somehow falls short. Apparently the Phoenix (which is a sentient entity in its own right) just likes fusing with members of the Grey-Summers lines.
<ul><li> This actually became a plot point in the <em>End of Greys</em> arc in the mid 2000s, when the Shi'ar Death Commandos slaughtered the entire Grey family on the assumption that there was a predisposition to hosting the Phoenix in the family - something which came back during <em>Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire</em> and 2013's <em>X-Men</em> run, when Rachel met the Shi'ar responsible for the idea and pointed out how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">the Phoenix Five (and for that matter, Hope Summers)</a> demonstrated that that idea was rubbish.
<ul><li> That said, there may be something to it where Rachel's concerned - even for a Grey-Summers, her heritage is a little unusual. She was born in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DaysOfFuturePast">an alternate timeline</a> (now defunct... mostly). There, Jean never died after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheDarkPhoenixSaga">The Dark Phoenix Saga</a>. When Rachel was created in the mid 80s, this meant nothing special. However, this was before a series of retcons that confused the issue of whether or not 'Phoenix' was Jean hosting the Phoenix/'Phoenix' as Jean's natural full power (the original idea), or the Phoenix Force incarnated as a copy of Jean (the later idea). By the latter measure, Rachel would technically be the child of the Phoenix itself - though this tends to be quietly ignored, along with her creator, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChrisClaremont">Chris Claremont</a>, saying that the Phoenix impregnated Jean with Rachel.
</li></ul></li><li> In Spider-Man's case, the bite changed him on a genetic level, so it <em>would</em> make sense for any children of his to inherit his powers. And to be fair, Spider-Girl's powers aren't an exact copy of Peter's; there's a major difference in how their wall-crawling powers work.
</li><li> For some reason, Franklin and Persuasion are considered mutants, but Spider-Girl isn't (once, to a Sentinel, she read as anomalous but not an <em>X-Men</em>-style Mutant.)
</li><li> Kara Killgrave (a.k.a. Purple Girl, Persuasion, Purple Woman), the daughter of the Purple Man, is another case, as she developed the exact same powers as her father, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">right down to his purple skin</a>. That's despite the fact that he was hit by a rapidly-escaping nerve gas.
</li></ul></li><li> Marvel character Scorpion (Carmilla Black) was designed based on the original plan that she was the daughter of Viper (Madame Hydra). To show she was Viper's daughter they gave her naturally green hair. As Viper's hair is dyed, instead, they ended up with Monica Rappaccini (AIM's Scientist Supreme) as her mother, who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a> <em>also</em> has green hair. It's later revealed that her father might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">Bruce Banner</a>, who apparently fathered her <em>immediately</em> after the incident that created the Hulk, but she lacks any kind of Hulk traits beyond being low-key radioactive. However, this is <em>not</em> because of his DNA, but rather that Monica altered her DNA in the womb as part of an experiment to make her the perfect sleeper agent, and all her powers come from that.
</li><li> Speaking of Dr. Banner, he's had three children post-Hulk. His daughter Lyra has green skin and some super-strength, but averts the trope because she was created via genetic engineering. His son Skaar is able to become a Hulk himself, while his twin Hiro-Kala appears to have inherited nothing of the Hulk (implying they're likely fraternal twins).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> received his powers (physical attributes at the absolute peak of human perfection) from a shot of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> Serum; after that the serum was tested on black soldiers, and of the initial test subjects, only Isiah Bradley survived, gaining the peak physicality. Bradley's son, Josiah, inherited the Super Soldier Serum effects from his father. He uses the name Josiah X in his hero career. Bradley's grandson, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/YoungAvengers">Elijah Bradley</a>, gets seriously injured when the Skrulls attack New York, and after a blood transfusion from his grandfather, gained the traits of Captain America. This is somewhat better than the standard explanation.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates">The Ultimates</a>, Cap's son inherits superpowers. The son, however, appears to be better with them than Cap ever was, mostly because of training from a young age.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateXMen">Ultimate X-Men</a></em>, Wolverine's son not only inherited his exact powerset but also the ability to coat his bones in metal in an apparent emulation of his father's artificial enhancement.
</li><li> While not really offspring, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> "Jokerizes" scores of supervillains in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JokersLastLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JokersLastLaugh">The Last Laugh</a> storyline. He does this via an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a> that infuses everyone with his DNA, turning their skin white, hair green and giving them Joker's sense of humor and making them loyal to him. How this works when the Joker's skin and hair color is not due to any sort of genetics but his skin and hair being permanently bleached from (in the usual backstories) falling into a vat of chemicals is not explained.
<ul><li> For that matter, how does being "loyal to him" qualify as one of the traits in Joker's DNA? He's chaos embodied, the polar opposite of loyalty.
</li><li> Similarly, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Alien">Aliens</a> comic featured a mad scientist infusing xenomorphs with the DNA of Batman's villains. Not only did one of them develop white skin and red lips, another developed scarring on the left side of its head (as per Two-Face, caused by acid burns and thus even less plausible; Joker's traits could at least be handwaved as saying the unspecified chemicals mutated him) and a third somehow acquired the colouring of Scarecrow's costume.
</li><li> The "Mad Love" comic played with this trope when Harley Quinn had a number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spots</a> about she and the Joker getting married and raising a family. Their two kids (a girl and a boy) have permanently whitened faces, though it is unclear if they were born this way or if their parents made them up to look like themselves (the latter of which is arguably just as creepy). One image showing Harley giving birth to the children implies that they are bleached coming out of the womb - but Harley herself, who has been stripped down to her bra, <em>also</em> has white skin by this point, suggesting that the Joker wants his entire family Jokerized and painted the babies as soon as they emerged from Harley's womb (though in the picture he's more concerned with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFamilyThatSlaysTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFamilyThatSlaysTogether">murdering the doctors and nurses by handing out exploding cigars to celebrate</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy">Avengers Academy</a> character Finesse has the same powers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Taskmaster">Taskmaster</a>, who gained them by special serum, and it's implied she might be his daughter. When the two of them meet, she directly asks him about it, only for it to turn out that a drawback of his powers is loss of his non-combat related memories, so he has no damn idea.

<ul><li> While it is never explicitly stated that the McManus brothers have had any specialized training; the first movie hints strongly that they were given some sort of training at their mother's insistence (this <em>is</em> explicitly stated regarding their polyglotism), as well as hinting strongly at ties to Irish Republican organizations.

<ul><li> One Cherokee creation myth states that originally, all the world's deer lived in a single cave. When a boy who wanted to hunt them unsealed the cave, they all ran out. The boy quickly shot them all as they fled, but they survived and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">he only managed to hit them in their anuses, because they were running away</a>. As a result, they lifted their tails up. Supposedly, this is why deer keep their tails pointed up to this day.
</li><li> A European folktale says that the reason dogs have wet noses is that the two dogs on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Noah's Ark</a> spent the Great Flood with their noses sticking out in the rain.
</li><li> There are similar tales on why bears have short tails (ice fishing with their tails, getting most of it bitten off by a pike/frozen off by the cold water) and why elephants have trunks (getting too close to a crocodile who grabbed his nose and ended up stretching it before the elephant struggled free).
</li><li> Similarly, the tale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/NorseMythology">Loki's</a> final capture and binding until Ragnarok told of how he tried to escape the Aesir's wrath by turning into a salmon and swimming away. Thor caught him by the tail, squeezing with godlike strength. This is the Norse explanation for salmon having pointed tails.
<ul><li> Siamese cats supposedly have kinked tails because their ancestors used to hold the rings of their ancient Siamese princess owners on their tails while the women would bathe, and the cats would then helpfully curve the tails to hold the jewellery better.
</li></ul></li><li> There are countless tales that explain how a certain animal became what it is, all via artificial means. Be it a certain color they received via paint being dropped on them (like one bird which is very colorful, supposedly cause God was running out of paint and used a bit of everything on the last bird), body "deformations" due to mechanical force (like the elephant example above), losing body parts due to them being chopped off, or behaviors which are supposedly due to past experiences (e.g. the reason all birds are hostile towards owls is supposed to be because the owl messed something up in one folklore, so it seems even grudges get inherited.) In folklore these can be called "once-always" stories; animals, people, plants etc. are the way they are to mark a particular event in the distant past. Mircea Eliade would say this is one of the ways people connect ordinary, everyday things with the distant, mythic past and keep it as a living reality.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a></em> there are multiple examples from the "Book of Genesis":
<ul><li> Though never stated in the Bible, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CommonKnowledge">Common Knowledge</a> that women have more ribs than men, because Adam gave up one to create Eve.

</li><li> Likewise, the idea that men have an Adam's apple because a piece of the Forbidden Fruit got stuck in Adam's throat is neither Biblical nor, presumably, accurate.
</li><li> The snake which God cursed for having caused Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, dooming it to "crawl on its belly for the rest of its days" (implying it moved some other way before).

The hero, raised since infancy in a Chicago orphanage, speaks with an Irish accent because his parents were Irish; speaks, in fact, with an <em>upper-class</em> Irish accent, because he had "an ancestor who used cultivated English". He is musically gifted, able with no training to sing "with wonderful accent and ease", and this is credited to the assumption that he has "a marvelously trained vocalist" in his "close blood".

Also subverted in that everybody on the team is seen to be very different from their parents (who include the aforementioned biker, an abusive drunk, and a particularly nasty conman).

They even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticMemory">inherit memories</a>. Since they are aliens with a very divergent reproductive cycle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">human genetics doesn't apply</a>. What is less justifiable is that the child of two Goa'uld hosts also inherits memories, despite being biologically human.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, exceptionally virtuous people are brought back to life as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">Whitelighters</a> after death—and yet their children inherit their powers no matter what their moral alignment.

Whereas the older Anissa gains <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperStrength">Super Strength</a>, it's the younger Jennifer who directly gains his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">Shock and Awe</a> abilities; however, while Black Lightning requires that he stores electricity in his body to fuel his powers, Jennifer <em>generates</em> electricity as her body keeps producing energy, the implication that she will potentially be stronger than her father one day after mastering her abilities.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>, this apparently applies to an entire species: The Face of Boe is mentioned as being pregnant with Boemina in "The Long Game" and is the last of Boekind in "Gridlock". Then, in "Last of the Time Lords", it's strongly implied that the Face is Captain Jack at the end of his long life. Taking all this at face value, it would appear that "Boekind" are shorter-lived children of Captain Jack <em>who are born in his final form</em>.

This was most notable in his folk influences (both played 12 string guitars), which gave way to more experimental music (in Tim's case, funk, and in Jeff's case, alt-rock), both their signature songs being sparse songs atypical of their regular output (Tim's Song To The Siren and Jeff's cover of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah respectively), his appearance and his early death and cult following. Jeff did not pursue a career in music because of his father, nor with any goal of making similar music, so it is a rare example of this trope in effect unintentionally.

This may say more about the Dark Powers' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> tendencies than about Lamarckism, however.

</li><li> The Dragonbloods in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> benefit greatly from Lamarck being right, as do some mortals to a lesser extent.

This is shown by even having a background (merit trait) called "Breeding" which details the purity of blood and the elemental connection your parents possessed that you inherited. Probably most prominent in the case of the children of powerful celestial exalted, given that the celestial's exaltations themselves are completely non-hereditary.

This is the explanation for the Arcane (standard) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicMusic">Maestro</a> bloodlines, among others.

Where this trope comes into play is that they are so skilled at genetic manipulation, they can even decide whether or not the children of a "spliced" individual has his altered traits or not.

</li><li> Solid Snake of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGear">Metal Gear</a></em> series inherited, among other things, near-inhuman combat abilities and love of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionCube">cardboard boxes</a> from his "father" Big Boss, at least superficially. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">In practice,</a> he had the "least perfect" genes of all his brothers and yet beat them due to his own combat experience.

</li><li> This is one of the main reasons for breeding in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>. The offspring will inherit certain moves from the father (and from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonXAndY">Generation VI onwards</a> the mother as well), and a lengthy "breeding chain" can be set up to get unique moves for Pokémon that wouldn't learn then normally.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> series' Chao (introduced in <em>Sonic Adventure</em>) work a little bit like this. Two Chao born as completely blank slates with randomized stat grades (indicating how well they're going to progress when that stat levels up) can raise their stats through work and raise a stat's grade. If you breed them together, the child will inherit stat grades from one parent or the other and can inherit the <em>improved</em> grade rather than the original.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a> - Geneology of the Holy War</em> (an untranslated Japan-only game for the SNES, which received an excellent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanTranslation">Fan Translation</a>... even if it isn't quite finished), the characters in the second generation (if their mother was paired up with someone) have their skills/stats/stat growths influenced by their parents. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTiers">Character Tiers</a> take this into account.
<ul><li> In the games (in general), it's normally said that only certain bloodlines can use certain weapons. Examples include: the Falchion (FE1/FE3/Shadow Dragon/Awakening); Aum Staff (<a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FE1/FE3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FE1/FE3">FE 3</a>/Shadow Dragon) and all of the holy weapons (Genealogy of the Holy War).
<ul><li> Funnily enough, it's zigzagged in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemElibe">Elibe</a> saga; in <em>The Blazing Blade</em>, only Eliwood (descended from Roland) can wield Durandal and only Hector (implied to be Durban's descendant) can wield Armads. But Lyn and Hector are also descended from Roland, and neither of them can wield Durandal. And in <em>The Sword of Seals,</em> anyone skilled enough in swords or axes can wield Durandal or Armads respectively, and Roy (who is not descended from Hartmut) can wield the Sword of Seals. But nobody except Hartmut's descendants (read: Zephiel) can wield Eckeseax.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>, the children units that can be recruited after a certain point in the story will inherit two of their parents' skills (one from each parent), and their stats will also be affected depending on who their parents are.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> chocobo breeding sidequest relied partly on the birds' rankings in the chocobo racing minigame to produce Green, Blue, Black, and Gold chocobos with special powers.
</li><li> The asari from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> have an element of this. Essentially, because of the way their reproductive system works, it's theorised that the child develops traits that the "mother" really likes about the "father". It's not treated as fact, but more like a popular belief. Given the limited examples, however, the theory seems somewhat supported (though far from proven).
<ul><li> In the third game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Liara's asari father</span> tells her that her grandfather was a krogan, so it's perfectly understandable if she wants to head-butt somebody.
<ul><li> However <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Matriarch Aethyta</span> also lampshades the fact that, truthfully, <em>no-one</em> really knows how it works.
</li></ul></li><li> Like humans, asari can have long-term attachments to partners or come away pregnant from a single joining, which need not be sexual. The single example of an asari most clearly taking after a non-asari parent was a long-term thing, and her father stayed around and told her stories, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVersusNurture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NatureVersusNurture">Nature vs. Nurture</a> thing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> takes this to extremes with livestock breeding. Sheep are usually white, but other natural colors include black, gray, brown, and (rarely) pink. However, sheep can be dyed any color of the rainbow, and this color is passed onto offspring. This feature was implemented by popular request, since blue dye is made from lapis lazuli, a mineral found deep underground, only slightly more common than diamonds.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InfinityBlade">Infinity Blade</a></em> is this trope distilled into a video game. In it, the hero must defeat the evil God King, but will inevitably fail. No worries though, as his offspring inherits all XP and equipment from him, allowing the player to become stronger with each new generation. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As it turns out, that's not true. The main character is actually a Deathless who is resurrected back to a child's body after each death.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims3">The Sims 3</a></em>, parents can pass on their traits to their children. Also, since all hair/eye/skin colors are now equally dominant (opposed to following the basic Punnett model of dominant and recessive that was in its predecessor), you could easily have a child with Dad's blue skin and Mom's pink hair with orange highlights.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em>, Servos would have all the skills and talent badges of their creator (including the gold robotics talent badge required to build a Servo in the first place). Plant-sim babies that are "spawned" independently instead of conceived by <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WooHoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WooHoo">Woo Hoo</a> likewise inherit the skills and talent badges of their parent.
</li><li> Until the 2.5.2 patch for the <em>Conclave</em> DLC, educating children in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings">Crusader Kings II</a></em> could bestow them with inheritable traits like strong, quick, genius... or imbecile.

However, Shiki was taken from them when he was no older than six, so it seems strange that he has such excellent hand-to-hand combat skills when he's never trained and, notably, didn't even know he had them himself. The Nanaya clan also placed a heavy emphasis on selective breeding to produce superior demon-slayers, further suggesting this trope.</span>

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>, Semblances can sometimes share traits between related individuals, but ones that stay relatively unchanged from person to person are fairly rare.

</li><li> Something like this is going on in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a></em>. Getting mutant powers is really really rare. But superheroes and supervillains seem to have insanely high odds of having kids with powers too. What, does using your powers a ton make them pop up in your kids?
<ul><li> Superpowers are explicitly a combination of genetic and environmental factors, super heroics probably come under environmental.
</li><li> According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, the "mutant gene complex" is actually fairly common in the human population of Whateley Earth (about one in seven). It's that complex becoming <em>active</em> (usually at puberty) that's normally quite rare. Depending on how said complex gets passed on and what exactly triggers it, the chances of two "live" mutants who by definition both have it in their DNA themselves producing more mutant offspring could thus plausibly be quite high (non-mutant supers, however, are on their own).

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This idea is tossed around a bit in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.</em> If at least one of the parents is a bender, there's a good chance the child they have will also be a bender. That's not including combinations from different tribes and what not.
<ul><li> The way it's supposed to work is that while what element you are able to bend is genetic (and how much potential you have), whether or not you can bend at all is "spiritual" which seems to mean "random." Thus why the Fire Nation could wipe out all the waterbenders of the Southern Water Tribe and have a waterbender born two generations later (Katara), and why two powerful benders can have a non-bending child (Piandao). This despite it being revealed that bending was initially <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> given by the lion turtles through energybending.</span> "Unique" bending abilities, such as the ability to "see" through the earth and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> moonless bloodbending</span> can also be inherited.
<ul><li> In the latter example it is shown that while the two boys had the capability their father trained them ruthlessly and vigorously so they would learn in a few years what took him decades to do.
</li><li> Azula demonstrates this trope to a degree. Azulon (her grandfather) and Sozin as well as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roku</span> were all talented firebenders from early ages and Azula certainly picked up that trait from them as well. She also inherited their batshit craziness.
</li><li> Curiously enough the ability to "see" with the earth doesn't seem to be a matter of genetics but more spiritual training: Toph, the first known earth bender to "see" with bending learnt from Badger Moles, 'the first earth benders'. She taught Aang and later her daughters how to do the same. In the same way Dragons, Sky Bison and the Moon can teach those with an aptitude how to bend their element (as explained by Aang and Zuko).
</li></ul></li><li> All Air Nomads are airbenders, though. It has been theorized this is due to their high spirituality.
</li><li> Toph invented metalbending, something all her children and grandchildren (except Opal, an airbender) can do, though not as well as her. Then again, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">no one's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamedInStory">as good as Toph</a>. The ability isn't limited to her bloodline though, as she'd taught other Earthbenders how to do so long before ever having children.

<ul><li> Subverted. Absolutely none of the clones have anything in common with their progenitors except for their appearance (and that can be somewhat dubious; for instance, Cleopatra was not a beautiful native Egyptian, but descended from Greek rulers). The only one who even vaguely resembles their progenitor is JFK, who acts like a caricature of the actual Kennedy, due to a combination of insecurity over his masculinity due to his gay foster parents, and his belief that that's how the actual JFK acted.
</li><li> Outright spoofed with Gandhi, who acts exactly how you wouldn't expect a clone of Mahatma Gandhi to behave; he's a loud, obnoxious, dim-witted skirt-chaser. (This has been stated as being a result of his having broken under the pressure of living up to the original Gandhi's legacy.) Still non-violent, though. Sometimes.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Gandhi:</strong> If there's one thing Mahatma Gandhi stands for, it's REVENGE!
</div><ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Had the show been continued, it would have been revealed that there was a mixup in the cloning lab, and his DNA was actually from Gary Coleman all along.</span>
</li><li> Many of the minor clones really do act like their predecessors, though. This is mostly done for a quick gag (i.e., George Washington Carver's clone has somehow genetically engineered a talking peanut).

<ul><li> As mentioned above, recently, it's been discovered that some acquired changes <em>can</em> be inherited, albeit in a weaker, more general, less permanent, and (probably) less important form. The study of this is called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics">epigenetics<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Chemical changes to the DNA can help inactivate or activate parts of it — and because it's still DNA, these can be passed on. For instance, malnutrition might mean that your DNA doesn't methylate properly while you're growing up, and conditions in the womb can affect development of the fetus, which can pass on some information about the mother's environment — how much food is available, and so on — to the child. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hkjv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hkjv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hkjv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Technically epigenetics is the study of DNA being turned on and off <em>in general</em>, something that happens all the time in a living organism. What's recent is the discovery that these normally short-lived changes can sometimes last long enough to be inherited.</span>
<ul><li> Experiments in rats have shown that cross-fostered pups of mothers who exhibit attentive parental care (licking and grooming behaviors, in particular) end up, through the action of acetylation and methylation, having less of an "anxious" response to stressors. When these rats become mothers themselves, they exhibit the same sort of parental behavior towards their pups, so it is a continuing cycle — independent of genotype, the maternal attention is propagated to the next generation and so on.
</li><li> Traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NativeAmericans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NativeAmericans">Native Americans</a> have known for centuries that the effects of stress and trauma can be passed on and account for the high rate of alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide and illnesses like diabetes among Indian people. <a class="urllink" href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/trauma-may-be-woven-into-dna-of-native-americans-CbiAxpzar0WkMALhjrcGVQ">Native scientists and researchers<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are now uncovering the facts about intergenerational trauma. Support organizations like <a class="urllink" href="https://wellbriety.com/">Wellbriety<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> are based on healing and recovery through the application of these ideas.
</li></ul></li><li> Studies of microbiomes (basically, bacteria and other microscopic organisms on a human body) and their interactions with human cells are a significant component of how a human body functions in many aspects. The microbiomes that have been accumulated over a woman's lifetime will be at least partly inherited by her child, thus leading to inheritance of at least some acquired traits.
</li><li> Endosymbiosis is the current prevailing theory on the origin of certain organelles—mainly the mitochondria and chloroplasts—in the cells of eukaryotic (e.g. multicellular) life. The theory is that the organelles were originally entirely separate single celled organisms that were eaten by the eukaryotic cell but not digested properly. When the larger cell divided, so would the organelles, and so they were passed onto descendants without any immediate genetic change. In the course of evolution, most of the organelles' DNA was deleted or outsourced into the nucleus of the host.
<ul><li> Further, the organelles provide an energy source which was not previously available, so it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">could be argued</a> that the cells were given superpowers by something that they ate, which was then passed on to their descendants.
</li></ul></li><li> In the late 1800s, there were several experiments to test Lamarck's theories, including one carried out in Germany that involved cutting off mice's tails to see if their children would be born with shorter, or no, tails.
<ul><li> As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlSagan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlSagan">Carl Sagan</a>?) has pointed out: Jewish boys have been circumcised for many generations, but still every Jewish boy is born with a foreskin. The exception is when they're <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposthia">aposthic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. However that isn't hereditary, rather it's a rare mutation, though it was once upheld as evidence for both Lamarckianism and <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blending_inheritance">blending inheritance<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The other classic example is hymens. Most women are born with an intact hymen even though every single one of their female ancestors had her hymen ruptured.
</li></ul></li><li> Several percent of human genome is <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus">Endogenous retrovirus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> DNA. One of our ancestors got infected by a retrovirus, which made its way into the said ancestor's germ cells. Bingo! Now his/her children inherit the virus DNA with the parent DNA, until this day. Some of the endogenous retrovirus DNA has since mutated and became junk DNA <em>sensu stricto</em>, but some of those viruses are actually still active and facilitating mutations and evolution, for better or for worse (like helping the embryo implant in the womb, or playing a role in several diseases). It is highly unlikely the original infection was via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">spider bite</a>, though, or it would be a rare Lamarckian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment">"Funny Aneurysm" Moment</a>. Gene therapy exploits these viral vectors' ability to integrate themselves into hosts' DNA to make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LEGOGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LEGOGenetics">LEGO Genetics</a> possible, in order to cure genetic diseases forever or make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransHuman">Trans Human</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">Designer Babies</a>.
</li><li> Cultural evolution <em>does</em> work like this, as ideas acquired in life (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">mutations thereof</a>) can be taught to one's offspring.
<ul><li> Linguistic evolution works like this too. Two languages from completely different families may end up sharing common features if their populations stay in close contact for long periods of time. For example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseLanguage">Japanese</a>, Vietnamese, and Korean all belong to different families unrelated to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChineseLanguage">Chinese languages</a>, but they adopted Chinese vocabulary and variants of Chinese writing (though Vietnamese and Korean have mostly abandoned Chinese-based scripts in favour of their own alphabets). Likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YiddishAsASecondLanguage">Yiddish</a> originated as an offshoot of medieval <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GermanLanguage">German</a> influenced by Hebrew and written in a Hebrew-based script, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishLanguage">Spanish</a> and Swahili developed strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabicLanguage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ArabicLanguage">Arabic</a> influence over centuries of Arab contact.
</li></ul></li><li> If your parents are 'intelligentsia' or 'politicians' or 'military middle class' you'll usually be expected to be good at the same sort of jobs, and be expected to grow up as one as well.
<ul><li> Before the development of trade schools and formal educations, most jobs were like this; boys were expected to grow up and take their fathers' jobs, especially more mundane positions, like farming, carpentry, and other manual labor jobs. If a boy wanted to learn a trade different from his father's, he would have to become an apprentice to someone else. It was simply easier to become an apprentice to your own father. Younger siblings might have had more options, though, because they weren't expected to inherit the family business.
</li></ul></li><li> Briefly thought to have occured with second-generation phocomelia, a congenital deformity primarily seen in infants whose mothers used thalidomide during pregnancy. Although the damage inflicted on these unborn children was environmental in origin, a small number of phocomeliacs subsequently grew up, married one another, and (rarely) produced phocomeliac children. Further investigation subverted this trope, revealing that children who'd been deformed by thalidomide had <em>already</em> been genetically predisposed to suffer such developmental flaws in response to chemical contaminants, and their second-generation children inherited a double dose of that susceptibility, making them subject to phocomelia even in the absence of thalidomide.
</li><li> To a certain extent, this is true anyway, though less based upon what your parents did, and more what they <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">needed to do</a> to survive.</em> For example, native-born Koreans <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_odor">don't sweat the same way<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, because not sweating is a way to survive in cold climates. Likewise tanning skin is likely an adaptation to very sunny climates. The process, however, is reversible over time if the need suddenly no longer exists.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/06/07/the-economist-guide-to-parenting-full-transcript/">Analysis of adopted Korean War orphans<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> showed a surprising amount of genetic influence over the life of the child. The education level of the adopted parents had a puny effect on the adopted child's education (each year of maternal education translated to a four-week boost to the child) and the adopted parents had no effect at all on the child's adult income.
<ul><li> That's not necessarily genetic, though. We know that the impact of poverty, malnutrition and stress on foetal development is vast, and that this continues to affect health and intelligence in adulthood.
</li></ul></li><li> Microbes use a set of molecular tools referred to as CRISPR to integrate segments of viral DNA into their own DNA, enabling them to recognize and fight off infections by that viral DNA at a later time. Because these modifications are spliced directly into the microbes' own genome, the resistance is passed down to subsequent generations.
