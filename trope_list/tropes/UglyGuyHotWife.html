This is largely a result of Hollywood-style casting for women's roles in which average-looking women are virtually unknown and unwanted in lead roles, leaving a large number of hotties needing work. Therefore even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHomely">Hollywood Homely</a> women who aren't supposed to be gorgeous are portrayed by supermodel-class women.
</p><p>In addition, the trope both reveals and helps maintain one of the most wide-spread cases of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">Double Standard</a> around with regards to acceptable levels of attractiveness for leading actors and actresses. While actors are held to a high standard of attractiveness, there are still leading roles available for plain looking guys, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFun">funny fat guys</a>, and average joes (especially in comedy, which is one of the main reasons why this trope is so common in sitcoms). The beauty standard for women, however, is much higher; in order to be a leading lady it is an unspoken prerequisite that you are at the very least physically attractive. Therefore, the reverse (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotGuyUglyWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotGuyUglyWife">Hot Guy, Ugly Wife</a>) is almost unheard of. And if it is present, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">usually played for laughs</a>. Basically, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PositiveDiscrimination">Positive Discrimination</a> for men in-universe while remaining plain old-fashioned discrimination out-of-universe.

It also pervades in cartoons and comic strips due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TertiarySexualCharacteristics">Tertiary Sexual Characteristics</a>; the men can liven up the artists' art styles, but the women have to be differentiated. This requires <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HartmanHips" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HartmanHips">round hips</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">big bosoms</a>, full lips, and exquisitely-designed hair (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleHourglassFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleHourglassFigure">and often an abstract shape</a>), resulting in a beautiful woman and a cartoonish husband.
</p><p>A popular use of the trope is to have the hot wife be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyIsBad">beautiful on the outside only</a>, and on the inside she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBitch">manipulative</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">materialistic</a>, spiteful bitch who doesn't deserve her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HenpeckedHusband">Henpecked Husband</a>'s kindness, especially if he is just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MealTicket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MealTicket">Meal Ticket</a> for her.

Apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">Immortality Begins at 20</a> is only for female Greek gods given that Hades and Posideon also look decades older than their sisters.

Link and Zelda are teenagers, so not married yet, but it's all but stated that they will be eventually; and while Link isn't exactly ugly, he's sort of goofy-looking, with a longish nose and somewhat dorky mannerisms. Standing next to the stunningly beautiful princess doesn't help his case. But she loves him anyway.

Part of the surprise came because the strip (unlike the rest of the comic strip examples) was drawn by a woman.
</li><li> One of the earliest examples (in the modern sense of the word) are the main characters of <em>The Newlyweds</em>, a turn-of-the-century comic made by George MacManus for the Pulitzer chain, more famous for creating <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BringingUpFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BringingUpFather">Bringing Up Father</a></em>. In the 1940's, <em>The Newlyweds</em> were revived as a complementary Sunday comic to Jiggs and Maggie (although this time focusing on their baby Snookums).
</li><li> MacManus' couple was actually preceded by over a year by F.M. Howarth's <em>The Love of Lulu and Leander</em> on the rival Hearst chain, Lulu being probably the funny pages' first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a>, drawn as a "Gibson Girl".

He himself sometimes has difficulty believing it. Lily has to discreetly dispose of piles of Valentines each year if she wants to avoid hurting the feelings of most of the male population; Severus receives none at all.

Since Riquet had previously used a "gift" of his own to make the Princess smarter and help her with her troubles, it all works out fine in the end. Or perhaps it's played straight: Perrault says at the end that some chronicles insist she merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharmPoint">stopped seeing his disfigurement as ugly</a>.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BeautyAndTheBeast">Beauty and the Beast</a></em> has this between the titular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Beauty</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunishedWithUgly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunishedWithUgly">the Beast</a>, although it takes quite some time for Beauty to fall in love with him. Of course, this trope is subverted when the Beast changes into a handsome prince right after Beauty confesses her love for him or agrees to marry him, but it's still played straight in adaptations like <em>Heart's Blood</em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoseDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RoseDaughter">Rose Daughter</a>,</em> which either portray the Beast's ugliness as something he was born with instead of magically cursed with or have him remain a Beast in the ending.

He's stinking rich, too, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">which is why the woman is dating him</a>. It's not the fantasy mismatch of the truly ordinary-in-every-way guy with the beautiful woman.

Madeline makes up for it, however, by being pure evil.
<ul><li> Ernest's ex, Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn), has also taken the potion, and uses it to seduce him back. The rest of the plot has Madeline and Helen, two drop dead gorgeous women, fighting over poor over-the-hill Ernest.
</li><li> Hawn and Streep were both in their mid-forties when they played these eternally young parts. In an uncommon example, both women are older than Willis; Streep by six years, and Hawn by ten. The film earned an Oscar for visual effects.

</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CouplesRetreat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CouplesRetreat">Couples Retreat</a></em> featured an extreme version of the trope, with the overweight Faizon Love and his hot twenty-year old floozy of a girl, played by Kali Hawk (he wasn't even rich — but he acted like he had money, buying her a motorcycle). Lesser examples include the pudgy, slobby, older Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn being hooked up with the gorgeous Kristin Davis and Malin Akerman, respectively.

Considering that both suffer crushing sexual repression and have borderline nymphomaniac traits as well, they seem suited for each other. Julia's a member of a harsh chastity brigade, and sees sex as her best way of sticking it to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMan">The Man</a>. So she's not terribly picky. Winston even tries to <em>discourage</em> her from banging him, asking why she hasn't chosen somebody her age. Julia replies that honestly, she couldn't care less.

Humphrey, even as a young man, has always been short, gnome-like, and grumpy, while his wives have ranged from "merely" pretty (Sofia Socksorter) to inhumanly beautiful (Dana Demoness).
</li><li> Xanth has a few examples, as some attractive women (and they're <em>all</em> attractive in those books) have married actual <em>monsters</em>. Tandy and Smash the Ogre for instance. He's half human, but still looks mostly like an ogre (who are ugly enough to curdle milk by looking at it).

It helps when the Incarnations of Faith &amp; Time team up to do some match making.

Bob is kind, gentle and has a great sense of humor. Abishola, on the other hand, has a lot of issues beneath her beauty. Some due to her difficulty adapting to American culture, some due to childhood abuse. But she does genuinely like Bob, flaws and all. Bob's ex-wife Lorraine was also out of his league looks-wise, but seeing as how she cheated on him with his childhood best friend, he's more beautiful than her where it matters.

<ul><li> Short, stocky and balding George Costanza date models and other hot, thin women, and while, his eventual fiancee, Susan, was not quite a supermodel, she was still a bit out of his league.

One example (which seemed to be lampshading this trend) has him being approached by a gorgeous woman who had initially mistaken him for her boyfriend. Already stunned at the idea that a man like him could end up with a woman like this, George is further gobsmacked when the woman indicates that he's BETTER looking than her boyfriend, saying that George appears to be both taller and in better shape than the man in question.

According to this article <a class="urllink" href="http://www.livescience.com/7483-beautiful-women-marry-attractive-men.html">http://www.livescience.com/7483-beautiful-women-marry-attractive-men.html<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, women tend to marry men who are less attractive and in some cases, not as smart. At the very least, it would lead to a happier marriage or long term relationship. The reason is because men value beauty and women value emotional support. If a man finds his wife beautiful, or at least more attractive than him, then he will be happier and dote on her more, giving her emotional support, which makes her happier as well. A more attractive man is more likely to feel he can do better or be more tempted to seek other women as he knows they find him attractive. Because of that, he becomes unhappy and gives his wife less support, resulting in her being unhappy as well.

Big Bob has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlUnibrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigOlUnibrow">Big Ol' Unibrow</a>, a big nose, gray hair (and by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnoldTheJungleMovie">Hey Arnold! The Jungle Movie</a></em>, has a bald spot) and a bit of a gut, and like Oskar has a very unpleasant personality. Miriam is a blonde <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">Meganekko</a> who, despite being drunk as hell most of the time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">is a total stunner when she tries</a>.
</li><li> The Wittenbergs. Jack is overweight, while his wife Tish is a good looking blond. It helps that they're both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionFreak">Competition Freaks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">jerks with hearts of gold</a> who speak in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Malaproper">malaproper</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Stumpy is considered in-universe to be absolutely hideous. His girlfriend Ursula is never shown onscreen, but the other characters all say she's very beautiful.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em>:
<ul><li> Luanne Platter is an attractive but mostly dumb blonde who eventually married an ugly bucktoothed middle aged hillbilly known as Lucky.
</li><li> Dale and Nancy. Dale is scrawny (but "flexible" as Nancy puts it), with a gut, beady eyes, and bald ("and not in that attractive way, like Sean Connery"), and Nancy's a frequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MsFanservice">Ms. Fanservice</a> target with her string bikinis. But it's his staggering idiocy, devotion to absurd conspiracy theories, and all around giblet-headedness that make you wonder how the two ever got together. That said, Nancy spent over a decade cheating on Dale with John Redcorn and primarily kept married to Dale for the sake of their son (who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateBaby">quite obviously John Redcorn's son</a>) and her career. She eventually falls back in love with Dale after a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> makes her see he's more beautiful than she is where it counts.
</li><li> Bill and his ex-wife Lenore fits this...nowadays. In her sole appearance, Lenore was shown to be very attractive, while Bill is fat, bald, has poor hygene, zero self-confidence, and a stalker-like crush on his best friend's wife. However, flashbacks show that in high school Bill was handsome, fit, confident, and popular, and it's all but outright stated that being crushed by the woman he loved made him stop caring and enter a downwards spiral into suicidal depression.
</li><li> Maybe the most extreme example is Cotton Hill and his two wives, Tilly and Didi. Tilly was a woman with a lot of class who was quite pretty as a young lady and Didi is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainlessBeauty">Brainless Beauty</a>. Cotton was quite fit and handsome as a young man, but by the time Hank was born had already lost most of his looks and was an enraged, screaming, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandicappedBadass">shinless</a> madman who started fights with no provocation, treated both of them like garbage, openly cheated on both of them with strippers, and was an objectively terrible father (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">neglectful</a> to G.H. and outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a> toward Hank). It's taken almost to the point of Deconstruction, since Cotton's marriages are very clearly shown to be abusive relationships that take their toll on his wives' self-esteem and sanity. Tilly divorced him and ended up better for it, and Didi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">(rather quickly)</a> married a wealthy pro wrestler after his death.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>: Chas Finster is very awkward and nerdy, but both Kira and the late Melinda have been shown to be much more conventionally attractive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>: In the episode "The Good, the Bad, and the Beautiful", there was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple">Outlaw Couple</a> Zeke and Josephine Clench. Although they were actually divorced, and while Zeke was clearly ugly and Josephine was a knockout (and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a>, using her skills as a temptress to lure victims close) this Trope was clearly <em>not</em> the reason their marriage failed. <em>He</em> had a restraining order against <em>her</em>, clearly suggesting the falling out was her fault.
<ul><li> The way the Scotsman talked her up, it sounded like this trope was going to be the case with her. Man, what a subversion. He's merely butt ugly, <em>she</em> is an affront to God. Implied to be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoAccountingForTaste">No Accounting for Taste</a>, as he rejects the unnaturally beautiful Sirens in one episode, and at the same time hates their supernatural singing, while he's previously states he loves his wife's singing, despite her gruff and shrill voice. And to be fair, his wife makes up for it with her personality... as long as she's in a good mood.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Homer and Marge, although Marge's attractiveness has been played up over time and Homer has usually been shown as rather average-looking in his younger years when he started dating Marge. The episode <em>The Italian Bob</em> seems to reference this trope, when the end of the episode shows Marge and Homer taking a romantic gondola ride, the gondolier providing his services for the evening puts his own spin on the song "That's Amore", much to Homer's annoyance.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Gondolier</strong>: <em>*singing*</em> When a wife looks like that and her husband's so fat, that's immoral!
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KavorkaMan">Homer has managed to attract several bombshells over the course of the show</a>. They seem to see him as hot. Or maybe it's his personality, which is odd, given the way he acts the <em>rest</em> of the time.
</li><li> Milhouse grows up to be balding with a gut and Lisa grows up beautifully in "Holidays of Future Passed."
</li><li> Homer's mother, as seen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">flashbacks</a> in some episodes, was somewhat of a looker when she was young and Homer was a toddler; Homer's dad, however, was not so much more attractive than he is now, and was also somewhat of a slob.
</li><li> Jeff Albertson (The Comic Book Guy) is obese, middle-aged, rude, and generally not good-looking. Eventually, however, he meets, dates, and finally marries a much younger and far more attractive Japanese girl named Kumiko.
</li><li> Just to show how much the show adores this trope, even if couples are an exception to the rule, either the wife's attractiveness gets played up over the years, or her husband's attractiveness gets played down! Just look at Nelson's parents. Originally Nelson's father was <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/e/eb/636px-Mr_Muntz_earlier_version.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170101232104">tall, muscular, and rather youthful, what with him being the local football coach.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Later episodes that have him alongside Nelson's mother, who was introduced later in the series, <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/3/37/The_Muntz_Family.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20121213232529">just make him an older, fatter version of Nelson.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Flanders are an interesting parody of this trope: During the show's earlier seasons, Ned was portrayed as being not that far from Homer in the looks department while Maude was probably the most attractive recurring character at the time. Starting with season 4's "A Streetcar Named Marge" however, Ned would be sometimes portrayed as being rather athletic; an aspect that would become permanent in later seasons as Maude was killed off and Ned turned from his "religious milquetoast" characterization into his later "bitter fundamentalist" persona (in turn inverting the "guy becomes uglier as the series progresses" rule.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SupermanTheAnimatedSeries">Superman: The Animated Series</a></em>:
<ul><li> Mr. Mxyzptlk (who is a tiny, bald, beady eyed imp) has Gsptlsnz, a hot wife; a <em>really</em> hot wife; a really hot wife who would (and probably could) do anything to get a little attention from him. Oh, yes. (They are both natives of a five-dimensional universe, so they may have different views of what is considered attractive than humans do.)
</li><li> In the comic books, pretty much <em>all</em> the men from the Fifth Dimension are big-headed little imps, and all the women are dropdead gorgeous redhead bombshells. Apparently it's so common for them that it's lost the appeal it would have in our dimension.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>:
<ul><li> Blackfire attempted to marry her sister Starfire off to Glgrdsklechhh, an alien that can only be described as a cross between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Shrek">Shrek</a>, Jabba the Hutt, and an elephant. More recently, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMSQFHNuPKo">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> short depicts him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">married to Blackfire</span>.
</li><li> Not a married couple, but there's Kitten and her boyfriend Fang. Despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a>, she's attractive, while he clearly isn't even human, having a spider for a head. (After she breaks up with him and tries to use Robin to make him jealous, it actually works; he comes back and offers to make up... Unfortunately, what would normally be a romantic reconciliation scene becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">rather unpleasant</a> due to his appearance.)
</li><li> Raven's parents. Her mother Arella is a pretty and otherwise normal human woman, while Trigon, her father, is a giant horrifying demon. Though not brought up in the show, if you know your comic history, you'd know the relationship wasn't consensual.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimonAndPumbaa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimonAndPumbaa">Timon &amp; Pumbaa</a></em>: Subverted in the episode "Beauty and the Wildebeest", where Rafiki helps an ugly wildebeest improve his looks and manners so that he can romance a beautiful gazelle that he has a crush for. In the end the gazelle, touched when the wildebeest is willing to reveal his hideous visage to scare of a rival at her birthday party, removes her makeup and reveals herself to be just as ugly as he is and they both share a kiss before the end credits. In this case it's Ugly Guy, Ugly Wife.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TrippingTheRift">Tripping the Rift</a></em>: Chode, a disgusting purple alien and incredibly hot Six. Then again, Six is a sex robot that he owns, and we have no definition of Chode's relative attractiveness by the standards of his own species (as opposed to us humans, who aren't really qualified to judge). Also, an episode claimed that men and women are both held up to unreasonable standards for attracting the opposite sex, it's just that with women it's looks and men it's money. Six's interest in Chode is also explained in that he had her upgraded beyond being merely a sex bot allowing her to become the ships science officer and treats her with the closest he can manage to respect. Apparently, he's treated her better than anyone else has and she's perfectly capable of walking away if she wants to.
