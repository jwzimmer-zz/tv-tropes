<div class="indent">— <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWorstWitch">The Worst Witch</a></em>, "Let Them Eat Cake"
</div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuity">Continuity</a> has always been a bugaboo for writers, the requisite for things to make sense and follow some form of narrative logic thus limiting the possibilities of what can be done later. A requirement that provides scribes with all manner of headaches, hairsplitting, and plothole-induced dementia. Nevertheless, many series go out of their way to pay careful attention to every little detail that goes on in their worlds. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseBible">Universe Bible</a> is king; nothing can happen that doesn't fit the existing history. Other shows are less exacting, and an occasional continuity error will be glossed over for the sake of the current episode's plot.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Then there are these.
</p><p>Not only is there no established continuity, but the show is free to completely wreck the continuity and be assured of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">a full reboot</a> by the start of the next episode. Burned a hole in your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedWardrobe">favorite outfit</a>? Don't worry, it'll be better next episode. Burned down your house? No worries, it will be back next time. Turned into a frog, died, destroyed the universe? No problem! If one episode ever continues from the last, it's only because it's part of a storyline too long for just one episode  don't expect any apparent changes from the previous episode to be recognized <em>outside</em> that specific storyline.
</p><p>The expectation of a new episode reboot is so strong that, in extreme cases, simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">having continuity</a> can count as a subversive gag (for example, the letters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefaceOfTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefaceOfTheMoon">CHA appearing on the Moon</a> in episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>' forked tongues) or simply the creators getting a kick out of teasing the viewers that have been around long enough (assuming they can remember at least as well as the writers, which they often can).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Generally constrained to American animated shows, or to shows with that style of "cartoony" humor. Often employs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PingPongNaivete" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PingPongNaivete">Ping-Pong Naïveté</a> to allow the humour to work. Often gives the feeling of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a> (even if there isn't one to begin with).
</p><p>The greatest benefit of this trope is that it allows a show to be syndicated out of order, and the lack of continuity means that unfamiliar viewers can watch each episode without feeling confused or "out of the loop". This is why continuity-heavy shows, regardless of popularity, tend to see minimal airtime outside of episode premieres.
</p><p>This doesn't mean everything is always reset, however. The events that setup the premise of the work will always remain, while things like a new character having a proper introduction or a dead character staying dead will occasionally be respected as well, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">Clip Show Episode</a> may avert this by showing scenes from multiple past episodes as events that happened and the characters remember, although that continuity may only apply for this particular episode.

<h3><strong>By Creator:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LeijiMatsumoto">Leiji Matsumoto</a>'s works are known for this. Many of the shows based on his manga and stories, such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyExpress999" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyExpress999">Galaxy Express 999</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em>/<em>Star Blazers</em> and the various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CaptainHarlock">Captain Harlock</a></em> shows, share characters but present vastly different backstories and do not attempt to reconcile the character's actions between the shows. This is not quite an intentional case of negative continuity, but rather gaps caused by each show being produced by a different creative team.
</li></ul><h3><strong>By Work:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> All through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAdventuresOfMiniGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheAdventuresOfMiniGoddess">The Adventures of Mini-Goddess</a></em>, especially with regard to Gan-chan. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the finale.
</li><li> Nicely subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CrayonShinChan">Crayon Shin-chan</a></em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> is expected when Shin accidentally blows up the family's house at the end of one episode, but the event is actually followed by an arc in which the family lives in a cramped studio apartment while the house is rebuilt.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Doraemon">Doraemon</a></em>, most stories are about Nobita receiving a device from the future from Doraemon that does something no modern appliance can, and circumstances ensure Nobita will suffer for it, whether it be losing all of his hair, leaking embarrassing videos of himself to his friends, getting hit by a car, drowning in his own bathtub, stranding himself in another dimension, and so forth. By the next story, he and anyone else he drags down with him are perfectly fine, and Doraemon is ready to give Nobita another device that will inevitably get Nobita into more trouble.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>, negative continuity is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">personified</a></em> by a being known as The Great Will of the Macrocosm, who resets things at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OncePerEpisode">Once per Episode</a>. Though this is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subverted</a> insofar as the Will is not always available, while Episodes 22-25 also have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GainaxEnding">dramatic elements</a> and more or less logical continuity for significant events. Throughout the series, there is also a slight bit of continuity in with all the general weirdness. Then the next episode, aptly titled "Going Too Far" jumps right back to this.
</li><li> The anime <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> is <em>made</em> of this. The only times an episode counts is when they're introducing a new regular cast member, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Milfeulle</a>, Chitose, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselMascot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaselMascot">Normad</a> and the Twin Star Force.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> presents itself to be a case of this. The main characters kill each other and then the next arc opens and everything's fine. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">something very different</a> going on</span>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry">Umineko: When They Cry</a></em> takes this and goes to its logical conclusion — nothing that happens on Rokkenjima <em>actually matters</em>. All that is intended is to convey a series of scenarios slowly revealing clues to the player so that they might solve the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial">not a mystery</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/LupinIII">Lupin III</a></em>, only the essential elements of the story are ever kept... It's part of the reason why the series has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">worked for so long</a>. The only lasting changes ever made to the story (the additions of Jigen and Goemon to the cast) occurred very early on in the franchise's history, during the original manga. Since then, the cast of characters has not moved forward an inch in over forty years.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreenVsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GreenVsRed">Green vs. Red</a></em> is either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew">toying with us</a>, or explaining why there's no continuity of events.
</li><li> Eventually averted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIPart5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LupinIIIPart5">Lupin III Part 5</a></em>, the first episode of which explicitly acknowledges the events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LupinIIITheItalianAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LupinIIITheItalianAdventure">the fourth series</a> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheCastleOfCagliostro">The Castle of Cagliostro</a></em>.

In its second almost appearance, it was noted for constantly launching border raids on other villages, disguised as war games.

</li></ul></li><li> Likewise with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>. Within individual arcs, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingInjury">Game-Breaking Injury</a> would be a serious matter, the Tendo home would be all but demolished and the characters would have to repair it, someone would get in deep financial trouble and stay that way through the end of the plot, or someone would land in the hospital with a full-body cast. All this damage will be undone by the next arc with nary a word from anyone. The only permanent change was the destruction of the Saotome home (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">to force the family, Nodoka included, back into the Tendo household</a>). This was lampshaded once in the <em>early anime</em> when Genma tended to Ranma's neck injury and said it would take a week (the time between episodes) to heal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em> had negative continuity in two episodes just before the end of the series. The first one, titled "Cosmic Collisions", introduces the characters to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a group of dead people who are always searching for a buried treasure that never existed in the first place</span>. The episode ends and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">everyone is killed by a meteor that destroys the surrounding area</span>. The next episode, "Baseball Blues", shows the characters competing in a game of baseball against an American team and everyone on the team <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is severely injured or killed in the end (it's never satisfactorily explained if they actually were killed or not)</span>, while the finale shows everyone in perfect health and in exactly the place where they had been headed for the entire series.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog">Sgt.

However, it does cycle through seasons normally, often changing seasons once per volume, but the characters are never shown graduating or aging at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceDandy">Space Dandy</a></em>: No change seems to stick from one episode to another.

And yet somehow everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">returns back to normal</a> come the next episode.
<ul><li> You think they possibly can't top this but then you have the ending of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">the seventh episode</a> where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dandy has flung far to the distant future in a far end of the universe and having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">ascended to a higher plane of existence</a></span>. "THE END" pops up. Credits roll.
</li><li> The second season finale plays with the series' disregard with continuity.

</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> The <em>Urotsukidouji</em> series. The original, <em>Legend of the Overfiend</em>, ended with the world being destroyed. The sequel, <em>Legend of the Demon Womb</em> began with the world good as new. The pattern was well and truly set.

A prime example is the Moroboshi family's house. During the course of the series, it has been flooded, collapsed, burned down and blown to pieces (and the abuse the interior has taken). Yet the next episode shows it standing proudly(?) with nary a tatami or zabuton askew... and Mr. Moroboshi still on the hook for the mortgage.

<ul><li> In his many failed attempts to become Caliph instead of the Caliph, Iznogoud has been petrified, turned into a dog, lost in a labyrinth, sent back in time, sold as a slave, put in orbit around the Earth, and worse. Nevertheless, everything is always back to normal for the next episode a few panels later.
</li><li> In a notable exception, the album <em>Les Retours d'Iznogoud</em> (<em>Iznogoud's Returns</em>) tries to explain how things returned to normal after some of the vizir's most infamous adventures. It does not always work, as many of those returns end with Iznogoud in an equally uncomfortable situation. That just raises further questions!
</li></ul></li><li> The concept of "Hypertime" — outlined by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkWaid">Mark Waid</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GrantMorrison">Grant Morrison</a> as a way to remove the possibility of continuity errors in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> while freeing writers from the need to remain consistent with the works of previous writers — could be described as "negative continuity through <em>total</em> continuity." The main points were (1) every story ever written did happen and is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a>, even the stuff that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesContinuityError">contradicts the other stuff</a>, however (2) every story takes place in its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">discrete world</a>, and (3) the writer of any given story gets to decide which previously-written stories did and didn't happen in the "world" his or her story is taking place in, and therefore can just toss out anything they don't like and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> discrepancies with earlier stories by saying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">"that never happened in my world."</a> While the idea has its proponents, most tend to feel it causes more problems than it solves, not the least of which is the fact that the only people comfortable with its "anything goes" approach to continuity are the people who never minded continuity errors to begin with. It's now implied that Hypertime has ceased to exist because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in the future (a relative concept since he's already a time traveler), a more competent version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BoosterGold">Booster Gold</a> will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">deliberately eliminate it</a></span>.
<ul><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeWBarr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MikeWBarr">Mike W Barr</a> declared a similar concept years before Hypertime in a letters page in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanAndTheOutsiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanAndTheOutsiders">Batman and the Outsiders</a></em>. In response to a letter noting a certain story in which it was established that Metamorpho knew Batman's secret identity, Barr simply declared that the earlier story did not exist. He asserted his right as a creator to be free of any bonds of previous continuity solely at his own discretion. The howls of outrage from strict continutists echoed through the letters page for months if not years.
</li></ul></li><li> Less obvious but almost as intrusive as Hypertime is DC's "Ten Year Rule" (closer to twelve years since the <em>One Year Later</em> issues), which in the late '90s-early '00s unambiguously stated that no matter when you're reading a given comic, Batman and Superman started their careers 10 years ago, and they were the first significant superheroes to debut since the Justice Society disbanded in the 50s. Other heroes began their careers within the following year and the Justice League was formed roughly at the beginning of the next year. Between this and the fact that some stories weren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">retconned</a> out of existence by the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> (predominantly because none of the characters affected by the Crisis had a full, unambiguous reboot — they just kept on going as they were but some miniseries — "Superman: The Man of Steel" and "Batman: Year One" — re-wrote the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> as needed) has made a mess of the continuity, requiring multiple mini-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossovers</a> to shear off the dead weight.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel</a> has a similar rule to the above, but they don't play quite so hard and fast by it; their flagship characters have aged about 15-20 years since their respective debuts in the 1960s. (But they <em>do</em> adhere to the rule in some capacity, which is why it's not currently, say, 1979 in the Marvel universe right now.)
</li><li> Despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonRosa">Don Rosa</a>'s attempts to create a duck "continuity", the vast majority of writers gleefully ignore it at their leisure, but just as is the case with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> there are occasional continuity nods. Several stories have ended up with Scrooge ruined, for instance. Still, 99% of all duck stories use negative continuity, making it possible for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> and Huey, Dewey and Louie to be surprised at seeing, for instance, dragons, even though they've seen much stranger things at least a hundred times.
<ul><li> There are maybe three or four <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarlBarks">Carl Barks</a> Duck stories which explicitly reference earlier stories (one early issue has Huey, Dewey and Louie capturing a wanted criminal, and in the next issue they talk about what to do with the reward money they got), but other than that, Barks only used broad strokes when it came to continuity. Sometimes a character could have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">Compressed Vice</a> or a particular habit or superstition that was only mentioned in one story, and Donald is shown working tons of different jobs which never last to the next issue, no matter how good he is at them.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthologyComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthologyComic">Anthology Comic</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBeano">The Beano</a></em> Lord Snooty one of the older strips in the comic first appearing in the first issue is a victim of this. Originally the character was an upper class child who liked to run off and play with working class kids, then the kids appeared to live with him with no reference to the past, After disappearing from the comic for about a decade Lord Snooty then appears in a Beano retirement home (he is still a child physically though) at one point in 2001, he briefly appears again in a longer Kev F Sutherland strip as normal and then by Lord Snooty the Third it is implied he is dead and Lord Snooty the Third's grandfather. Whilst characters which are still children e.g. Dennis the Menace interacted with him whilst they were both still children and some of these characters also interacted with Lord Snooty the Third whilst they were both children as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MonicasGang">Monica's Gang</a></em> lives on this, in all these decades of comics, events of stories contradicting later stories, the rules of the universe keep changing, the fourth wall keeps getting harder and softer, members of family of the characters being introduced to never again appear, the designs of the locations being extremely inconsistent, plus the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBookTime">Comic-Book Time</a> where the characters stay the same age for decades so some episodes revolving around stuff from the past when they clearly lived through that time period but the new story says they didn't, and also the vague connection with the teen manga, this is not all bad since with so many years of comics trying to be consistent would be very hard.
<ul><li> A very confusing element of this is Blu's stories where he is portrayed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">comic book star</a> living in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfFunnyAnimals">World of Funny Animals</a> but appearing alongside other characters that are more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">aware of their existence as comic book characters</a> but they aren't acting their stories.
</li><li> However, there are many examples over the years of comics that indeed have continuity between them.

He worked quickly, but didn't care much about continuity mistakes, which are plentiful in his work. His fans never cared about that, though.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PearlsBeforeSwine">Pearls Before Swine</a></em> does this intentionally.

There are a few consistent elements across all the films (Max is/was a cop, oil wars led to nuclear wars led to the apocalypse, some props like Max's jacket and the Pursuit Special, Max's injuries carry over between each film) and the first three films in the series had a mostly logical and coherent timeline, but after Fury Road, continuity was thrown out the window. George Miller has said he doesn't think of the Mad Max movies as a single story, but rather as a series of legends about a mythological figure named Max; and much like real myths and legends, there's often contradiction and inconsistency.

It's difficult to tell what is supposed to be canon, and what is just meant as subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasterEgg">Easter eggs</a> for Toho fans. For example, the dead body of Kamoebas washes ashore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaTokyoSOS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaTokyoSOS">Godzilla Tokyo SOS</a></em>, and Gezora shows up in a video montage in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GodzillaFinalWars">Godzilla: Final Wars</a></em>... both monsters are from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceAmoeba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceAmoeba">Space Amoeba</a></em> (another Toho movie), which otherwise has no connection with any other <em>Godzilla</em> movie.
</li><li> John Lovitz' character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoadedWeapon1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoadedWeapon1">Loaded Weapon 1</a></em> is killed several times and always returns. His explanation? <em>He thought it was a sequel.</em>
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halloween">Halloween</a></em> franchise. The first two films share continuity, even being set on the same night. Then number three tries to transform the franchise into an anthology series. It fails. Four through six return to the original continuity of one and two. Then H20 ignores the previous three, followed by <em>Ressurection</em> which all but kills the franchise. <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobZombie">Rob Zombie</a> does two "reimagings" films which ignore everything to date. Then in 2018 a new ''Halloween which ignores everything except the very first film from 1978.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Highlander">Highlander</a></em> franchise has a staggering amount of discontinuity within a single series; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Highlander">the original film</a>, its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIITheQuickening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIITheQuickening">direct sequel</a> set in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-environmental-catastrophe future</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander">TV series</a> that ignores the sequel and retcons the ending of the first film, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIIITheSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighlanderIIITheSorcerer">third film</a> that ignores both the sequel and the TV series, and two film followups to the series which ignore the third film, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HighlanderTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HighlanderTheAnimatedSeries">animated series</a> set in a post-apocalyptic future completely different from the one in the second film and which ignores everything except the first movie (and most of that as well), and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HighlanderTheSearchForVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HighlanderTheSearchForVengeance">anime film</a> which reboots the story and is set in a <em>third</em> post-apocalyptic future.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFilmSeries">X-Men Film Series</a></em> had gotten this way due to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenOriginsWolverine">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenFirstClass">X-Men: First Class</a></em>, both of which were prequels to the first three films and played fast and loose with the timeline. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/XMenDaysOfFuturePast">So a new timeline was introduced.</a> <em>Wolverine</em> has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonDiscontinuity">officially thrown out of continuity</a>.
</li><li> Special mention should be given to Peter Greenaway, the art house director who has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">gone on record</a> that, not only does he not care about continuity but outright defies it in order to get the right visuals. Take <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCookTheThiefHisWifeAndHerLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCookTheThiefHisWifeAndHerLover">The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover</a></em> for instance; the characters change wardrobes as they walk from one room to the next in order to match the colors and decor of their surroundings.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges">The Three Stooges</a></em>, like other comedy shorts and animated series at the time, had no continuity whatsoever.
</li><li> General rule of thumb when exploring the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre">Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a></em> franchise: by and large, they each only accept <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainSawMassacre1974">the original 1974 film</a> as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> canon, and ignore everything else. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TexasChainsaw3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TexasChainsaw3D">Texas Chainsaw 3D</a></em> was most explicit in disclaiming the other sequels, billing itself as a direct follow-up to the original film. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacre2003">The 2003 remake</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacreTheBeginning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTexasChainsawMassacreTheBeginning">its prequel</a> exist in their own separate continuity.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a> movies made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HammerHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HammerHorror">Hammer Studios</a> lack any sort of overarching continuity despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCushing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterCushing">Peter Cushing</a> portraying Victor Frankenstein in all but one of them.
<ul><li> The second film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRevengeOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRevengeOfFrankenstein">The Revenge of Frankenstein</a></em>, is a direct continuation of the first film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCurseOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCurseOfFrankenstein">The Curse of Frankenstein</a></em>. So far so good? The third film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEvilOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEvilOfFrankenstein">The Evil of Frankenstein</a>,</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> reboot, with Cushing portraying a very different version of Frankenstein whose behavior and backstory differ substantially from what was shown in <em>Curse</em> and <em>Revenge</em>.
</li><li> The fourth film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrankensteinCreatedWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrankensteinCreatedWoman">Frankenstein Created Woman</a>,</em> is completely self-contained, featuring yet another version of Frankenstein whose experiments are far more sophisticated than the others.
</li><li> The fifth film, <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrankensteinMustBeDestroyed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrankensteinMustBeDestroyed">Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed</a>,</em> hints that it may take place in the same continuity as the first two films, but if so then his experiments have gotten <em>cruder</em> rather than more advanced, so it's questionable. Frankenstein seemingly dies in a fire in this one.
</li><li> The sixth film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHorrorOfFrankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHorrorOfFrankenstein">The Horror of Frankenstein</a>,</em> is a self-contained remake/parody of <em>Curse,</em> with Ralph Bates portraying a younger, sexier version of Cushing's Frankenstein.
</li><li> The seventh film, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrankensteinAndTheMonsterFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrankensteinAndTheMonsterFromHell">Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell</a>,</em> possibly follows <em>Destroyed,</em> as Frankenstein has burns on his hands, but again it's unclear.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunners">very long running</a> Spanish <em>Hombre Lobo</em> ("werewolf" or "wolf man") series has <em>no</em> continuity across its eleven films. Paul Naschy stars in every one of them as a werewolf named Waldemar Daninsky, and...that's it. How Daninsky became a werewolf, what time period he was born in (ranging from the 16th century to the 20th), what he looks like in his wolf form, what his occupation is, what it takes to kill him, and whether or not he even <em>can</em> be killed all differ dramatically from movie to movie.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurCClarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s <em>Odyssey</em> novels are notable for each book taking place in a slightly separate universe than the one before it.
</li><li> Similarly, Clarke seemed to also regard the three <em>Rama Cycle</em> books co-written with Gentry Lee as being set in a somewhat different universe to his original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RendezvousWithRama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RendezvousWithRama">Rendezvous with Rama</a></em>. This may be less to do with continuity concerns and more to do with the fact that Lee wrote the bulk of these stories in a very different style and tone to Clarke's writing.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCorneliusChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCorneliusChronicles">the stories about Jerry Cornelius and his friends</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelMoorcock">Michael Moorcock</a> and others, continuity naturally fails between the various twentieth century time streams, and often within some of them in what is, after all, a multiverse.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> was known to disregard continuity whenever it suited him (mostly on the account of not seeing the point in continuity in the first place). The name "Old Ones" referred to both gods like Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth but also strange alien races like the one in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOutOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShadowOutOfTime">The Shadow Out of Time</a></em>. Likewise, he has claimed that the "nightmare plateau of Leng" is in Asia, Antarctica and an otherworldly dreamland in various stories. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">One's sanity is a tenuous thing, after all...</a>

</li><li> In George Orwell's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour">1984</a>, the dystopian government's power comes mainly from their ability to do this by editing historical documents and newspapers. In fact, the main character's job is to correct newspapers, even to the point of inventing completely new characters and events to fill space.
</li><li> The stories in <em>The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis</em> by Max Shulman contradict each other in many ways, as the author's note points out.
</li><li> Robert E. Howard's original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConanTheBarbarian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConanTheBarbarian">Conan the Barbarian</a></em> tales arguably fall into this. While later authors/editors attempted to hack together loose and hotly debatable timelines out of REH's originals in order to forcibly weld them into a background for their own stories, the stories were not written in any kind of biographical order — the first written takes place when Conan is already an aging king, the second gives no timeframe but is commonly assumed to represent his earlier years. Howard himself said simply that he wrote the stories as they occurred to him, and they occurred to him in much the same way a boastful warrior telling campfire tales might recount things in whichever order they come to mind, with any errors in continuity, contradictions, or inconsistencies being the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>. In truth, there are really very few clues as to when in Conan's life many of them take place, except that some of them clearly take place after others (i.e. when he's king, after being named Amra the pirate, etc.).

A few specific examples of this are called out below, but really, until fairly recently this was more the rule than the exception in American sitcoms. Even though syndication and the idea of reruns had been around since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em> the sheer lack of channels meant airing many reruns was unlikely, and because of this, most writers would not pay attention to previous continuity if it got in the way of their own story, especially since most audiences wouldn't remember or care about smaller details (hence the reason a character could mention having a childhood pet cat in one episode and be deathly allergic to them the next.) It really wasn't until several factors in the Nineties that made it easier to recall information, such as an explosion of new cable channels desperate for content heavily airing reruns, the beginning of home video releases on DVD, and the rise of the internet leading to people easily storing and accessing information about shows and characters, that audiences really began expecting tighter continuity from shows and started holding writers to higher standards.
<h3><strong>Creators:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ConanOBrien">Conan O'Brien</a> plays with this trope a lot:
<ul><li> On <em>Late Night with Conan O'Brien</em>, he had a recurring character named Artie Kendall, who introduces himself and explains his backstory to Conan on every appearance, and Conan shows no sign of having seen him before. This is particularly unusual given that Artie is a singing ghost.
</li><li> While Conan was hosting <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTonightShow">The Tonight Show</a></em>, there was a recurring character named Cody Devereaux, to capitalize on the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twilight">brooding, emotional vampire</a>" craze. In every appearance, Cody would get sad, run outside, and spontaneously combust in the sunlight. There would even be a graphic with his year of birth and year of death. Whenever he would appear again, Cody would be fine.
</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Series:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed (1998)</a></em> had a huge, huge problem with keeping anything resembling continuity, whether it concerned elements of the setting (rules by which powers work changing arbitrarily), past events, characterisation, or even props.
<ul><li> The rules according to which various entities are or are not frozen by Piper's power.
</li><li> The power "progression"  the sisters' powers supposedly being meant to grow and evolve  breaks continuity as an idea, since they were supposed to be inherited in the bloodline from Melinda Warren and her powers are specified in Episode 1.
<ul><li> This doesn't really contradict the initial premise, since the sisters still have those powers  they just gain more.
</li></ul></li><li> The way various spells and the Book of Shadows itself work falls into this. Sometimes the same spell is cast in two different episodes, but works differently each time; different, never-before-seen spells may be cast for almost the same result, instead of referring to the previously tested ones; "power of three spells" becoming an established, separate category of spells even though the power of three itself only began with the protagonists; "power of three spells" sometimes need to be said by all three sisters together, sometimes just one, sometimes with holding hands, sometimes just standing there; and the Book of Shadows  said to be "the real source of power"  goes from a list of spells and recipes to a supernatural bestiary.
</li><li> The timeline of the sisters regaining their powers relative to Grams' death tends to fluctuate.
</li><li> The timeline of the characters' births and other backstory elements are wildly inconsistent. The Halliwell family tree indicates that Grams gave birth to Patty when she was thirteen. However, we're also shown that Grams was a hippie at Witchstock in 1967, yet a stately grandmother with an adult daughter in 1975. The sisters' ages when their mother died also varies from one episode to another.
</li><li> Various props don't always line up accurately, such as Prue saying that a page in the Book of Shadows is written by their mother since the handwriting matches the inscription or the back of the Spirit Board... which it clearly doesn't. Another example is the athame from "Bad Warlocks Turn Good"; it vanishes when the warlocks do, yet Prue claims she kept it in "They're Everywhere".
</li><li> Various characters, especially the Charmed Ones' friends, have a tendency to appear for single episodes and are never heard of before or since.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, there is an in-universe <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> when Norm was watching <em>Casper the Friendly Ghost</em> and noticed that every episode ends with Casper being surrounded by friends, but the next episode begins with Casper once again having no friends.

This is reflected in such matters as his character's mother being played by two different actors with two completely contradictory personalities in two episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em> is a somewhat funny example where the show's continuity is actually fairly strong, but the characters don't really treat it that way. This owes to the fact that Frank's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarilyLargeBankAccount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitrarilyLargeBankAccount">Arbitrarily Large Bank Account</a> is enough to bail them out of any permanent consequences, so they tend to treat instances of threatening people's lives, losing massive amounts of money, or committing crimes as water under the bridge. It's very common for characters <em>outside</em> the gang to acknowledge the results of their actions, only for the gang to immediately brush it off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em>: The Bundy family routinely caused great destruction, wound up in jail, or accumulated massive debts in their adventures, but everything was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">back to normal</a> at the start of the next episode. One of the few times the show <em>had</em> continuity from episode to episode was during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> where the Bundys visited England; however, this is subverted at the last minute by having the story end with Al locked up in the Tower of London, sentenced to subsist on bread and water, seemingly for life (which is actually taken as a <em>happy</em> ending by Al, since it gets him away from his horrible family). Next episode, everything is back to normal. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a>, folks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMightyBoosh">The Mighty Boosh</a></em> is hardly the type of show you'd expect to find continuity in anyway but it has a surprising combination of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> plots. One episode has a main character die only to have him rescued from hell by another, upon returning he's asked "I thought you were dead" only to respond with something to the effect of "Yeah, I'm back now," which is treated very nonchalantly. In other examples, Bollo the gorilla dies on one episodes ending only to appear again later. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> example involves them employing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>— Howard reveals that he doesn't play instruments because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">signed his soul over to the Spirit of Jazz to become a musical genius</a>, and now every time he picks up an instrument, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Spirit of Jazz controls him</a>. This isn't remedied in any way at the end of the episode - but the <em>very next episode</em> open with Howard playing a guitar with no ill effects or explanation.
<ul><li> When the Spirit of Jazz reappears in a later episode, he has a name, a backstory and is now a germ that's been trapped in an old jazz record for decades.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnceUponATime">Once Upon a Time</a></em> has developed this in every season post season 2.
<ul><li> The Dark Curse is stated to capture everyone in the realm of Enchanted Forest. In Season 4, despite being within the same realm, Arendelle and Agrabah are seen as untouched by the curse.
</li><li> We also learn that "nothing can escape the Dark Curse" in the first episode. And then a later episode says that Hook escaped the second curse by "outrunning" it. Which goes against the very plot of the show, that no one could escape it.
</li><li> It's stated that once a person dies, you can't bring them back from the dead. Except Maleficent and Jafar (in the spinoff show) were revived from death itself. While Maleficent's resurrection is given some (faulty) logic, Jafar dies and simply wakes up. No explanation.
</li><li> Regina enchants Hook's hook to steal Cora's heart with a wave of her hand. According to season 5, it was a potion that Hook kept which give him this ability. The audience saw the event of Regina enchanting the hook, and no potion was ever involved.
</li><li> We learn in Season 1 that there was only one magic bean left. However we later learn that are millions if not billions still held by the Giants. And then, once all those are destroyed, and the last few beans used, apparently Ruby still manages to still have one... somehow. It's never explained at all, despite it being made very clear there were no more magic beans.
</li><li> It's stated a few times magic cannot be used to kill people in the spinoff Wonderland show. We then constantly see Jafar use magic to kill several people, and that particular rule is never mentioned again.
</li><li> Also, the genie's rules on magic change from the first season of <em>Once</em> to the first episode of the spinoff show. Given that the rules are automatically known to Genies when they are transformed, and apparently something they spout involuntarily, it seems odd they aren't consistent.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> recurring skit character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MacGruber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MacGruber">MacGruber</a> always gets blown up by a bomb along with his partners at the end of every skit, but is somehow still living (and still trusted by the others to defuse the next bomb in time even though he has yet to actually succeed at this task) for the next skit. Subverted in that his first love interest, Casey, is killed off in one sketch and stays dead (due to Maya Rudolph leaving the show). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, however, plays this trope straight when it retcons her manner of death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SavedByTheBell">Saved by the Bell</a></em> rarely had any continuity from one episode to the next.
<ul><li> One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasEpisode">Christmas Episode</a> had Zack and his mother invite a homeless family to live with them, only for them to disappear once the episode ended.
</li><li> The kids' parents, in their few appearances. Usually, they would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">played by a different actor/actress each time</a>, they would be divorced or not divorced, had different occupations, and would even have different names.
</li><li> The "Tori season". Essentially, the show filmed its final season, including the graduation. The network wanted more episodes, but two of the three female leads wouldn't return. A new slate of episodes were filmed with a new female character, and these episodes were aired alternately with the original final season episodes. Therefore, they had Kelly and Jessie episodes interspersed with Tori episodes, with Zack as love interest for both Kelly <em>and</em> Tori, and with neither set of episodes referencing each other.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs">Scrubs</a></em> kept good continuity in the main story, but the flashbacks were free game. JD and Turk met for the first time in so many different ways. (Usually when one opened the door to their dorm room, but which one it was and what the other was doing would change.) Since all flashbacks and daydreams were happening in JD's head, it makes sense that they would continue to change.
</li><li> This trope is one of the charges frequently (and not without <em>some</em> justification) leveled at <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em>. Things such as significant damage or casualties were brushed off a bit too easily at times, thus hindering any sense of the ship being stuck and self-reliant in uncharted space.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes">The Young Ones</a></em> often destroyed their house, each other, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a> all in a single go. All are back by the next episode (fragile as ever).

For instance, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheGoonShow">The Goon Show</a></em> would often have major characters blown up, bankrupted, thrown into prison, killed by wet elephants, or otherwise removed from the story before bringing them back the following week. There was at least one character (Bluebottle) whose schtick was getting killed in every episode. Bluebottle is also a case of far shorter-term negative continuity: "You've deaded me, you swine!"
</li><li> <em>Old Harry's Game</em> is full of negative continuity.
<ul><li> The Professor's character is originally called Professor Richard Whittingham, but in later series he becomes Professor Richard Hope.
</li><li> Satan states that there is no such place as Purgatory (it's an invention by religious people who "didn't fancy their chances", but later Scumspawn celebrates some good news by going to tell "the demons in Purgatory".
</li><li> Satan also states that he's never possessed any human, even though he's previously claimed to have possessed (among others) Eric Cantona, and later possesses a self-absorbed model so she can humiliate herself on live TV.
</li></ul></li><li> Season 3 ends with an appearance by the Archangel Graham, who is annoyed that his name was recorded as "Gabriel." Season 7 features a completely different Gabriel.

</li><li> Early <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em> games in the "Classic" timeline were notorious for this, especially when events that happened in one game would repeat in the exact same manner from the last game and no one noticed or commented on it. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Super Robot Wars Alpha</a></em>, when the writing got markedly better, this trope ceased to be prevalent.
</li><li> Honorable mention: Each route in the games to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultipleEndings">Multiple Endings</a>, although each ultimately has a "True" ending and a "Good" (or "Normal") ending, which are not the same. <em>Tsukihime Kagetsu Tohya</em> exists mostly in a dream and doesn't follow on any particular ending, and <em>Fate/hollow ataraxia</em> is in a time-loop and the same applies. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MeltyBlood">Melty Blood</a></em> takes place after an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">supposedly an unreleased route</a> of <em>Tsukihime</em>. Some endings are "more canon" than others, but it's still nigh-impossible to reconcile them all. Especially since <em>Kagetsu Tohya</em>'s dreamworld incorporates elements of all the endings.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a></em> gameverse also had a sequel series, <em>Galaxy Angel II</em>, where elements from all the endings occurred (most obvious in Lily's character chapter, where her form of initiating Kazuya into the Rune Angel-tai includes re-enacting scenes from every Moon Angel's story).
</li></ul></li><li> The first three <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a></em> games have continuity: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot1996">It starts</a> with Cortex making Crash, then he gets defeated on his blimp, finds the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Crystal</a> and sets the plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot2CortexStrikesBack">Crash 2</a></em> into motion, where at the end his space station gets destroyed. The opening of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped">Crash 3</a></em> then shows this released <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManBehindTheMan">Uka Uka</a>, and by the end N. Tropy, Uka Uka, and Neo Cortex are all trapped in time. After that, it sort of deteriorates with different developers messing around with the franchise, earning it an eventual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> in the form of 2020's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot4ItsAboutTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot4ItsAboutTime">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a></em>, which is marketed as a direct sequel to <em>Warped</em> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelGap">which released 22 years prior</a>).

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em>:
<ul><li> There <em>is</em> an overarching storyline across all six games with consistent characters and villains. However, negative continuity is rampant in the area designs: the internet and some recurring real world places (like Sci Lab in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork1">1</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork3WhiteAndBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork3WhiteAndBlue">3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork5TeamColonelAndTeamProtoMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork5TeamColonelAndTeamProtoMan">5</a></em>; Netopia Castle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork2">2</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork4RedSunAndBlueMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork4RedSunAndBlueMoon">4</a></em>) are redesigned in every single game, and there is an almost completely different set of locations to visit in each game. ACDC Town and its houses had all the same design in the first three games, but were heavily redesigned after the graphical revamp of the fourth game. The only place that never got a redesign was the school in ACDC, which never appeared outside of cutscenes in the final three games.
</li><li> There's also some negative continuity with the characters too. Lan's father Yuichiro works for Sci Lab in every odd-numbered game, but otherwise: It's played straight in <em>2</em>, where he's working at the Official Center (an "internet police" organization); justified in <em>4</em>, where he's recruited by NAXA (a play on NASA and JAXA) due to a global emergency; and in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork6CybeastGregarAndCybeastFalzar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork6CybeastGregarAndCybeastFalzar">6</a></em> he's transferred to a different city to oversee the upcoming Expo. Also, in the third game, Lan's best friend Dex moves to Netopia (another country) in the third game (and returns immediately "as a visit"), but in the following games he is back in ACDC.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is the case with the series in general; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShigeruMiyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> said that there wasn't a continuity simply because it'd limit the development of future Mario games (hence the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> occurring at the end of every single Mario game when the world is saved).
</li><li> While Princess Peach's castle looks more or less the same every time it appears, its surrounding area and sometimes even the interior changes with each appearance, as does the layout of the kingdom surrounding it. In contrast, Bowser's own castle remains inconsistent in terms of design, though the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NewSuperMarioBros">New Super Mario Bros.</a></em> games have their own standardized designs for the outside view of the castle. The latter may be justified that his castle is shown getting destroyed in almost every game it appears in.
</li><li> Like many examples here, there are some times where the Mario games have some continuity:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand2SixGoldenCoins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand2SixGoldenCoins">Super Mario Land 2</a></em>'s manual states that the game takes place after the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioLand">Super Mario Land</a></em> with Wario taking over Mario Land while Mario was in Sarasaland, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandSuperMarioLand3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandSuperMarioLand3">Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3</a></em> takes place after that game, with Wario deciding to go on an adventure to get money to buy a castle of his own after Mario took his castle back from him, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioLandII">Wario Land II</a></em> seems to take place after that, the game starts inside what seems to be the same castle Wario earned in the ending of the previous game.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> is the introduction of Bowser Jr., since Peach doesn't recognize him.
</li><li> The <em>Mario</em> RPGs have more continuity, events from the past games are occasionally referenced, and don't have Miyamoto's input anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the inconsistencies are between the various sub-series (Mario shrinks when hit in the 2D platformers but loses health normally in the 3D ones and the RPGs), but often the subseries aren't even consistent with <em>themselves</em>:
<ul><li> The Mushroom Kingdom in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiPartnersInTime">Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time</a></em> looks almost nothing like it does in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MarioAndLuigiBowsersInsideStory">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</a></em>.

However, the games have elements of continuity, like the SNES trilogy games sharing references, especially in the GBA remakes where more plot is featured in the main game. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></em> features many continuity nods to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a></em> and some to the SNES Trilogy.

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Ever17">Ever17</a></em>. Although the constantly restarting storyline simply does not add up at all, like anything that doesn't add up in the story, it eventually somehow does get explained.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">ZUN has been quoted</a> as saying that this applies to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em> games. It certainly was true for the five games on the PC-98. The series kind of remained like this immediately after the move to Windows with the sixth game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">completely ignoring everything before it</a>, but the next few games at least mention the events of the previous Windows games. Then ZUN started writing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniverseCompendium">Universe Compendiums</a> around the time of the ninth game's release, and the series has had fairly strong continuity ever since. Strangely, this has led to the PC-98 games becoming the <em>de facto</em> explanation for things such as how Reimu met Marisa and Yuuka, making them sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">Broad Strokes</a> canon as well.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> series has some outside of the main canon. You can kill any character and they can still come back in the ending or next game. Averted and played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em>: apparently everything up to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombatArmageddon">Armageddon</a></em> happened and Raiden tried to reverse it all with time travel (actually sending a vision to his younger, possibly alternate reality self), resulting in a very different series of events. Averted in that each character apparently still has their own side stories, which do not run canonically with the main story.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stargunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stargunner">Stargunner</a></em> has two separate backstories, and 3D Realms waffles between both by publishing the manual, which has one of the two backstories, on their website, and then putting the <em>other</em> backstory on the game page <em>and</em> coding it into the game itself.

<ul><li> Continuity in Western Animation is a relatively recent thing. When animation first developed, cartoonists spent far more time experimenting with the possibilities of the craft instead of telling actual narratives. And following this early experimentation and entering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheGoldenAgeOfAnimation">The Golden Age of Animation</a>, telling funny stories trumped keeping any continuity between, say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Popeye">Popeye</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a></em> shorts: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAdaptorCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UniversalAdaptorCast">Universal-Adaptor Cast</a> trope was at its height during this era, with characters living in the modern day in one short and running around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgersInTheTwentyFourthAndAHalfCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckDodgersInTheTwentyFourthAndAHalfCentury">in the 24-and-one-half century in the next</a>. Even as more serialized storytelling became more common following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnOfTheMillennium">Turn of the Millennium</a>, an overwhelming majority of non-action Western animation still makes heavy use of at least <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>. As such, most entries in this section are shows where the lack of continuity is a major source of humor or the series' identity.
</li><li> Nearly all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelixTheCat">Felix the Cat</a> cartoons and comics have no continuity at all — for starters, Felix committed suicide in his first film, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelineFollies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FelineFollies">Feline Follies</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">but is back no worse for wear in future films</a>. The Joe Oriolo era of the series is the sole exception, varying between having some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">very light continuity going on in them</a> to having no continuity at all, due to some of its episodes having story elements that completely contradict each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>: Several characters<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note08nzg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note08nzg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note08nzg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">usually not counting Quack-Quack since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">he cannot die</a>, though this still applies to him sometimes</span> have been decapitated, blown up, launched into orbit, driven to madness, turned into zombies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">trapped in alternate dimensions</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInThePast">or different time periods</a>... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The world even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow">blew up</a></span> once! Yet everything is always back to normal in the next episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogiBear">Yogi Bear</a></em> is something of a transitional phase between theatrical animation and TV animation. The earliest Yogi cartoons don't always depict him living in Jellystone Park, don't always have Boo Boo as his sidekick, and whenever Ranger Smith did show up, he wouldn't look the same from cartoon to cartoon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em>. This trope allows them to get away with, say, Frylock refusing to move back even after the others beg him to in the episode "The". There's also Shake's frequent deaths and Carl getting repeatedly mutilated/mauled. Occasional callbacks are made just for laughs, and recurring character M.C. Pee Pants' whole gag is that he <em>doesn't</em> benefit from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> and everything that happens to him sticks.
<ul><li> The best example of this would be the season 2 finale, "The Last One." The episode involves all of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Villains of the Week</a> that the Aqua Teens had faced banding together to form a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a>. This is despite the fact that some of said villains were <em>violently killed</em> by the end of whatever episode they debuted in.
</li><li> There are at least two episodes that end by skipping ahead many years and showing that the unusual circumstances of the episode have persisted (even though these circumstances are never seen in another episode). In "The Clowning", we see 67 years into the future where Carl remains a frozen clown and Meatwad remains a (non-frozen) clown. In "Multiple Meat", Meatwad is still cut into a few dozen pieces, and we see the pieces finally finish singing "3 Million Bottles of Beer on the Wall" 27 years after they started.
</li><li> Season 5 toyed with the idea of continuity in the form of a three-episode mini-arc dealing with the Aqua Teens' landlord Markula, but threw it out after that.
</li><li> "PDA" has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> occur <em>during</em> the episode, when Frylock is horrifically mangled by a giant monster, only to suddenly return to normal after he moves off-screen.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Squidbillies">Squidbillies</a></em> is created by the same folks who made ATHF, so the relentless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">Snap Back</a> is to be expected. However, here it's taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> as someone could get torn apart, and be back in full health two scenes later. There was even a point where Early shot Rusty point blank in the face with a shotgun and about 10 seconds later the skin on Rusty's face magically comes back intact off screen.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> has the episodes "Hot Water", (an episode done <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> by Cee-Lo Green, on what you should take into consideration when buying a tub...) "Tear Jerker" and "For Black Eyes Only" as officially non-canon. Though originally "Hot Water" was going to be the series finale before they got picked up for another season, so yeah...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>: Kenny's repeated deaths, for starters. Oddly, the characters are somewhat aware that Kenny's died a lot. This is occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a>. The kids' ages are also an example of this; they did at one point go from third to fourth grade, but they've been in fourth grade for close to a decade, despite going on summer break several times. Also, the 14th season episode "You have Zero Friends" revealed that the kids were born in 2001, meaning they were (retroactively) not alive for the first five seasons of the series.
<ul><li> During the Coon episodes, it is eventually stated why Kenny is always alive later.
</li><li> Some faux-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClipShow">clip shows</a> have the characters remembering past episodes <em>completely wrong</em> (such as everyone getting ice cream at the end.)
</li><li> The boys' given ages constantly vacillated between 8 and 9 after they entered fourth grade. Later episodes have them said to be 10, although this too can depend on how Parker and Stone feel when writing a script.
</li><li> In the Season 16 episode "I Should Never Have Gone Ziplining," the boys are portrayed in live action by actors in their mid-20's, which could be seen as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> given that's how old they would have been if they had aged in real time.
</li><li> In "The Return of Chef", Chef dies, and is brought back to life as Darth Chef by the end of the episode, a detail ignored in "Stunning and Brave", where he is still considered to be dead, and also, when he comes back as a zombie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SouthParkTheStickOfTruth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a></em>.
</li><li> Beginning with Season 18, each season would follow a continuous plotline with most episodes having references to the previous ones.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em>: Shorts often ended with inescapable doom, or other seemingly-permanent bad things (like the destruction of Dexter's lab on several occasions, the cast getting turned into animals or each other, or <em>the whole planet</em> getting destroyed by a huge meteor shower in "Let's Save the World, You Jerk!").
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Duckman">Duckman</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lampshaded when the character Ajax was beat up and placed in traction. He mentioned that he would be in perfect shape tomorrow due to non-FDA approved drugs.
</li><li> The amount of grievous bodily harm that Duckman puts his secretaries Fluffy and Uranus through, only for them to be back to normal by the following episode; this was lampshaded by Uranus in the first episode, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousGender">s/he</a> comments that being stuffed makes them "very resilient."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em> frequently ends with deaths/mutations/evils run amok that don't carry over to the next episode. The fan webcomic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GrimTalesFromDownBelow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GrimTalesFromDownBelow">Grim Tales from Down Below</a></em> explains this as a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTakesAHoliday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTakesAHoliday">Death Takes a Holiday</a> — Billy and Mandy's life timers ran out long ago, but Grim can't bring himself to reap them out of growing affinity... well, can't bring himself to reap <em>Mandy</em>, anyway. Billy's timer is simply so warped that he can't make heads or tails of it whether he wanted to kill him or not.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em>. Episodes have ended with Lucius falling into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a> or going insane, Miseryville being completely destroyed, characters still having to solve the episode's conflict, and so on, only for the next episode to have everything as normal. Even the geography of Miseryville is in a constant flux! There is some continuity here and there, like Beezy hooking up with Saffi, but it's really only ever brought up when convenient or funny.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>:
<ul><li> The world has been dragged trillions of miles off course and major characters have been turned into bologna or had their organs replaced with household objects, and yet virtually every episode starts as though nothing unusual has happened. Again, there are occasional callbacks.
<div class="indent"><strong>Dib:</strong> I helped you when we were turning into bologna. <br/><strong>Zim:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplausibleDeniability">YOU'RE MAKING THAT UP</a>!
</div></li><li> This naturally continues in the continuation comics, with several issues ending with events that should by all rights end the series altogether, only for things to renew with the next issue. This gets lampshaded in Issue 3, which ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicHorror">Star Donkey</a> kicking the Earth into the sun</span>... and then a "Next Time On" panel wherein Dib reminds Zim of the events of the issue, only for him to deny remembering it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers">The Angry Beavers</a></em>: A lot of the episodes end with Norbert and Daggett in a seemingly inescapable situation, or, on at least two occasions, accidentally destroying Earth. One episode had them eat a magic nut which regressed them into little kids, which later on they started devolving backwards through history, becoming (among many more things) knights, cavebeavers, then protozoa.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sealab2021" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Sealab2021">Sealab 2021</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of Sealab blowing up repeatedly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> occurs in the third episode, "Radio Free Sealab," when Marco tells Captain Murphy, "Once again, your stupidity has killed us!" before the explosion. The show also plays with this trope— some episodes reference past shows with perhaps only some characters actually remembering the event. For example, when Quinn mentions he was a robot (as revealed in an earlier season) and everyone seems surprised, Quinn explains he had told them previously. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1r1gr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1r1gr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1r1gr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The episode in question ended with everyone being killed.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> has an interesting trend in having mostly negative continuity with the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>. Characters will often comment on a previous episode's events, such as Homer's Mr. Plow job when he took off Flanders's roof to use as a snow plow, or Mr. Burns and Krusty the Clown not recognizing Homer and Bart, even if someone points out all the major things they've done to them. It doesn't usually affect the plot for that episode other than a joke.
<ul><li> <em>The Simpsons</em> have made something of an art of using a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> the <em>lack</em> of continuity.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Burns:</strong> I'm sure your replacement will be able to handle everything. Who is he, anyway? <br/><strong>Smithers:</strong> Uh, Homer Simpson, sir — one of your organ banks from sector 7-G.

</div></li><li> A similar conversation in another episode:
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Burns:</strong> Simpson, eh? New man? <br/><strong>Smithers:</strong> Actually he thwarted your campaign for governor, you ran over his son, he saved the plant from meltdown, his wife painted you in the nude... <br/><strong>Mr. Burns:</strong> Hm.

</div></li><li> Midway through Season 5's "Homer Loves Flanders", Lisa observes that, on account of Homer now being friends with Ned Flanders, something odd seems to happen to their family every week, but soon enough something happens which returns everything to normal. At the end of the episode, the main plot has not been resolved, and Homer and Flanders are still friends, causing Lisa to fear that perhaps this means it's the end of their adventures. We then flash forward to the following week's airtime ("Thursday, 8 PM") when a completely different plot is set in motion. We then see that off-camera, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">the events of the previous week's adventures have returned to normal</a> and Homer hates Flanders once again with no explanation given. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Lisa and Bart both sigh in relief.</a>
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror">Treehouse of Horror</a></em> episodes have various characters die.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2jtsz');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2jtsz" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2jtsz');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> was that all the shorts are scary stories being told by the kids, but this was quickly dropped.</span> The Halloween specials are officially non-canon, so it makes sense, though most deaths outside of that remain that way. Oddly, a clip from the first Halloween special was seen in one of the clip show episodes.
</li><li> <em>The Simpsons</em> also suffers from "continuity bubbles," where some things happen in specific years throughout the show's run while others have sliding dates in relation to the present. For example, Homer and Marge "always" graduated in 1974, even though in 2017, this would mean Marge would have had to give birth to Maggie in her early 60's; also, one episode is about Marge and Homer in college in the 90's, despite the fact that the show started in 1989 and both Homer and Marge were married and settled down with kids when it started.
</li><li> Homer was an infant during Woodstock<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3y6cm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3y6cm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3y6cm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">August 15-18, 1969</span> and a teenager during the first moon landing.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4bu9g');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4bu9g" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4bu9g');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">July 20, 1969</span>
</li><li> In "Homer the Great", Homer's birthmark is a plot point, but it does not appear in any other episode where he is visibly naked.
</li><li> In "Much Apu About Nothing", a flashback nine years into the past has Apu as a tech school graduate, while his future wife Manjula is still a young child. In "The Two Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilons", a flashback showing how Apu and Manjula's arranged marriage came to be depicts them both as children barely at eye-level with the table their parents are sitting at.
</li><li> In "Lisa the Skeptic" everyone makes a big deal about finding the skeleton of an angel. In all other episodes, supernatural beings appear briefly as gags and everyone just ignores them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AeonFlux">Æon Flux</a></em> makes a point out of not having continuity.
<ul><li> In the short episodes for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiquidTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiquidTelevision">Liquid Television</a></em>, Aeon dies every single time.
</li><li> Aeon doesn't die as often in the long episodes (she only dies in two of them, with a third that leaves her in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> situation that retains some possibility of rescue), but the authors seem to have excised almost every example of continuity. Each episode takes place in a vacuum: events, characters, and settings used in one episode will never be seen or referenced again. The exceptions are the main characters, Aeon and Trevor, the countries they live in, and a single reference to an event from a previous episode in "Chronophasia".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrawnTogether">Drawn Together</a></em> applies this trope endlessly, with characters dying several times an episode, spouses of otherwise unmarried characters showing up for one episode and then vanishing, the Earth being conquered (and all characters killed) by robot insects with hats, etc.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>, at initial glance, appears to utilize this much like <em>The Simpsons</em>, but plays with it in that broadly speaking the events of every episode are canon, with a timeline that changes according to production order almost exactly 1000 years in the future (Fry is thawed out in the beginning of the year 3000, the movie continuation takes place in 3007). The series as a whole has a continuity, an explicitly stated timeline, a canon, and a hidden <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MythArc">Myth Arc</a> that involves Nibbler and is hinted at from the <em>first episode</em>. It is still affected by negative continuity, though, in how specific details are subject to change from episode to episode.
<ul><li> Lampshaded when Fry declares that the most important thing in sitcoms is that "At the end of the episode, everything always goes right back to normal"... as the camera pulls out on the burning ruins of New New York, which is back to normal by the next episode.
</li><li> In "A Farewell to Arms", there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> to the Native Martians abandoning their homeworld in "Where the Buggalo Roam" and the planet Mars is turned desolate from a cataclysm and thrown to a new orbit between the Earth and the Sun. Nine episodes later in "Viva Mars Vegas", Mars not only still exists, habitable and in its normal place, the Natives still live there.
</li><li> The running gag of Bender claiming to be 30% or 40% of some material, which adds up to well over 100%. Then again, would <em>you</em> take <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">anything</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Bender</a> says at face-value?
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegasXLR">Megas XLR</a></em>: Not only does Coop destroy the garage (and often house) where he lives every time he takes Megas out, but he often destroys New Jersey. It's always fine the next episode. Lampshaded vaguely in an episode where Coop needs money and says: "I don't have any cash; my mom took away my allowance for wrecking the house again," and again in an episode where Coop destroys the city (again!).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CourageTheCowardlyDog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a></em>, many episodes have Eustace being turned to stone, eaten by a dragon, stuck in space, etc., or Courage turning into a helicopter, or Muriel becoming a puppet, but everything goes back to normal by the next episode. Also, villains would come back and not be remembered. One exception is the character Le Quack, where it is actually explained how he comes back and why no one recognizes him. Another exception is the "Chicken From Outer Space" from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow">What A Cartoon! Show</a></em> pilot. When he reappears again in the series proper, he still looks like a roasted chicken without a head. When he tries to remind Courage of the events of the pilot, Courage just has a look of confusion on his face. This would even be taken one step further when the Chicken's three-headed son made an appearance even later to get revenge. These episodes still played the trope straight regarding Eustace, who was disintegrated in the Chicken's first appearance and decapitated in the second.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomGoesToTheMayor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomGoesToTheMayor">Tom Goes to the Mayor</a></em>, not only has there been Tom meeting the mayor seemingly for the first time in every episode but the episode "Spray a Carpet or Rug" actually ended with Tom's suicide and subsequent descent into Hell while "Bass Fest" ended with the death of seemingly everyone <em>but</em> Tom. In both cases the next episode begins with everything back to normal. This has been somewhat explained by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">the creators</a>: Tom is stuck in a kind of Hell, and every new episode he goes to the mayor with an idea, something absolutely terrible happens to him, and everything snaps back and he gets to be tormented again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>: Very often, and frequently lampshaded.
<ul><li> For example, one episode portrays Brian as having been with the Griffin family since he was a puppy; another portrays him as having joined them after being homeless and already grown-up as a dog. Both of these were meant to be taken seriously.
</li><li> In the Rush Limbaugh episode, Chris remarks that Rush Limbaugh didn't actually exist and was a persona created by Fred Savage. When Lois questions him on it, he mentions that <em>Lois herself</em> had reported all of this when she was a FOX news anchor. Lois retorts that everything on FOX news is a lie, and true statements on FOX news retroactively become lies.
</li><li> "Secondhand Spoke" has Peter try smoking, turning his face shriveled and gray. He gives up by the end of the episode and laments that he's ready for everything <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaningOnTheFourthWall">to go back to normal</a>, only to be told that the effects of smoking will last for a long time. He asks for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingShot">Establishing Shot</a> to be played again since that "always seems to fix things", but the camera zooms back in and Peter's face is still shrivelled.
<div class="indent"><strong>Peter:</strong> Fuck. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">By next episode though he really is fine.</a></span>
</div></li><li> In later seasons, characters are dying only to be fine in the next episode.
</li><li> In "The Simpsons Guy" no one recognizes the Simpsons even though they had many brief cameos in previous episodes.
</li><li> In "Blue Harvest", a generic Rebel pilot says "Red Six standing by!" during the "All wings, report in!" scene...only for Porkins, the real Red Six from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>, to show up a couple minutes later.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> frequently had Townsville getting physically smashed or going up in flames. It was always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnapBack">perfectly fine by the next episode</a> (even though the episodes are probably very close together, since the characters never move on from kindergarten). Lampshaded (sensing a theme?) when Townsville was undergoing renovation/reconstruction, presumably from all the fights the PPG have had there.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLandBeforeTime">The Land Before Time</a></em> series is positively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/Egregious">egregious</a> in this regard, constantly resetting character traits and ignoring all the times when they finally got to paradise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead">Beavis and Butt-Head</a></em> frequently had the title characters get severely injured or their house trashed (if not completely destroyed), but everything was always fine by the next episode. Also, Mr. Van Driessen (Beavis and Butthead's teacher) survived much more painful injuries than the duo, considering he fell in a chasm during a field trip and was knocked out by government agents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHeadDoAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHeadDoAmerica">Beavis and Butt-Head Do America</a></em>. Even better, he got killed in <em>his first appearance</em>, before he was even introduced as a teacher.
<ul><li> An in-joke in the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnCanceled">Un-Canceled</a> season has Beavis and Butt-Head discussing that they used to have a friend named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a> who ended up moving away. Obviously this was an explicit reference to Daria, who indeed moved away and became the subject of her own TV series. The thing is, Daria actually had some plot progression and the show even ended with Daria and her friends splitting up and going off to college. Meanwhile, Beavis and Butt-Head have been in the same grade with the same teacher and classmates for well over 15 years at this point.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CampLazlo">Camp Lazlo</a></em>'s continuity can't make up its mind. Although a fair amount of things <em>do</em> stay with the continuity, some cases go beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>. Camp Kidney built five years ago one episode? Next episode, it's decades old. How old the camp is, how long the characters have known each other and more change from episode to episode, yet things like Edward owning a doll and Lazlo renaming the newspaper remained until the show ended. Edward being able to drive the cabins like cars was even promoted from a one-time gag to a plot element in the next season, and in the episode where the gag originated Samson sees Edward's back and comments "I see you've still got that rash", referring to a mystery rash that most of the campers came down with and showed to Samson and Raj in response to them being disgusted with their own bodies being pruned up.
</li><li> Very few things that happened in episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow">The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show</a></em> carried on into later episodes (they lived in a different place every episode), but one of the things that did get carried from episode to episode was Stimpy's first material possession (a litter box)... until it was destroyed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> had mostly a negative continuity. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">always nullified</a>, the destroyed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupervillainLair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupervillainLair">Supervillain Lairs</a> were always rebuilt, etc. The reason was admittedly that the creators didn't care much about continuity. This was however changed during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostScriptSeason">Post-Script Season</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonkeyDust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonkeyDust">Monkey Dust</a></em>. Taken to extremes. One sketch features a character that commits suicide each week. Another features a character who, every week, is released from prison after being locked up for 25 years for a crime he didn't commit.
</li><li> Every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> episode has Negative Continuity. In one, Squidward and SpongeBob were turned into snails, and in another they were turned into fruit and about to be eaten by the Flying Dutchman. Multiple times, Bikini Bottom has been crushed, blown up, and destroyed. Seems to be happening a lot less often in the newer seasons, but definitely true of the first few, at least.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HiHiPuffyAmiYumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HiHiPuffyAmiYumi">Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi</a></em>, given that the premise seemed to be to just put the characters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">antic-inducing situations for 7 minutes</a>, and then start anew in the next short. It does become a bit of a headscratcher when skills the two have acquired simply vanish, and little bits are blatantly reversed— such as Yumi's fear of squirrels in Season 1 paired with her love and devotion to squirrels in Season 2. Also Kaz's love of watching professional paint drying, contrasted with his later attitude of what a waste of time it is.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>: Thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">"Return to the Past"</a> function of the supercomupter, any injuries or problems the kids face can be easily resolved and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">status quo</a> left unchanged; the only exception is any deaths that occurred would not be undone (whether anyone actually died in some of the more dangerous situations, such as loss of gravity causing everyone to start floating into space, is up to speculation). After the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrictlyFormula">Strictly Formula</a> first season, the series decreased the use of the RTTP power by having the characters discover that constantly doing it just makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">XANA</a> stronger, leading to a shift to stronger continuity in later seasons as they began to not use it altogether. But even ignoring the literal reset button, that first season still had a bit of unexplained negative continuity, such as certain characters never being mentioned again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CountDuckula">Count Duckula</a></em>. Nearly every episode ends like this, with the castle destroyed, or having train tracks running through it, or having the characters stuck without the castle in another country and having to hitch-hike home. One episode had them complaining about this, and how it takes FOREVER to get back home.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePenguinsOfMadagascar">The Penguins of Madagascar</a></em> does this quite a bit. On the other hand, it also often takes throwaway gags in previous episodes and turns them into running gags (or devotes whole episodes to them!).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> it happens a lot:
<ul><li> The character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousSpanish">Juandissimo</a>, who is the fairy godparent of one of Timmy's enemies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonelyRichKid">Remy Buxaplenty</a>, is often shown living alone in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalLand">Fairy World</a>, then is shown living with Remy again. In the episode "Fairy Idol" (season 5) he even competes to become a fairy godparent, but in season 7 it's confirmed that he's still Remy's godparent.
</li><li> In one episode, Mr. Crocker does not recognize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">Poof</a>, who he had a bond with in "Bad Heir Day" (this happened after that episode).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em>, being a borderline <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadistShow">Sadist Show</a>, likes putting its protagonists through terrible tribulations; for example, at least two episodes end with the duo's house burned down or collapsing into the underground, and it's good as new come next episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> usually plays this trope straight in regards to their annual Halloween episodes, "Terror Tales of the Park" (think this show's version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>' famous <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TreehouseOfHorror">Treehouse of Horror</a></em>). However the third iteration of "Terror Tales" both averted and played this trope straight. The ending where the main characters get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">eaten by the possessed house</a> is not addressed at all by the next episode. However, for the next few episodes leading to the Thanksgiving special, Thomas losing a bet on Halloween is followed up on (in which he's forced to wear his "a slice of pizza" costume until Thanksgiving evening).
</li><li> Invoked for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SonicBoom">Sonic Boom</a></em>, as the creators have confirmed this is in effect, as the show is a comedy and they want to avoid limiting themselves in terms of plotlines. The only thing really canon to the show is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicBoom">the two preceding games</a>, <em>Rise of Lyric</em> and <em>Shattered Crystal</em>, happened beforehand.
<ul><li> However, the show does contain a few minor points of continuity. Most notably, in the episode "Cowbot", Eggman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">mentions</a> Dave the Intern from the previous episode "Double Doomsday", who later becomes a recurring character. He is one of several villains to do so after their introductory episode, others being the Lightning Bolt Society (including pre-established individuals like Dave the Intern and Willy Walrus), T.W. Barker and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreateYourOwnVillain">Charlie</a>.
</li><li> "Eggman Unplugged" borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade">Continuity Cavalcade</a>, with appearances by the Lightning Bolt Society and several robots such as Cowbot, who had hitherto only appeared in one episode.
</li><li> In "Just a Guy", the members of the Lightning Bolt Society explicitly reference the events of "Eggman Unplugged".
</li></ul></li><li> The season 2 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em> addresses the Negative Continuity hitherto present throughout in the show. "The Finale" focuses on the consequences of previous episodes coming back to haunt the main characters. It's the first episode to directly reference other episodes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5iinw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5iinw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5iinw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">a few second season episodes contained subtle nods but nothing major</span>, with flashbacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">Call Backs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityCavalcade">galore</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It even ends by invoking Negative Continuity. With Elmore in chaos, the angry townsfolk prepare to end the Wattersons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Gumball cries</a>: "The only thing that could save us is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">reality being completely reset</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina">some kind of magic device</a>!". The credits then roll and by the season 3 opener, everything is fine with no reference to those events being made.</span> As of its third season, the show regularly dabbles with continuity, with one episode, "The Shell", providing the first major change to the status quo<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note62s8l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note62s8l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note62s8l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">excluding the season opener, "The Kids", where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOtherDarrin">Gumball and Darwin's new voice actors take over</a></span>and "The Burden" (partly) and "The Bros" acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelEpisode">follow-ups to it</a>. Despite this, each episode remains largely standalone.
<ul><li> Confusingly, despite the end of "The Finale" invoking Negative Continuity, other events of the episode have since been referenced to in season 3. Primarily, "The Name" shows that Gumball still has memories of some of the things that happened in "The Finale" even though reality reset itself.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>:
<ul><li> Aside from the occasional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a>, the show mostly follows this trope. No matter what happens to the family or their house (or car), all is back to normal in the next episode. Notable examples include Vanzilla being destroyed in "The Sweet Spot" or the Loud kids selling all the furniture in "Come Sale Away". The only exceptions are usually the events of the full-length episodes, with "11 Louds a Leaping'" showing the faces of the Loud parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFaceless">Rita and Lynn Sr.</a> and continuing to show them afterwards, and "The Loudest Mission: Relative Chaos" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with Bobby and Ronnie Anne, Lori's boyfriend and Lincoln's secret girlfriend, moving away to live with relatives a state over, though still trying to maintain a long-distance relationship</span>.
</li><li> There have been at least three episodes that take place on April Fools Day, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp">none of the characters have aged</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TingaTingaTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TingaTingaTales">Tinga Tinga Tales</a></em> is probably by far one of the worst offenders of this trope. Every episode portrays the animal of whom the episode is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADayInTheLimelight">A Day in the Limelight</a> to be the last to have their problems fixed. For example, tick bird is not friends with hippo in her own episode, despite already being friends with her back when hippo had fur.
</li><li> Happens too many times to count in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LesShadoks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LesShadoks">Les Shadoks</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshaded</a> in the last episode of Season 3: the Shadoks and Gibis don't care about the fact that it's the end of the story and that they're going to die because by that point, they've all died so many times that they're sure they will recover from that one too.
</li><li> Canadian cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBagelAndBeckyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBagelAndBeckyShow">The Bagel and Becky Show</a></em> (about a cat-and-dog brother and sister, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtMajorBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtMajorBiology">although how so isn't explained</a>) <em>runs</em> mostly on this trope. However, certain things seem to be referenced via a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nod</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEeyore">Old Man Jenkinsbot</a> gets a new personality every time he's rebooted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">Continuity Nods</a> often (enough to warrant its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ContinuityNod/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ContinuityNod/PhineasAndFerb">page</a>), but they're rarely anything more than quick jokes before the status quo is restored.
<ul><li> Candace <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">takes note</a> of this in "Agent Doof", after her mother and several other main characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">get zapped with the Baby-Inator</a> in the final minutes. She then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakingTheFourthWall">addresses the audience</a> and says, "This better wear off before the next episode."
</li><li> Then invoked by way of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpeningNarration">Opening Narration</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerbStarWars">Phineas and Ferb: Star Wars</a></em>, which sees the show's characters inexplicably transplanted into the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Narrator:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeCrossover">None of this is canon,</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThatAudience">so just relax.</a>
