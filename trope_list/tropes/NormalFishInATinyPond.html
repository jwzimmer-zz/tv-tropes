<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SazanEyes">3×3 Eyes</a></em>, Chuui looks threatening and unstoppable only because Yakumo lacks any power or Majuu. For people like Parvati, he's a minor nuisance.
</li><li> The main character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAlchemistWhoSurvivedNowDreamsOfAQuietCityLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheAlchemistWhoSurvivedNowDreamsOfAQuietCityLife">The Alchemist Who Survived Now Dreams of a Quiet City Life</a></em> was a modestly above average alchemist before going into suspended animation who was barely getting by because alchemist was a fairly common career and she didn't have the business contacts needed to make it big. But between her suspended animation lasting generations and the disaster she went into suspended animation to escape making it impossible to create more alchemists in that region, when she wakes up she's literally the <em>only</em> alchemist around, which makes her a priceless resource for those trying to clear the local dungeons and rebuild the ruined city.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em>:
<ul><li> This happen with Mashiro's uncle, Nobuhiro "Taro Kawaguchi" Mashiro. When he's first introduced, his drawings are fairly cartoon-like, bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck">Stylistic Suck</a>, and he is said to have been ignorant of several manga drawing techniques. However, Kaya's father reveals that Nobuhiro was quite good at art compared to his classmates.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mr. Miyoshi:</strong> [Nobuhiro] always had good ideas in his head, and got good grades in art class. He was especially talented at drawing. <br/><strong>Takagi:</strong> Whaaat!? Taro Kawaguchi was good at drawing?! No way! <br/><strong>Mr. Miyoshi:</strong> He was better than the rest of us — a big fish in a small pond. <br/><strong>Mashiro:</strong> Yeah, my uncle told me he realized how bad he was only after he decided to become a professional manga artist.
</div></li><li> Ishizawa is a far cry from Mashiro's talent as an artist, although he'd like to believe the opposite is true. However, when they're both in college, it is revealed that Ishizawa has a series in Chara Kira Magazine, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">around the same time Mashiro and Takagi's first series was canceled</span>, and is looked up to by the members of the manga club.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Blame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Blame">Blame!</a></em> has Basic Safeguard exterminators. In the movie the basic exterminators are considered very dangerous robots, that keep the human population completely terrified, while in the Manga they are in fact low-level Mooks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>, Touko Nanami is easily the most talented actor on the student council, which, at her request, revives an old student council tradition of putting on a stage show for the school culture festival. After the play, Touko is scouted by a theater troupe that her student council's assistant adviser and a friend of Touko's late older sister belongs to, and realizes that compared to the other members, she's just a newbie. Touko actually doesn't mind, since she'd long felt pressure to live up to her seemingly perfect sister's example. In fact, she's relieved that her colleagues don't put her on a pedestal.
</li><li> Invoked by Mephisto in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueExorcist">Blue Exorcist</a></em>: to this point Rin has been facing small fry and had one major victory against the Impure King (by using the power of another demon to purify the decay). In order to make sure he understands that he's still in the kiddy pool Mephisto resumes the "sparring" match Rin was having with Amiamon, the weakest of the 8 Kings of Hell, only this time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IAmNotLeftHanded">Amiamon burns out his human shell to show his demonic powers</a>.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACentaursLife">A Centaur's Life</a></em> during the marathon; while protagonist Hime can run 100m in about 9 seconds (as fast as or faster than our own current world record holder, Usain Bolt), when she tries actually <em>racing</em> she's left lagging massively behind the other competitors. This is because, as the title suggests, Hime is a <em>centaur,</em> so while she can leave all her bipedal friends eating the dust of her hooves, compared to professional runners of her own race she's a slowpoke.
<ul><li> Later, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hime finds herself stranded in a medieval fantasy world. Except, her centaur strength, atomic-age education, and partly-horse appearance give her the skills she needs to masquerade as an angel from the heavens and take command of an entire kingdom of ordinary humans</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>:
<ul><li> Touma himself acknowledges that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Imagine</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier">Breaker</a> is useless if there are no superpowered beings around. In Academy City or the Magic Side, he's practically unbeatable. Faced with average street thugs or gunmen, and he's just a regular guy who can street fight.
</li><li> Accelerator is another prime example. Before his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DePower">De-Power</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and subsequent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">multiple powerups</a></span> he was unaccountably strong in Academy City, to the point where his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">would-be assassins killed themselves on his passive defenses without him even realizing he'd been attacked.</a> Conversely, for much of the series he is entirely vulnerable to magic attacks and from their perspective is no more able to defend himself than anybody else.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Among Shinigami, Ryuk is actually mid- to low-ranked. However, he's still a being that can kill any human by writing their name in the Death Note, no matter how manipulative or intelligent they are <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">including the protagonist Light, whom he eventually kills out of boredom</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisappearanceOfNagatoYukiChan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheDisappearanceOfNagatoYukiChan">The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan</a></em> Ryoko Asakura is one of the best students at North High, but she finds herself unable to answer a math question that her peers at Koyoen Academy are studying at the same time, since the latter is a prep school that covers more material.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the arc immediately after Goku and Piccolo are established as the two strongest on Earth, we find out this is mostly because they're from alien species <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunyEarthlings">that are naturally much, much stronger than humans.</a> By standards of their own species, Goku was weak for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Saiyan</a> and Piccolo average for a Namekian, while both were weak compared to the average intergalactic warrior (though in Piccolo's case, he is technically still half of who he really is at this point and is actually a Super Namekian, having large amounts of combat potential). This is then subverted, as within two years <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyKungFuIsStrongerThanYours">they are both far stronger than anyone of their kind has EVER been.</a>
</li><li> Raditz is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mook</a> of Frieza's, but on Earth, he easily pulls off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletCatch">Bullet Catch</a> against a shotgun-wielding farmer and is powerful enough to curb-stomp both Goku and Piccolo, the two strongest beings on the planet, simultaneously, forcing Goku to pull off a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to take him down. In fact, when they discover that Vegeta and Nappa consider Raditz a pathetic weakling compared to them, the Z-Fighters are in disbelief.
<div class="indent"><strong>Nappa</strong>: Yeah, I getcha! Raditz, that chicken weakling, let himself be fooled by the power readings! <br/><strong>Piccolo</strong>: Raditz was a <em>weakling</em>?!
</div></li><li> The concept is also consistently used for training; characters will train in harsh, high-gravity environments so that they'll be even stronger under normal conditions. Vegeta eventually works up to training in a chamber that generates 500 times Earth's gravity (or 50 times his own home planet's gravity).
</li><li> This gets a humorous nod in the Buu Saga when Babidi's minion Pui-Pui brings the heroes to his home planet, thinking they'll be crushed by its gravity, which is 10 times greater than Earth's. Unfortunately for the poor sod, Vegeta <em>also</em> comes from a 10G planet, and everyone in the room regularly trains in conditions of far more than that.
</li><li> Freeza's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> are easily curb-stomped by the heroes, but they are still magnitudes more powerful than regular humans and can easily conquer planets who don't have superpowered defenders. They can also be considered an inversion, being that most were chosen for being the most powerful beings of their respective planets.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, the title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JacoTheGalacticPatrolman">Jaco the Galactic Patrolman</a></em> is way stronger than any human, easily lifting weights of multiple tonnes, casually jumping at enormous heights and running at incredible speeds, and killing a giant ship-sinking shark with <em>one punch <strong>underwater</strong></em>, but flat-out admits that the aliens who have sent one of their own to attack Earth are way stronger, and that he can kill the invader only if he's still a child. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">As this is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPrequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthPrequel">Stealth Prequel</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> and the invader is Goku, this shouldn't surprise anyone.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GargantiaOnTheVerdurousPlanet">Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet</a></em>, Ledo is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">ordinary soldier</a> among his peers, piloting a mass-produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealRobotGenre">Real Robot</a>. Until he finds himself stranded on a long forgotten, far less advanced Earth. It's no surprise every time he fights the local hostiles with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobotGenre">mecha</a>, it ends up being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> Naruto and Sasuke had pretty much established themselves as pretty strong genin...until Haku showed up, seemingly killed Zabuza with a flick of the wrist, and disappeared without a second notice. When they try to fight him again, Haku reveals he had been holding back (and holds back through the <em>entire</em> fight). The only challenge he gets is from Naruto's first use of Kurama's chakra. And even then, it's only because Haku doesn't go in for the kill he's taking a beating. This becomes even more apparent when Orochimaru and even more villages are introduced, and it takes a LOT of training from Naruto to catch up to Gaara or Neji in Part I and surpass the latter. By the tail end of Part II, though, Naruto and Sasuke are quite clearly among the strongest ninja in the world.
</li><li> Likewise, Sakura is praised for her chakra control but as she learns during the Chuunin Exam, most of the participants have control roughly as good (if not better) and are far superior to her in every other aspect.
</li><li> Jiriaya, and to an extent the other Sannin, (Orichimaru and Tsunade) are large fish in a normal pond, being incredibly strong ninja in their own right, but they only managed to get into a draw against someone like Hanzo in their prime (this was back when they were a team) and then there are those like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysABiggerFish">Nagato</a> (who easily annihilated Hanzo). Jiraiya's final thoughts are to compare himself to a frog in a well that has made it to the ocean (referencing a Japanese proverb similar to this trope). Granted, being ninja, power isn't always the thing. Nagato mentions that had Jiraiya been aware of his capabilities, he would've most likely lost, implying only the element of surprise allowed him to beat Jiraiya despite having more abilities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> This comes up several times, where characters, usually one-shot, are hyped up as the strongest in whatever nation or island the story is taking place in at the time, only to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">Worfed</a> by a more worldly, and therefore more powerful, fighter. Zoro had this happen to himself in his "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">epic duel</a>" with Mihawk at the Baratie; despite being the most infamous swordsman and bounty hunter in the East Blue, Mihawk makes short work of him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Mihawk:</strong> You may have a reputation, but you're still just a bunny. [...] You're a little frog, croaking in your puddle. Time you learned how big the world is.
</div></li><li> Mihawk's presence in the story itself, when he effortlessly defeats not only Zoro, but Don Krieg, one of the strongest pirates in East Blue, also references this. By the time the protagonists head for the Grand Line, they are the strongest pirate crew in East Blue. But as the pirates from East Blue are considered weaker than the other seas, almost all of their opponents to come are more dangerous than anyone in East Blue.
</li><li> Luffy himself runs up against this obstacle in both powers and experience. The majority of his opponents in the East Blue were overall less familiar and less equipped to deal with a devil fruit user. Luffy therefore tended to win more easily compared to many of his later opponents on the Grand Line. On the Grand Line itself, Devil Fruits themselves tend to be more frequent and varied making Luffy's own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RubberMan">gomu gomu fruit</a> look more mundane and weak (at least until Luffy trains it more).
</li><li> This was called back to after Zoro trained under Mihawk during the timeskip. His first "serious opponent", a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkenMaster">Drunken Master</a> octopus swordsman, bragged about being the strongest swordsman in Fishman Island. Zoro kept calling him a frog, until the swordsman was sufficiently incensed, at which point Zoro stated he was bragging like a frog in a well, unaware of the world.
</li><li> Pretty much the New Fishman Pirates in their entirety. They take over Fishman Island (and even that requires them to beef up on Energy Steroids), but the Straw Hats easily defeat them.
</li><li> Arlong was one of the elite members of Fisher Tiger's crew, but not necessarily all that powerful compared to the rest of the Grand Line (and at least some of his former crewmates were substantially stronger than him as well), especially when he loses to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vice-Admiral Borsalino (future Marine Admiral Kizaru)</span>. However, when he arrived in East Blue, he conquers multiple islands unopposed, largely on the basis that he's from the Grand Line, and he's more than a match for the East Blue Marine forces that try to oppose him, since the best ones are stationed in the Grand Line.
</li><li> Bellamy the Hyena had the largest bounty in the area he had made base at, and was all too happy to gloat about it and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster">taunt and rough up the Straw Hats</a> because they didn't want any trouble. When he sees Luffy's newest bounty come in, he panics a little before convincing himself the bounty's a fake. When Luffy picks a fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">seething with pure fury</a> over Bellamy roughing up their new friend Montblanc Cricket and ransacking his house, Bellamy accepts and goes through a long charge up with his Devil Fruit that makes him so fast he can't be seen... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">then Luffy sends him through the docks in one strike</a>.
</li><li> Downplayed with Eneru. He is much stronger than anybody on the Sky Islands, and he has an almost unbeatable Devil Fruit power (he can create and turn himself into lightning). In fact, Luffy only defeats him because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">his rubber body cannot conduct electricity</a>, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation">Haki</a> allows him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatClairvoyance">predict his opponents' moves</a> that made the fight with him pretty damn close. The general consensus is that he is one of the strongest characters in the series. However, when Luffy fights him, he (Luffy) comments that Eneru may be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> in the sky, but on the Blue Sea there are so many strong guys that Eneru will look like a weakling. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Oda has also said</a> that if Eneru ever descended to the blue sea, he would be wanted as a very dangerous criminal. To clarify, he possesses the Rumble Rumble Fruit, which is explicitly referred to as the one of the Logia-classed Fruits which grants <strong>virtual invincibility</strong>. However, between the fact that Haki users can nullify Devil Fruit powers and the existence of at least one Paramecia (the Quake-Quake Fruit) that exceeds the Rumble Fruit in power, that advantage isn't enough. That said, with Eneru having Haki of his own and being surprisingly smart despite his insanity, he would've been a major player anywhere he went.
</li><li> Many Logia users, people able to transform, either partially or completely, into an element or thing (Smoker becoming smoke), can see the first half of the Grand Line as their very large "tiny pond" as any person or crew who survives in the latter half is going to be trained in Haki, ki attacks which nullify the advantage of becoming one's element and allows them to sustain damage.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSmoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSmoke">Captain Smoker</a> qualified before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>. While he was certainly badass, he was also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Intangibility">Logia user</a> stationed in the weakest sea then later in the first half of the Grand Line. Neither sea has many (or any for the East Blue) people even capable of touching him, let alone fighting. However, one guy on what seems to be on a whim stopped over at East Blue to see how his son was doing, and make Smoker quake in his boots without physically doing anything to him. Said man was admittedly later revealed as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The World's Most Wanted Man</a>" Dragon the Revolutionary.
</li><li> When New World pirate Pekoms, whose Devil Fruit power is a lowly turtle Zoan (with rare exceptions like mythical beasts, Zoans are generally regarded as the weakest Devil Fruit users, and herbivorous Zoans are the weakest of all) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomps</a> swamp Logia Caribou, he gives the advice that Logias who rely exclusively on their Devil Fruit will die quickly in the New World.
</li><li> Which is driven home later on later on with the next <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> Caesar Clown, a logia-type who has control over all types of chemical gas, including poisons. Pre-time skip he would have been one of the most dangerous opponents the Straw Hats faced <em>period</em>, but coming out of two years of training (not to mention Luffy having developed an incredible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredPoisonImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcquiredPoisonImmunity">Acquired Poison Immunity</a> and Haki which let him strike Caesar through his Logia form) once Caesar can't run or spring traps and is forced into a straight up fight, Luffy makes him look like an utter chump. Also notable in that Caesar is currently the only Logia that's been a major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Arc Villain</a> since the time skip, with Doflamingo and Big Mom being Paramecia-type fruit users, and Kaido being a Zoan.

He's legitimately strong and would fit into the lower ranks of S-Class perfectly, but he's limited his world view to what he sees in the tournament ring. Fighting only people much weaker than him has blinded him to just how many monsters and heroes out there are stronger than him. He finally understands this once he fights the Dragon-level <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeniusBruiser">Gouketsu</a> and realizes that for all his strength, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchPunchPunchUhOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchPunchPunchUhOh">he can't make the monster even blink</a> (for context, "Dragon" threats are among the most powerful opponents in the world and only surpassed by "God"-level ones. Even monsters on the rank below it, "Demon", are dangerous enough that even a low-ranked S-Class Hero can lose).
</li><li> Fubuki and her posse are the top-ranked B-class heroes, and she thinks she's being extremely generous in deigning to invite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyInvincibleHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicallyInvincibleHero">Saitama</a> and Genos into her group. Then when she goes to see him, she sees him hanging out with S-Classes who defer to him and has a small moment of panic. In fact, Fubuki herself is well aware of this; she's strong enough that she could easily be an A-Rank hero, but she believes she isn't strong enough to beat the top-ranked A-Class Hero Sweet Mask (who himself is strong enough to be S-Class) and her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pride">Pride</a> won't let her be second-best, so she stays at B-Class.
</li><li> Sweet Mask himself stays in the A-Rank even though he could be S-Class because he considers himself to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThresholdGuardians">Threshold Guardian</a> of sorts for other Heroes hoping to become S-Class.

<ul><li> This applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Momonga</a> upon his arrival to the New World. In YGGDRASIL, the MMO he was transported from, Momonga was one of hundreds, if not thousands, of players to reach the level 100 cap, and he himself specifically mentions that his current build was designed more for roleplaying than for PvP purposes (although he does have more than twice the standard maximum amount of spells thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Class</a>). Against a foe with a similar level and a more PvP focused build he would find himself severely outclassed (though not entirely without a chance of victory, such as against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shalltear</span>). Once he shows up in the New World where the level cap is <em>much</em> lower, and his instant death spells that would normally be ineffective against other players work just fine against just about anything this world has to offer, suddenly there's a nigh unbeatable lich overlord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbstompBattle">stomping</a> on everything left and right.
</li><li> Quickly subverted when it's revealed Momonga was (and remains) in control of a top ten guild from YGGDRASIL, which had (and still has) possession of the most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">World</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Class</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameChanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameChanger">Items</a>.

He lead his guild on several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable">Defeating the Undefeatable</a> quests without suffering a single loss, and regularly defeated much stronger opponents in PvP because of his intricate knowledge of game mechanics... plus a few hundred dollars in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">cash items</a>. In fact, Momonga renames himself to the guild's name because it was so famous in YGGDRASIL that <em>ANYONE</em> who played it should immediately recognize it. Such fame was intended to help him reunite with his former guild mates if they traveled to the fantasy world. Momonga however does not believe he is the strongest in the New World and spends much of the series trying to expand his power base in preparation for future foes who may be able to challenge him.
</li><li> He's able to go around in disguise as a warrior because his strength stat is so high. He has no technique, and the Martial Arts people use (sort of like an extensive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buff</a> system) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">can't be learned by YGGDRASSIL-ians</span>.

</li><li> Magic is divided into ten tiers. A human able to cast Second-teir spells is considered an accomplished mage and those able to cast third-tier magic are mages to be taken seriously. In fact most people cannot learn anything higher due to their low level cap. The fourth-tier is very rare and the expectation for the handpicked students of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheArchmage">The Archmage</a>, and fifth-tier being the domain of legendary heroes. The only living person even known to cast Sixth-tier magic is said Archmage himself; the hundreds of years old Fluder Paradyne. Seventh-tier magic is only known to be cast by the highly advance Slain Theocracy in massive city wide rituals. Tenth-tier magic is entirely hypothetical, as it's only known through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">Tome of Eldritch Lore</a>. For the serious Yggdrasil PvPer such as Ainz, magic below the Eighth-tier was broadly considered too weak for any real combat. Ainz can cheerfully cast tenth-tier and above (called super-tier, which can only be cast a few times a day) spells, and many times he obliterates the opposition by overestimating them and breaking out the big guns.

The town was renamed in his honor, he had a statue placed for him in the center of town, and his grandsons became the town's mayor, postmaster, and famous Professor/local eccentric scientist. His ranking out of a thousand: 921. The conflict between the higher executives vision and the vision of Shudo, said head writer, never did get to a point of addressing if Ash or Gary ever ranked higher than 921, and if such the town would have been renamed Ashburg or Garyville.
<ul><li> Although it's notable <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation">Pocket Monsters: The Animation</a></em> breaches <em>heavily</em> into alternate continuity, as well as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism">far more cynical than the anime</a>, basically to the point of deconstruction. Among massive changes are Pallet Town's visible poverty and criminal problems, Gym Leaders losing their license after <em>any</em> 4 consecutive losses to challengers, and Gym Leaders bribing challengers to not lose (greatly contradicting how Misty's sisters basically gave up badges without any worry), Brock's father not appearing, and his siblings having various fathers, Ash never getting a Bulbasaur, Charmander and Squirtle. So it's doubtful how canonical to the anime concepts in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/PocketMonstersTheAnimation">Pocket Monsters: The Animation</a></em> light novels are, if at all, especially seeing Takeshi Shudo himself used Charmander/Charmeleon/Charizard in multiple episodes and movies he directly wrote. So the revelation of the strongest trainer to ever come out of Pallet Town being quite weak in the grand scale just seems to be another part of the light novel being more cynical and deconstructive towards the anime and the franchise.

It's eventually subverted, as Sanosuke becomes strong enough to hold his own even if he's not quite as powerful.
</li><li> This trope is half the primary joke of the light novel/manga series ''Suppose A Kid From The Last Dungeon Boonies Moved To A Starter Town". Lloyd Belladonna is the weakest man in the village of Kunlun, and knows it. But when he leaves his small mountain town and moves to the big city, it turns out that he's only weak by the standards of Kunlun. In RPG terms, he's level 60 and thinks he's weak because everyone he grew up with has already reached level 75 or higher, and now lives in a place where the previous strongest man in town was level 10. The other half of the primary joke is that he honestly doesn't understand this, and thinks that the incredible feats he's able to pull off from being so overpowered for the area are just routine tasks, to the amazement of everyone else who sees him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoWarOnGeminar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyoWarOnGeminar">Tenchi Muyo: War on Geminar</a></em>, Kenshi Masaki says he was a weakling and idiot compared to his more famous brother Tenchi and Tenchi's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedHarem">Unwanted Harem</a>...which is true given that some of them are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical Gods</a>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em>, the chapter that introduced the Four Beast explained that some of the Human World's most dangerous beasts are merely the ones who were too weak to compete in the Gourmet World. The text then mentions that the Four Beast is an exception, since it came to the Human World because it preferred to eat humans.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheUselessSenpaiAndTheTalentedKouhai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheUselessSenpaiAndTheTalentedKouhai">The Useless Senpai and The Talented Kouhai</a></em>, Tsukioka, the eponymous taleted kouhai, is a downplayed case of this. She's a talented basketball player, but Ochiai, the useless senpai, remarks that their school's team is rather weak, so Tsukioka stands out all the more easily.

In our time, an Aegis destroyer is merely a small part of the war machine. In WW2, it's powerful enough even by itself that it can change the course of the war. Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinalCountdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFinalCountdown">The Final Countdown</a></em>, the key moral question is whether it should.

</li><li> Mr Mxyzptlk, the imp who occasionally pops over from the Fifth Dimension to bug Superman, was said in his first appearance to be a nobody in his home dimension, where his powers are nothing out of the ordinary.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBatman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanBatman">Superman/Batman</a></em> story "Torment", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheScarecrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheScarecrow">The Scarecrow</a> betrays Desaad and sprays him with fear toxin, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">it has no effect</a>. Desaad angrily points out that just because he's a wimp compared to most superheroes and supervillains doesn't change the fact that he's a <em>god</em>.

In fact, his crazy uncle Baal is said to have much greater power than him and he can be put on a spell even by young and inexperienced female Warlock (as they are by default more powerful than males) and the only thing that makes him special is being in the possession of the Sword Sinister, through it's unexplained why. Compared to humans and other races he is however seen almost as a godlike being and Galaxy's only hope against the Termight Empire.
</li><li> Mister Miracle is generally depicted as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnicalPacifist">Technical Pacifist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Guile Hero</a>.

Nor does he (usually) have the flashy energy powers some New Gods have, physically hes just an average New God. Which means he could rip the average human apart like damp cardboard if he wanted to.
</li><li> There was a series of one-shot comics in the late 1990's called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JustImagineStanLeeCreatingTheDCUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JustImagineStanLeeCreatingTheDCUniverse">Just Imagine... Stan Lee Creating the DC Universe</a></em>. The "Superman" adaptation was an alien cop named Saldan, a normal guy who ended up chasing a serial killer into an experimental spacecraft and ending up on Earth. Saldan discovered Earth's gravity was absurdly weak and human language was childishly simple, allowing him to settle in pretty effortlessly as a popular superhero. Solar energy wasn't a factor — like Siegal and Schuster's early concept of Superman, Saldan was just built for a much harsher world in which he was considered normal.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vampirella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Vampirella">Vampirella</a></em>'s Warren years she was an inhabitant of the planet Drakulon and never said to be particularly powerful for one of them. That still made her superpowered compared to humans.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAtom">Captain Atom</a></em> is generally considered a second-tier hero at best in the mainstream DC Universe, however, when he is transported to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Wildstorm">WildStorm</a></em> universe, he proves to be almost unstoppable, all but casually walking through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>, that world's mightiest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">"heroes"</a>. Of course, part of this is that Captain Atom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillfullyWeak">holds back</a> a <em>lot</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em> has a huge bodycount for a non-powered hero. However, this is mostly because he deals with street-level criminals, non-powered ones and low-powered ones— they have just enough guns and muscles to intimidate civilians and run rackets, but are completely out of their depth against a trained soldier who hates them personally. This applies to both the superhumans he kills (e.g. one of the Vultures, who was strong but <em>not</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>... or knives) and the regular thugs (who are unarmored, usually only carrying handguns, and have no combat training or relevant experience). When higher level superheroes/villains get on his case, his plan almost always involves distracting/hobbling them so he can run away, having no chance against them (though he does try to kill the villainous ones). That said, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherKillsTheMarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherKillsTheMarvelUniverse">The Punisher Kills the Marvel Universe</a></em> exists...

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> For Marvel world standards, Spider-Man is not that special, being overshadowed by many superheroes like Thor, Hercules or Hulk. But by street-level standards, Spider-Man is one of the most powerful heroes, being a Lightning bruiser capable of lifting tanks and surprising Daredevil with his speed.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Venom">Venom</a></em>:
<ul><li> As Venom, Brock never fared that well when he branched out and fought other heroes (Darkhawk, Daredevil and Seige, Iron Man, Quasar, etc.) besides Spider-Man, who he was a nightmare for due to being more powerful, knowing his secret identity, and being immune to his Spider Sense. The Amazing Spider-Man #317 includes a scene where Eddie visits an oblivious Aunt May as a means of intimidating Pete into no longer asking for help from any of his superfriends like the Fantastic Four, making it clear that if Pete won't keep their feud just between the two of them, then he won't either. Averted during his stints as Toxin and Anti-Venom, where he can kick a lot of ass. Mac Gargan and Flash Thompson also never ran into this problem, presumably because they already were an experienced supervillain and soldier, respectively. In his second stint as Venom, he has so far not really run into this problem, presumably owing to the Symbiote being more powerful and Brock being more experienced.
</li><li> Lampshaded in Venom Annual #1, where a group of villains at the Bar with No Name tell each other Venom stories. Black Cat speaks of how she once got the jump on him and kicked him into an exploding car, the bartender speaks of how Venom once fought Wolverine, who mocked him for picking only on Spider-Man and got the better of him in that particular bout, and lastly a third patron speaks of how Venom once went toe-to-toe with Juggernaut - while claiming the entire time that Venom was out of his depth and got curb-stomped, although the actual flashback shows Venom fending him off. Mac Gargan  who once was Venom himself, mind you  starts outright mocking Venom and asking why anything he just heard should give him the scares. Then it turns out the third patron was Venom in disguise and he sends the bar's entire patronage running for their lives. Mac Gargan is not amongst the lucky ones, with the ending of the issue implying that Venom ate him, though later it would be revealed that he survived.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This is essentially the premise for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkMillar">Mark Millar</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel1985" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Marvel1985">Marvel 1985</a></em>, in which Marvel supervillains begin appearing in our worldbut no heroes. In a world without super-powers or super-science, even a guy like Stilt-Man can be a terror.

Dresden is, in his world, a supernatural middle-weight. While he's got a lot of raw power for a human wizard, he's half a century or more from his magical prime, there's a <em>lot</em> that he doesn't know, his magical stamina is likewise a work in progress, and in his world, human wizards are hindered by the Laws of Magic and are nowhere <em>near</em> the top of the tree for raw power (they tend to do their best work when they have time to prepare). However, he's now in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">Low Fantasy</a> world where his abilities make him a fully fledged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonOfMassDestruction">Person of Mass Destruction</a> - and that's before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his powers as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningBruiser">the Winter Knight</a> re-emerge, and make him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a></span>.

This trope is also played straight, though, as the protagonist comes from our world, which has no magic. Thusly, when he goes to other worlds that <em>do</em> have magic, he isn't hurt by magical attacks at all. He can still be hurt or killed by magical side effects, such as the heat of a fireball causing his clothes to burn or to boil water he's drinking.

Trhvmn Ortenrosse is a stronger Dead Apostle Ancestor, but isn't comparable in power to the top 10 (his strongest point being he's not a Squishy Wizard like most other Dead Apostle Ancestors). When they find themselves together fighting against a Nightmare Factory branch, they casually tear through their forces without even trying. Then the Nightmare Factory tries his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a>-inducing nightmares... At which point Ortenrosse <em>takes offence they tried to scare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilerThanThou">those who cause nightmares to the scariest things on the planet</a></em>, and wipes them out. Remember, neither of them is even close to be the strongest or scariest of the Dead Apostle Ancestors.
<ul><li> It's worth pointing out that when the bullet above says that most Dead Apostle Ancestors are Squishy Wizards it says it for Dead Apostle Ancestors standards: every single Dead Apostle Ancestor is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">hellishly difficult to damage for anyone who is not in their league</a> thanks to their <em>enormous</em> magical power, and even then they have an absolutely <em>ludicrous</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> (whenever they're wounded, their Curse of Restauration turns the body back in time to just before they were wounded. The strongest the Dead Apostle or similar vampiric creature is, the greater the damage they can heal this way). The reason Enhance and Ortenrosse make the others look Squishy is that they were very physically strong to begin with before being turned, what with the former being former military and the latter being from the Greece of the Heroic Age (when <em>everyone</em> had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBuild">Heroic Build</a> and knew how to use it).

At the same time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Minako Aino</a> muses that Sailor Moon at her first outing could have fought a dozen of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> and won, and that she alone would have probably wiped them out.

<ul><li> Several of The Forsaken from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em> series have shades of this. In The Age of Legends, when the Forsaken were born, Traveling (the ability to cross great distances in a single step) was commonplace and Balefire (a spell that destroys a target then erases their actions several moments backwards in time) was used as a tool of war by both them and their enemies. Fast forward 3000 years and several nigh-apocalyptic wars and Traveling and Balefire are both mostly forgotten skills. When The Forsaken step back into the flow of time these abilities which they take for granted suddenly make these channelers (all of whom were the most powerful of their day to begin with) into extremely powerful and dangerous individuals.
<ul><li> It's also mentioned that channelers are born weaker and in lower numbers with each generation following the Age of Legends, believed to be a result of those that <em>are</em> born failing to breed (because the men go insane and either kill themselves or get hunted down, and the women get whisked away to the all-female Aes Sedai and don't have kids). Most Aes Sedai in the modern age would have been unexceptional in the past, save for those born in remote, neglected areas where the old blood runs stronger. Nynaeve would have been exceptional even for a female channeler in the past, and is capable of going toe to toe with many of the Forsaken.
</li><li> Another aspect of the apparently lesser power of modern channelers is that female channelers tend to be much weaker than male channelers, much as women tend to be much less physically powerful than men. As all modern male channelers go insane at a fairly early age, channelers mostly appear to be much weaker. Male channelers tend to be horribly powerful by comparison, and only a few women, such as Nynaeve, stand any chance against them - and a strong male channeler like Rand makes even her feel like a kitten in comparison.

The sphere is not particularly special in his own world, but his ability to intersect himself with Flatland quite easily makes him a god there.

Donal, being only half-breed Dorsai, spent his youth focusing on his strategic and marksmanship skills, because he couldn't compete in strength or toughness. Then he ventured out into the wider galaxy, where he discovered that his one failing - his "puny" physique - was still exceptional among the non-Dorsai masses.

The sighted man expects to be able to awe the blind natives and rule over them, unfortunately, in a society built by and for blind people, sight is actually a <em>disadvantage</em> (everyone works at night and houses have no windows, for starters). The sighted man is shunned until he considers blinding himself to better fit in.

Then he is cruelly lectured by his trainer and fellow gladiators that the only reason why he looked so strong was because his fellow villagers, the raiders, and his handpicked opponents were weak, and he is shown his place in the pecking order by Crixus beating the snot out of him. Spartacus slowly improves his strength and skill through grueling training and experience in the arena, until he is no longer this trope and is truly an elite warrior.
</li><li> When Ashur joins the Romans, he proves a point about the Romans underestimating the Rebels by admitting that he was mocked as the weakest of the gladiators, yet he is able to beat four Roman soldiers to near death.

<ul><li> The Imperial Guard's lasgun's reputation as a flashlight comes from the fact that it's one of the weakest weapons on the main tabletop game despite being able to take off a human's arm, due to how stupidly destructive other weapons are (the Imperium's other iconic weapon, the bolter, is essentially a fully automatic miniature rocket-powered-grenade launcher that first impact then explode, making it as devastating against unarmored humans as light vehicles).
</li><li> Flak armor, the "default" body armor for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedshirtArmy">Imperial Guardsman</a>, is high-tier in games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Necromunda">Necromunda</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DarkHeresy">Dark Heresy</a></em>, and a "standard" Space Marine from the main ruleset can serve as an army-smashing boss monster in a smaller-scale game.
</li><li> Any technology from before the current time of the setting is bound to be placed in a much more powerful role than it probably had in the past. Consider the Baneblade superheavy tank; in "modern" 40k it is a massive block of armor and guns that can annihilate squads of vehicles and infantry with its massive amount of firepower, but is rare enough that most Guard Regiments will never see one in their entire operational lifetimes. Its blueprints (which predate the Imperium by millennia) list it as a <em>light</em> tank, meaning in the past it was the tank equivalent of cannon fodder.

They were one of the two factions that destroyed Earth and continue to aggressively hound human refugees on Mira. Fighting them off is a struggle and they're easily winning a war of attrition for most of the game. It's later revealed that the Ganglion are actually a criminal syndicate - and not even a major one, they're the space equivalent of thugs the real players use as hired muscle. That's just what happens when a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HigherTechSpecies">Higher-Tech Species</a> decide to pick on a race still figuring out spaceflight.

As a veteran of the previous war his skill and strength far exceeds the local inexperienced freedom fighters and the weak soldiers Begnion bothered to occupy Daein with, which manifests in gameplay as him starting out as an already promoted unit with high base stats while he is fighting amongst a bunch of unpromoted units with comparitively weak stats. His class line of a thief though means that he is rather weak compared to trained soldiers, and as such his class has substantially worse stat caps and combat abilities than other class lines, which has him fall off significantly later on in the game when fighting against elite armies in all-out war and goddess-powered enemies. He even lampshades that he doesn't really belong when fighting the endgame bosses.

In their home universes, they're considered powerful, but not overly so... about a middle tier threat at best. In <em>Monster Hunter</em>, they're treated as top level threats that require multiple elite hunters to deal with, largely because the hunters have no magical abilities and have no experience fighting beings that can command magic. And in the Leshen's case, it's stated that the <em>Monster Hunter</em> world has a far greater amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeEnergy">Life Energy</a>, meaning the Leshen, as a nature spirit, is much more powerful there than it is in its home universe.

<ul><li> However, it turns out the Ricks are kinda wrong, as shown in the comics. J19Z7 Rick does not come from a "doofus" universe, but some sort of opposite universe, hence why "Doofus Rick" is the only nice and non self-loathing Rick. Compare this with J19Z7 <em>Jerry</em>. This being the mirror verse, this Jerry is a ruthless, ambitious, intelligent and powerful man who is the richest of the world, practically controlling it, and upon discovering the multiverse, proceeds to beat Ricky and Morty multiple times and <em>takes over</em> the Council of Ricks with the intent of multiversal conquest.

While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> at the end of the episode is that he's actually a scrawny guy with a beer gut wearing a muscle suit to look stronger than he is, he <em>is</em> still strong enough to take out a pair of robots with relative ease. His problem is that he's completely full of himself; since he's the strongest person in the area he lives in, he let his ego soar to the point he believed he's the strongest in the world. His first inkling that this isn't the case is when he challenges Jack, who is so much stronger that, even simply using a bamboo stick in their duel, he still completely outclasses Da Samurai in, effectively, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">two moves</a>.

While on Earth, Donnie's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a>, he soon finds himself overshadowed by Professor Honeycutt, discovering that Earth is about 3000 years behind the standard transdimensional concepts of physics and he's effectively a "galactic idiot" in comparison.
</li><li> According to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em>, E.T. is actually a retard when compared to his people (who intentionally dumped him on Earth to get rid of him); he has a stunted body, can't speak properly (the others use proper English) and "only has one glowing finger".
</li><li> The original premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsRebels">Star Wars Rebels</a></em> was that it was following a single rebel cell on the backwater planet Lothal, to show a microcosm of how the rebellion against the Empire is playing out at the local level. Season 1 takes place about five years before <em>A New Hope</em>, so there is no formal "Rebel Alliance" yet. The group we follow is really just four or five people on one ship...one of whom was a former Jedi Padawan who managed to escape Order 66 by luck. Given that this is just a backwater planet, however, the local Imperial garrison doesn't really have that much to throw at them: it's considered significant when a <em>light escort cruiser</em> attacks them, and it's a season finale cliffhanger when an Imperial-class Star Destroyer shows up. This element of the show was gradually lost as each season advanced, though justified in that the war was escalating: by the final season they were having full scale fleet battles.

<ul><li> In a sense, the Roman Empire was this in terms of civilization after they had successfully conquered all land around the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean Sea was a cradle of countless civilizations prior to Classical Antiquity and by extension the Middle Ages. However, when compared with the vastness of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, it simply isn't as valuable an economic hub on a global scale. So in essence, the Mediterranean sea was the Tiny Pond compared to the Atlantic and Pacific's Normal Pond.
</li><li> Ecologically, this trope occurs a lot with invasive species. When an organism is suddenly placed in an environment similar to its native range, but without any of the natural predators, competitors, and illnesses that normally kept it in check, it will end up <em>dominating</em> the new region, generally at the expense of many native organisms which have never encountered this species before and therefore have no defences against it. This is particularly common on island ecosystems, where regular animals like cats, toads, goats, or ants can become incredibly destructive.
</li><li> Small numbers of soldiers from advanced civilizations, forces that wouldn't really be considered relevant in wars against peer adversaries back home, can easily end up conquering entire states of less advanced civilizations despite numerical inferiority thanks to their superior technology and organization. A prime example is the Portuguese wars in India. At the <a class="urllink" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=kNzCDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=warfare+and+armed+conflicts+a+statistical+encyclopedia+of+casualty&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiK9qiH4cjnAhWpFjQIHVgsDrAQ6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=goa&amp;f=false">1511 conquest of Goa<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, for instance, a Portuguese force of 23 ships (mostly converted civilian vessels) carried a ground force of 1,500 Portuguese soldiers to assault the heavily fortified city, defended by 40,000 troops of the Bijapur Sultanate. The Portuguese took it with only 50 deaths; the Bijapur had lost over 6,000 men.
<ul><li> In the same year, another Portuguese force of 19 ships and 1,400 troops basically destroyed the Sultanate of Malacca (in modern Malaysia) by routing a Malaccan army of 30,000. This only costed them 28 men killed in battle.
</li><li> A couple years before either of these incidents, there was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Diu_%281509%29">the Battle of Diu<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1509. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">combined fleet</a> of the Indian Gujarat Sultanate and the Kingdom of Calicut, supported by Egypt and Venice, gathered in an attempt to halt Portuguese expansion into the Indian Ocean. The Indians had 46 ships, ~120 warboats, and ~5,000 marines, and cornered a Portuguese force of 18 ships and 800 marines... only to get utterly annihilated. The Portuguese lost 32 marines dead and no ships; the Indians lost 1,700 marines dead and nearly all of their ships and crews. Each Portuguese ship had far more firepower than its Indian equivalent owing to its superior guns, they could engage well beyond the Indians' effective range, and even in boarding actions that you'd figure would be favorable to the Indians, the Portuguese dished out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb-stomp</a> as the Gujaratis had absolutely no answer to the plate armor, arquebuses, and hand grenades of the Portuguese marines.
</li><li> Italy, despite being considered the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> of the Great Powers and having to push its resources to the limit to defeat minor European states like Greece, was able to conquer <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Ethiopian_War">Ethiopia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in about six months with a relatively small force of 100,000 men (mostly askaris). The best Ethiopian formations had WW1-era artillery, machine guns, and rifles; the vast majority of them didn't even have that.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3ktpb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3ktpb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3ktpb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">To wit, they had 234 antiquated field guns and 1,150 WW1-era machine guns for the <em>whole army</em>, plus a few WW1-era tanks. On paper they had an army of 500,000, but by Italian estimates, 75% of those men were armed with spears, bows, or black powder weapons. So, effectively, they really only had 125,000; their stock of "modern-ish" rifles combined with the aforementioned machine guns and artillery were <em>barely</em> enough to equip these ~125,000 to WW1 standards.</span> The Italians had then-modern tanks, airplanes, artillery, and poison gas. The Italians lost under 10,000 dead compared to over 275,000 for the Ethiopians, and the country only lasted as long as it did thanks to the ramshackle state of Italian logistics preventing faster advances.
</li></ul></li><li> The Opium War of 1839-1842 is another great example. 12,000 British soldiers and sepoys, supported and ferried by a force of 25 warships (mostly light sloops) and 12 other ships, themselves crewed by some 7,000 sailors and marines, took on local Qing Chinese forces numbering around 200,000. Despite none of these troops being considered great by European standards, and the force itself being tiny by those standards,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4l645');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4l645" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4l645');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Battle of Leipzig alone, a little under 26 years prior, involved <em>600,000</em> troops. Even the British invasion of the United States during the War of 1812, considered a sideshow at the time, had the Americans repulse a force of 48,000 troops and 105 ships.</span> they won handily. While Chinese disunity and superior British planning played a big part in the crushing victory they obtained, an equally important factor was their technological advantage. To give the long and short of it:
<ul><li> First and foremost, only 30-40% of the Chinese troops had guns- the rest being equipped with spears, swords, halberds, and bows. This would have been fine in the <em>16th century</em>, but was untenable in the 19th given how accurate and deadly firearms had become.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note543lm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note543lm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note543lm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mao, Haijian. <em>The Qing Empire and the Opium War: the collapse of the Heavenly Dynasty.</em> Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2016. Part of the Cambridge China Library. Page 29.</span>
</li><li> Second, the Chinese troops that <strong>did</strong> have guns had drastically inferior ones. The most common Chinese firearm was the bing-ding matchlock musket, which fired a 4 gram ball with a maximum effective range of 100 meters (330 feet), at a rate of 1-2 rounds a minute. The standard British firearm was the Brunswick rifle, a muzzle-loading percussion cap weapon that fired a 53 gram ball with a maximum effective range of 300 meters, at a rate of 4 rounds a minute. In other words, not only were the British weapons much deadlier (over a dozen times the mass per shot), but British troops could engage the Chinese far outside of their effective range (100m v 300m) and put out two to four times as many shots to boot.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6xooe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6xooe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6xooe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ibid, p. 28.</span>
</li><li> Third, the disparity was even worse when it came to artillery. Not only did British cannons fire larger shot than Chinese cannons <em>and</em> have thrice the range, but they were also lighter and easier to maneuver. Any artillery duel therefore turned into a one-sided massacre.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7yvyk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7yvyk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7yvyk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ibid, p. 30.</span>
</li><li> Fourth, to an even greater degree than their land forces, China's navy was terribly outmatched. Most of their ships were junks with only a few of the aforementioned inferior cannons each, which posed no threat to the Royal Navy. A British <em>frigate</em> was effectively a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One Ship Navy</a> by Chinese standards... and the British brought dozens of them.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8a0xe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8a0xe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8a0xe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At Chuenpi, for instance, the British frigate <em>HMS Volage</em> took on 16 Chinese warships. The <em>Volage</em> was undamaged bar some holes in its sails; the Chinese lost four junks and sustained serious damage to several others before sauntering off. They were so nonthreatening that the British captain, Henry Smith, allowed Admiral Guan Tianpei's flagship to escape despite easily having the ability to destroy it after it stayed back to fire on them, simply because he thought it was <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPointlessWasteOfHumanLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAPointlessWasteOfHumanLife">unnecessary</a> to further engage. Did we mention that the admiral's war junk had 12 cannons, each inferior to the average British piece, while the <em>Volage</em> had 50?</span> Predictably Brits had total naval superiority nearly from day one, giving them free reign to bombard Chinese cities and forts (from beyond their effective range, of course) and transport and disembark their troops anywhere they wanted using both the coast and the river network.
</li><li> Combine all of the above and you get: the British holding the initiative in every engagement allowing them to destroy the Chinese piecemeal, and being able to shred most Chinese formations in pitched battles before they could even get close enough to engage. Now remember one other thing: Qing China was probably the most <em>advanced</em> of the non-European powers. With that in mind it's no wonder that most of the world was subjugated by the Great Powers of Europe for hundreds of years.
</li></ul></li><li> This is basically the point of weight classes in combat sports like boxing, wrestling, and MMA. For example, since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusclesAreMeaningful">Muscles Are Meaningful</a>, even a less skilled 6'0, 200 pound boxer could destroy the best 5'7, 140 pound boxers. So sanctioning bodies declare that fighters can only have matches against opponents with sizes relatively close to their own, ensuring everyone <em>within</em> those classes has to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrongAndSkilled">Strong and Skilled</a>.
<ul><li> Professional boxing is a strange exception in that the major sanctioning bodies have no rule specifically against fighting above your weight class. Unlike amateur boxing (where a minimum weight is required to fight in a particular weight class) professional boxing only regulates the upper limit of each weight class. For instance, Roy Jones Jr. challenged for the heavyweight title while weighing less than most cruiserweights.
<ul><li> In addition, the heavyweight division has sometimes had fights with massive weight differences. Jack Dempsey fought against Jess Willard with a 25 kg weight disadvantage. Joe Louis fought against Primo Carnera with a 30 kg weight disadvantage. David Haye and an old Evander Holyfield both fought against Nikolai Valuev with a 45 kg weight disadvantage.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This is the experience of many high school students, especially smaller schools in rural areas, and realizing this is a substantial part of the college experience. A fairly bright student finds themselves valedictorian of their small high school, just to go to college and find themselves struggling to make Bs in competitive majors like engineering. Similarly, almost every communications major was previously the editor-in-chief of their high school newspaper. Almost every college football player used to be the star of their high school football team.
