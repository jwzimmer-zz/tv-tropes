The man's son tries to break in one of the horses, but it rears up and breaks his leg. While he is waiting for it to heal, war breaks out, and every able-bodied young man is drafted, sparing him. Every time the man's fortune seems to go up or down and people congratulate/feel sorry for him, he only answers "We'll see."
</li><li> A Jewish tale tells of how Rabbi Akiva traveled with a candle, a rooster, and a donkey: the candle so he could study the Torah at night, the rooster - his alarm clock - to wake him up to study the Torah, and finally the donkey to carry his possessions. Rabbi Akiva stopped at a city. He tried to get lodging at an inn but there was no room available. Rabbi Akiva went from house to house but nobody would let him in. So what did he do? He walked into the neighboring woods and set up camp. All of a sudden, a strong wind kicked up and extinguished the candle. A few moments later, a ferocious lion emerged from behind his tent and killed his donkey. What was left? The rooster. A ravenous cat appeared and devoured it. Rabbi Akiva was completely stuck. What did he say? "whatever God does, must be for the good." The next morning, Rabbi Akiva discovered that a band of robbers had attacked the town during the night, mercilessly killing the people and stealing their money. The robbers escaped into the forest. If they had seen the candle, or heard the noise of the rooster and donkey, Rabbi Akiva would have met the same fate as the townspeople. God had saved his life by extinguishing his candle and taking his animals.

<ul><li> The 9/11 attacks had many instances of this. Some are documented, while others are apocryphal:
<ul><li> On September 11, 2001, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SethMacFarlane">Seth MacFarlane</a> was scheduled to take a flight to Los Angeles from Boston. Due to a hangover and his agent giving him the wrong time for the flight, he missed the plane. He tried to find another flight, only to find that the terrorist attacks that day grounded all flights. He also learned that one of the hijacked planes, American Airlines Flight 11, was the one he was supposed to be on.
</li><li> There were people who worked in the buildings, but weren't there, either because they were sick, at somebody else's funeral, and one case even tells about someone who wasn't at his work on time because his shoelaces weren't tied.
</li><li> The History Channel documentary <em>102 Minutes that Changed America</em> shows an instance of this. A man who worked in one of the Towers can be seen on the phone with a friend, telling them that he overslept that morning because he was watching <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MondayNightFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MondayNightFootball">Monday Night Football</a></em> the night before and stayed up too late. He ends the conversation with, "<em>Monday Night Football</em> saved my life."
</li><li> As detailed in <em>The Falling Man</em>, Michael Lomonaco (the executive chef at Windows on the World) normally arrived early for work in the morning, but was running late because he had to drop his son off at school and get his glasses fixed at an optometrist in the lobby. He was ready to step on the elevator when the first plane struck, and was evacuated shortly afterwards. He became the only member of the staff to survive the day's events.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllMyChildren">All My Children</a></em> actress Eva LaRue (Dr. Maria Santos-Grey, 1993-1997, 2002-2005) and her husband John Callahan (Edmund Grey, 1992-2005) were scheduled to be passengers on American Airlines Flight 11, the first one to strike the World Trade Center. However, she felt ill due to her pregnancy and they decided to postpone to a later flight, thus saving theirs and their unborn child's life. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note39fdp');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note39fdp" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note39fdp');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Her character had been "killed" in a plane crash only four years earlier, making the storyline a horrific example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarsherInHindsight">Harsher in Hindsight</a>. </span>
</li><li> Hall of Fame basketball coach John Thompson was scheduled to do a studio interview in Los Angeles for Jim Rome's TV show. He wanted to fly out on the 11th so that he could make a friend's birthday party in Las Vegas on the 13th, and booked a ticket on American Airlines Flight 77 from Washington to L.A. A few days before the show, Rome's producer called, telling him that Thompson's original plans wouldn't work for the show, and asked him to rebook for the 12th. Thompson resisted, but the producer insisted, adding that Thompson would still be able to make it to Vegas in time for the party. Thompson finally agreed... and back at home in Arlington, Virginia, <em>felt the impact of Flight 77's crash into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePentagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePentagon">The Pentagon</a></em>.

This and the subsequent argument caused them to miss the flight.
</li><li> Sometimes thought of as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegends">urban legend</a>, but <a class="urllink" href="http://www.snopes.com/luck/choir.asp">marked as true<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Snopes">Snopes</a>. In 1950, the Reverend at the West Side Baptist Church in Beatrice, Nebraska lit a fire in the furnace and went home to eat with his family before choir practice at 7:20. Before he could go, his wife soiled her dress and they had to wait while she ironed another. Additionally, every other member of the choir had something delaying them as well. (Car trouble, a persistent math problem, oversleeping, etc.) As a result, every member of the choir was late for practice... good thing since the furnace ignited a gas leak and the empty church exploded five minutes after practice was supposed to begin.
</li><li> On November 28, 1942, the Boston College football team faced off against its cross-town archrival, Holy Cross. Boston College was undefeated and headed to a New Year's Day bowl game, and the Golden Eagles were heavy favorites against lightly regarded Holy Cross. Holy Cross proceeded to shock the college football world by demolishing Boston College 55-12, ruining the Golden Eagles' perfect season. The stunning defeat led to the cancellation of a victory party scheduled for that night at Boston's Cocoanut Grove nightclub. That night the Cocoanut Grove burned to the ground, killing 492 people. Who knows how many more would've died had the Eagles won.
</li><li> Tommy Allsup, guitarist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BuddyHolly">Buddy Holly</a>'s backing band, lost a coin toss to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens">Ritchie Valens</a>, who then took his spot on an airplane which later crashed, killing Holly, Valens, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBigBopper">The Big Bopper</a>.

<ul><li> Speaking of The Big Bopper, he wasn't intended to be on that flight either. When Holly chartered the plane, both Allsup and Holly's bass guitarist helped him pay for it, since they also wanted to arrive early for the next show so they could get some rest and do laundry. However, Bopper was suffering from the flu and had trouble fitting into a bus seat, so he persuaded the bassist to give him his spot on the plane.

Following the concert, Jimmie, Stevie Ray, and Jimmie's wife Connie were initially offered seats aboard a helicopter leaving the venue, but they arrived at the helicopter takeoff point to find that there was only one seat available, rather than the three they had been told to expect. Stevie Ray was eager to get back to the hotel and Jimmie didn't want to travel separately from his wife, so the brothers agreed that Stevie Ray would take the one remaining seat, while Jimmie and Connie stayed back to wait for a later flight. The helicopter in question <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Stevie_Ray_Vaughan">crashed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> due to pilot error less than a mile from the takeoff point, and everyone aboard was killed on impact, including Stevie Ray.
</li><li> On the night of May 7, 1902, a man named Louis-Auguste Cyparis got into a fight in the town of St. Pierre on the island of Martinique. He was booked for either assault or murder (accounts differ) and placed in solitary confinement in an underground cell. The next morning the island's volcano, Mount Pelee, erupted, wiping out the town of St. Pierre and killing thirty thousand people. Cyparis was one of only three documented survivors.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4nd6w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4nd6w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4nd6w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There are some reports of other survivors, but they were in the outer suburbs, not the city proper</span> The sheltered underground prison cell saved Cyparis's life. He later spent years traveling with the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, telling his story from inside a replica of his cell.
</li><li> Ivan Basso crashed on stage 5 of the 2015 edition of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance">Tour de France</a>. The days after the crash, he still had testicular pains, so he asked the race doctor to take a thorough look at what could be wrong. The diagnosis: Early stage testicular cancer. So early that he made a full recovery after the surgery is done.
</li><li> Similar to the above, Philadelphia Phillies first baseman John Kruk was holding someone on base (during 1994 spring training) when pitcher Mitch Williams threw the ball at him to keep the runner on, which bounced and hit Kruk in the groin, also breaking his protective cup. In the course of the subsequent medical examination, early stage testicular cancer is discovered, and Kruk also made a full recovery after surgery.
</li><li> Something similar also happened to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. On November 7, 2018, Ginsburg fell and broke three ribs. When doctors x-rayed her to examine the rib injures, they found very early-stage cancerous growths on her lung <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5g7eh');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5g7eh" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5g7eh');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">specifically, of a type of cancer that is easily treatable in the early stages, but usually doesn't present with symptoms until after the point where it can be easily treated</span>. The affected lobe was removed, and doctors later confirmed that no traces of cancer remained following the surgery. On February 19, 2019, exactly two months after her surgery, Ginsburg once again took her place on the bench. However, she would later be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, a much less treatable form of the disease, which claimed her life in September 2020.
</li><li> Yuri Yudin, a student at the Ural Polytechnical Institute, joined a group of nine fellow students to conduct a long-distance ski/hiking expedition. A day after leaving the last permanent settlement on the route, his chronic health problems forced him to turn back. All nine others in the group perished under mysterious circumstances in the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyatlov_Pass_incident">Dyatlov Pass incident.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> While he was just an average businessman, John D. Rockefeller booked himself on a routine train ride from Cleveland to Buffalo. However, he arrived at the station too late to catch his train. While passing over a bridge near Angola, New York, the last two cars of the train derailed. All but two of the passengers in the car he would have been in were burned alive.
</li><li> Enrique Wilson of the New York Yankees was planning to fly home to the Dominican Republic on November 12, 2001, a week after the Yankees were to play the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Diamondbacks won and Wilson decided to go home early since there would be no celebratory parade. The plane he would have been on ended up crashing in Queens. There were no survivors.
</li><li> Stalin and Hitler signed a nonaggression pact for their joint occupation of Poland. Several Jews escaped from the Nazi occupied parts of Poland to the Russian occupied parts only to be deported to gulags and Siberia. When Hitler double crossed Stalin and attacked the Soviet Union, Stalin granted amnesty to his Polish prisoners and let them form their own army.
</li><li> In April 1865, William Seward, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AbrahamLincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>'s Secretary of State, had been injured in a carriage accident a week before Lincoln's assassination and was confined to bed wearing a jaw splint. On the night of the assassination, one of Booth's conspirators snuck into his house and stabbed Seward in the neck, but his jaw cast blocked the assassin's knife. His son Frederick too also had a lucky accident that night. When trying to fight off the assassin, the attacker Powell pulled out a gun but it jammed. Rather than clear the jam, Powell pistol-whipped Frederick and knocked him out. Painful, but it broke the gun in the process and kept him from following up with a kill shot.
</li><li> After the Paris attacks in 2015, at least a few <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EaglesOfDeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EaglesOfDeathMetal">Eagles of Death Metal</a> fans ended up on the news because they were meant to go to the Bataclan theatre but ended up missing the concert because they were sick or had family commitments. At said concert, roughly 89 people were shot dead by gunmen working for Daesh or Islamic State.
</li><li> There have been quite a few stories from April 1912 of passengers who were scheduled to travel on the maiden voyage of the ill-fated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RMSTitanic">RMS Titanic</a></em> but never making it due to either cancelling for unknown reasons, or for losing their tickets prior to sailing, such as J.P. Morgan and Hersheys chocolate founder Milton S. Hershey. One man who was hired as a stoker was reported to have had his workbook stolen, thus saving his life, most likely at the cost of the thief's.
</li><li> One girl at the 2017 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/ArianaGrande">Ariana Grande</a> concert attacked by ISIS in Manchester only survived because she misread a text from her mother telling her where to meet up. The mother died.
</li><li> On April 15, 2002, a South Korean tour group was shifted to the rear of the plane back to Busan because the tour guide left his bag at the hotel and the bus carrying the group had to go back for it, and this delay meant that the good seats were taken by the time they checked in. However, this blunder ended up saving most of their lives; that plane <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_China_Flight_129">ended up flying into a mountain because the pilots mishandled the approach to Gimhae Airport<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, leaving only 37 survivors, most of them in much the same crappy seats the guide caused his group to be shifted into.
</li><li> The <em>Guidepost</em> magazine column "<em>His Mysterious Ways</em>" often features stories like this. For example, a woman had her shoes stolen while at a conference. She was forced to give her speech in a pair of flats. When a crazed gunman stormed into the conference room and opened fire, a bullet struck the wall two inches above her head—where her head would have been had she been wearing the high heels that were pilfered.
</li><li> Five men serving on <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin%27s_lost_expedition">Franklin's lost expedition<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> were forced to disembark at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greenland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Greenland">Greenland</a> due to being judged unfit for service. This meant that they avoided the horrible fates everyone else on the expedition suffered.
</li><li> In 1960 Marilyn Meeker &amp; Larry Pierce were fifth in the world in ice dance, and were looking almost certain to win their first U.S. National title and return to the World Championships, but that December Meeker broke her ankle and was unable to compete for the rest of the 1960-1961 season. Pierce teamed up with another partner, and they won the National title and a spot on the World team. Then the plane the entire World team was on crashed, killing everyone. Meeker would struggle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorsGuilt">Survivor's Guilt</a> for a long time afterwards.
</li><li> Robert Bishop was unable to serve his usual role as steward on the SS <em>Edmund Fitzgerald</em> in 1975, due to being bedridden with bleeding ulcers. The voyage he had to miss turned out to be the ship's last, as she was lost with all hands in a storm the day after she left port.

R. R. Tolkien</a> came down with a bad case of trench fever and had to be removed from combat. While he was away from active combat, the battalion he was part of got almost completely wiped out during the later stages of the Battle of the Somme.
</li><li> Fritz Kolbe - a German diplomat who gave information about the Nazis to the Allies - was stopped on his way to the office by a warden. He got off his bicycle, showed his pass; then, a bomb fell less than 50 meters from the two men, knocking them violently to the ground. They were stunned and covered with debris, but were not hurt. Had Kolbe not been stopped, he would have been at the point of the bomb's impact, where there was a smoking crater.
</li><li> Allan West was supposed to be part of the infamous <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_1962_Alcatraz_escape_attempt">1962 Alcatraz escape<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Unfortunately, he was unable to get out of his cell, resulting in the other three leaving without him. Given that it's very possible that the trio drowned in the bay, this may ultimately have been for the best. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note61brk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note61brk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note61brk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Alcatraz tourist merchandise has one prisoner who later served several years as a tour guide mention a rumor that West might have deliberately not put much effort into escaping his cell due to a last minute attack of the nerves. </span>
</li><li> Israel Hands, first mate of the famed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Blackbeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a>, was shot by his boss for seemingly no reason. He survived the shooting, and was forced to stay behind on a particular voyage. Said voyage would be Blackbeard's last.
