But there's a wide period where someone can become a parent, which can result in <em>decades</em> of difference in age. One sibling may be in diapers when the other is already at university or even has children of their own. They're practically in different generations despite being from the same generation. This could lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">Big Brother Instinct</a>, and for a slightly shorter age gap, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a>.
</p><p>More often this is because they're half-siblings, with the younger sibling being the result of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">MayDecember Romance</a> on their shared father's part. Or they're full-blooded siblings, but one was born early into their parents' relationship (likely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">Teen Pregnancy</a>) and the latter in their late 30s/40s, maybe even 50s with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyElderlyMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyElderlyMother">Absurdly Elderly Mother</a>. Or long after having their first kid, the parents chose to adopt.

If they're close, the older sibling may be more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a> or uncle/aunt in their behavior, rather than a regular sibling interaction. This can also lead to an uncle/aunt around the same age or even younger than their nephew/niece, who if close might share a sibling or cousin-like bond. Maybe they'll make jokes about the situation.
</p><p>Sometimes there is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist">Plot Twist</a> where it turns out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyRelationshipSwitcheroo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyRelationshipSwitcheroo">the older sibling was really the parent</a> and had the younger sibling at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">a young age</a>.
</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayflyDecemberRomance">If one of the parents is immortal</a>, this is almost guaranteed, though the age difference might be so huge the older sibling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PosthumousSibling">died long before the younger was even born</a>. Producing these is semi-expected for kings and general nobility, as it ensures there's no lack of an heir. It was also common before reliable birth control as people often married young and were expected to have a lot of kids (partly because of high child mortality rates). Likely to contribute to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">Tangled Family Tree</a> or get older siblings asked <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatCuteKidYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IsThatCuteKidYours">Is That Cute Kid Yours?</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another">Another</a></em>: Kouichi's mother, Ritsuko, died not long after giving birth to him at 27, while her younger sister Reiko was a 15-year-old middle school student. Reiko's age is significant because she was a casualty of the curse that strikes parents and siblings of Class 3-3 members, which was Reiko's class at the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>: Zeke Yeager is ten years older than his half-brother, Eren.

At the time of his death, he was 27 and Orihime was 12.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BunnyDrop">Bunny Drop</a></em>: The central characters of the series are Daikichi and his aunt, Rin. However, Rin is 24 years younger than Daikichi, because she was born through an affair Daikichi's grandfather had with a mangaka. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It is later revealed that Rin is not Souichi's biological daughter, however.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: With an official 108 consorts for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmperor">Charles zi Britannia</a>, there are plenty of half-siblings and even full-blooded siblings with years if not decades sized age gaps. For example, Second Princess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkActionGirl">Cornelia</a> is 27, while her younger sister Third Princess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrincessClassic">Euphemia</a> is 16. Schneizel, the Second Prince of Britannia, is almost in his thirties, while his half-brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Lelouch</a> is 17. Extra materials reveal that Clovis (24) has a younger full-blooded sister who is fourteen years old. The only ones with a reasonable age gap are Lelouch and Nunnally, born three years apart, something that is likely because their mother Marianne was the favored consort to Charles.

This means that while Yuki was a kid, Ayame was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">Aloof Big Brother</a> who wanted nothing to do with him, leaving Yuki <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenPedestal">permanently disillusioned towards him</a>. Ayame came to regret this deeply, and by the time the manga starts, has become the exact opposite, an extremely clingy and flamboyantly affectionate brother by whom Yuki is often annoyed.

Kashima was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToParent">Promoted to Parent</a> after his parents' deaths and was still Koutarou's primary caretaker while their parents travelled/worked a lot, and Kamitani acts as Taka's closest older male familial figure in place of their father (who divorced and left the family after the birth of Taka, who's unaware he even has a father). Since the two are used to looking after their siblings, they become part-time sitters for their school's daycare (where several staff leave their preschool-age kids while they work). The age gap (and lack of parents) is what makes Kashima so dedicated to his younger brother; Kamitani meanwhile is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">Aloof Big Brother</a> who constantly find his younger brother's tantrums or misbehaviour annoying. Kashima lampshades not being able to fight like normal siblings due to the age difference, but the two teens nevertheless love their younger brothers and are protective of them due to their circumstances.

Mer age similarly to the races of Men <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityBeginsAtTwenty">until early adulthood</a>, at which point their aging slows considerably.

A prominent example is Barenziah, Queen and later Queen Mother of Morrowind and Wayrest. As a teenager, she had an affair with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">Emperor</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Tiber Septim</a>, which resulted in a pregnancy. Since a child with a Dunmeri mistress would be incredibly inconvenient to Septim and his nascent empire, he ordered his healer to magically abort the child.

Around 20 years later, she would also birth an illegitimate child with a mysterious figure known as the "Nightingale", later revealed to be Drayven Indoril; the child was Dralsi Indoril, mother of Karliah from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>.

The brother, whose real name is not given, left home at the age of 12 to earn money to support the family; the hero at that time was only three.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GeorgeWashington">George Washington</a>'s father was a widower who remarried his much younger mother. In total, there were ten children between the two marriages. His half-brothers were much older than him and he was the oldest of his six full siblings. The oldest half-sibling who survived to adulthood was his brother Lawrence (who was his father figure for most of his formative years), fifteen years his senior and twenty-two years older than the youngest child, Charles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnTyler">John Tyler</a> had more children than any other President, due to being widowed during his presidency and then remarrying 21-year-old Julia Gardner. As a result, his youngest child was almost forty years younger than his oldest. Said child would also remarry and have kids as an old man, resulting in an over 130-year difference between them and the President. As of 2019, he's by leaps and bounds the earliest President to have living grandchildren.
