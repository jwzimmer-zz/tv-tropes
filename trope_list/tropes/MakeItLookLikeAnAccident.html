Maybe it's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Intrepid Reporter</a>, or one of those <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMeddlingKids">Meddling Kids</a>. It would be convenient if this inconvenient individual could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">removed from the picture... permanently</a>. But a murder rap would really make things even more inconvenient, especially if you're a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity">Villain with Good Publicity</a> who really cannot afford bad publicity. So your primary option as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is to hire someone to take care of this little problem. But it can't look like murder, and it can't just be a mysterious death.
</p><p>So what's the alternative? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Make It Look Like an Accident</a>. The villain or other inconvenienced party tells an assassin or other person that the inconvenient person has to die in a way that looks like an unfortunate happenstance, so suspicion will not fall on themselves or anyone else.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Note that the simple <em>invocation</em> of this trope is usually considered justification enough that the villains are playing by "real world rules", even if what they actually do can't be construed as being an accident by any stretch of the imagination.
</p><p>This trope is probably thought of by many soon-to-be murderers, and so, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Remember, just because it was ruled as an accident doesn't necessarily mean it truly was. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">Heh... heh... heh...</a>
</p><p>One reason a character may do this is to quickly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InheritanceMurder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InheritanceMurder">gain their inheritance</a>. In America (and many other countries), a person convicted of a crime is forbidden by law to keep any money they make as a result of the crime, so anyone killing for inheritance or a life insurance payout would probably try to make it seem like an accidental death.
</p><p>Often used as a method of attempting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">Murder the Hypotenuse</a>, and as an excuse not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYaJustShootHim">just shoot the bastard</a>. If made to look like a death by animal attack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisBearWasFramed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisBearWasFramed">This Bear Was Framed</a>. A more elaborate military murder, with the same intent, is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a>. Similar to the inverted form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderByMistake">Murder by Mistake</a>, in which a murder is dressed up to look as if the killer got the wrong victim. When the villains want to make it look like someone else did the killing, it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp">Frame-Up</a>.

She is assured that the contract has a high payout for rape, but a good deal less for an accidental death, so she might want to lower the former so if she is sexually abused, at least the crew won't find it expedient to murder her afterwards to avoid paying up.
</li><li> The protagonist of Barry Eisler's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnRain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnRain">John Rain</a></em> series specializes in making assassinations look like accidental and (especially) natural deaths.

He gets a lethal overdose of the sedative they've been using as a DIY truth serum, and they stage a car crash. (Those British Intelligence connections keep an autopsy from being performed.)

That the car (which was traveling at 25 mph at the time of what was proven to be an intentional crash) would have had to have been traveling at more than 100 mph for it to even be likely to have the bowling ball to become airborne. Needless to say, the husband  it was proven he killed her because she had filed for divorce after years of abuse and he was going to lose everything in the settlement  was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

While the majority of missions allow you to kill almost anyone at any time with any implementation, killing indirectly means less evidence to clean up for your handlers and therefore nets you a larger score.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney">Hitman: Blood Money</a></em>, the best way to make Silent Assassin rank is to make the killings of your targets look like accidents, which you can do by many means in the game (falling chandeliers, explosively igniting grills, and other creatively nasty ways). This is also the only means of killing non-targets without affecting rank or getting a cash penalty. Of course, some methods of arranging accidents would probably start people wondering in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. For example, the best way to off a pair of actors during a rehearsal is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoFakePropWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoFakePropWeapon">to swap out the prop gun for a real one</a>. Then, when one of the targets shoots the other and comes to check, drop a lighting fixture on them. It would be hard to explain that with a series of a freak accidents.

Riding along in the jumpseat, he used hammers to attack the flight crew, hitting each in the head, injuries which would be virtually indistinguishable from those incurred in a crash. Despite severe injuries, Captain David Sanders and Flight Engineer Andrew Peterson retaliated, and a struggle began with the two attempting to pin their attacker while co-pilot James Tucker stayed at the controls. Tucker being a former Navy pilot, he began turning the plane in a wild, unpredictable manner intended to keep Calloway off balance, nearly rolling it on its back and taking it near uncontrollable speed. Eventually Calloway was pinned, and the captain, also former Navy, took control and began an immediate landing. Due to trauma and blood loss, all three were losing strength, and they needed to get on the ground or risk Calloway breaking loose again, so there was no time to dump fuel. They had to land overweight, at a dangerously steep angle, at a recklessly fast speed, but the captain pulled it off. Calloway was arrested and sentenced to life in prison, but the flight crew were forced to retire from flying due to complications from the injuries they sustained.

He gave them to his son Timothy, daughter Elizabeth, and some friends who were trick-or-treating with them. The idea was to kill his two children and the others, making it look like the Urban Legend of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorApples" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorApples">Halloween poisonings</a>; then, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinancialAbuse">he'd collect on the large life insurance policies he had on both of his children</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring">Poor Timothy was killed</a>, but Elizabeth and the other kids didn't eat the poisoned candy, so they were safe; soon the story and plot fell apart and O'Bryan became the focus of the investigation, was detained/jailed, and ultimately got executed by lethal injection in 1984. In the greater Houston area he's sometimes called "the man who killed Halloween" or "The Candy Man". <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2n1jn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2n1jn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2n1jn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">"The Candy Man" can also refer to the Houston serial killer <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Corll">Dean Corll<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, whose family owned a candy factory.</span>
</li><li> Omnipresent in the brutal dictatorship of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo Molina in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DominicanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DominicanRepublic">Dominican Republic</a>. The most famous case, perhaps, is that of the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.learntoquestion.com/seevak/groups/2000/sites/mirabal/English/assassination_fs.html">Mirabal Sisters<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, who were brutally murdered by Trujillos own right-hand men, and then placed in a car that was then pushed off a cliff to make it look like they lost control of the car and drove over the cliff. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">This particular crime may have played a vital part in the fall of his dictatorship</a>, as the crimes <strong>massively</strong> pissed the Dominicans off due to how loved the Mirabal sisters were by the populace AND the USA government wasn't exactly happy either... and in less than a year, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack">Trujillo was murdered</a>. A novel and later movie was written about it, called <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InTheTimeOfTheButterflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InTheTimeOfTheButterflies">In the Time of the Butterflies</a></em>.
</li><li> With modern <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> cars <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">it would be a rather poor tactic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOldestTricksInTheBook">to sever a brake line or pour oil on the brake discs</a>. First, brake failure would become apparent to the driver while still at very slow speed in the parking lot, second, modern ABS braking systems have <em>totally</em> separated circuits in the ABS unit, unlike an older, mechanical, dual-circuit braking system (where the fluid may still leak from all the system even if only one circuit has been tampered with), so the modern car can brake just fine, albeit slower.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">Deaths in police custody</a> have been commonly attributed to the suspect "falling down the stairs".
</li><li> Practically any "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HuntingAccident">Hunting "Accident"</a>" with the nobility or royalty for any country anytime in history. One particularly famous case is the death of King William II of England, son of William the Conqueror, who was shot in the New Forest. Whether or not it was truly accidental will likely never be known.
</li><li> Union activist <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Silkwood">Karen Silkwood<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> died in a car accident as she was on her way to meet a reporter from <em>The New York Times</em> where she intended to expose the unsafe conditions at the nuclear fuel plant where she worked. It assumed by many that she was intentionally run off the road. Evidence does indicate this, but with no witnesses, the official cause of death is "accident". The theory that Silkwood's death was due to foul play was the inspiration for a similar scene in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChinaSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChinaSyndrome">The China Syndrome</a></em>.
</li><li> In 1943, American codebreakers decrypted a detailed itinerary for a inspection/morale tour of front areas by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. The problem was that the US was heavily relying on Japanese confidence in their "unbreakable" code, which had been in use since before Pearl Harbor  but had been broken very early on. To conceal the fact that their information came from breaking the code and preserve that source of intelligence, the mission was set up to make it appear that a flight of P-38's just happened to "accidentally" stumble on Yamamoto's flight, and the success of the mission was hidden even by the US. It wasn't until after the Japanese acknowledged his death a month later that Americans learned this themselves, and that it was a deliberate strike was hidden until well after the war. Astonishingly, it did pass as an accident, even though the P-38s were right at the limit of their operational range when they encountered Yamamoto's aircraft, meaning they had to have taken off at exactly the right time for interception.
</li><li> There have been rumors that Jessica Savitch, the first host of <em>Frontline</em>, was bumped off in this manner months after the broadcast of "NFL and Game Fixing: An Unauthorized History of the NFL". Long story short, a documentary that connects a powerful organization to organized crime can make you a whole lot of powerful enemies.
</li><li> In October 2007, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Peterson">Drew Peterson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>'s 4th wife Stacy mysteriously vanished. Despite rampant  and likely correct  suspicion that he murdered her, there was no evidence to support this. However, this made cops become suspicious regarding the death of his <em>3rd</em> wife Kathleen, who was found dead in her bathtub 3 years prior. Despite his history of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a> and their acrimonious divorce, it was deemed that she'd drowned after slipping and hitting her head. A second autopsy found that she had in fact been struck on the head and then forcibly held underwater.
</li><li> Pretty much <em>every</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> or fictional cop show will feature criminals who try to invoke varying versions of this. Accident, suicide, self-defense, "someone else did it", etc.
</li><li> In some places where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse">honor killings</a> are common, the family members of the victim will say that she died in a "kitchen fire".
</li><li> In 2019, Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire accused of trafficking children for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">sexual purposes</a>, "committed suicide" while awaiting trial. Epstein was linked to numerous rich and powerful figures, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfWindsor">Prince Andrew of England</a>, and more. This led to suspicions that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSuicide">murdered</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">in order to prevent his testimony from implicating them</a>. Aside from the obvious motive, he was under suicide watch at the time, in a maximum security jail that hadnt seen a successful suicide in thirty years, due to a previous "suicide" attempt. Which it later emerged Epstein claimed was actually him being attacked and nearly killed by a fellow prisoner, who was receiving orders from a cellphone he somehow had with him inside the prison. Furthermore, Epstein was in high spirits when he was last seen alive, believing that he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">certainly going to be let off for his crimes</a>. Even more suspiciously, despite the official story that Epstein hanged himself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">the coroners report</a> showed that his neck injuries were more typical of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckSnap">homicidal strangulation</a> than suicidal hanging. Unsurprisingly, the internet has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">done what it does best</a>, and bait-and-switch posts that end in "Epstein didn't kill himself" <a class="urllink" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/617/538/ce6.jpg">have<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/618/962/0ae.jpg">become<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="https://melmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-12.04.30-PM.png">a<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/031/624/eps.jpg">meme<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> In the army, this is known as "Fragging." The idea is that squaddies become fed up with being ordered to their deaths and shoot one of their superiors in the back (or face) or throw a live grenade at him, then blame it on the enemy. One soldier even wrote a nasty letter to the munitions plant who manufactured his grenades because they failed to blow up his seargeant.
