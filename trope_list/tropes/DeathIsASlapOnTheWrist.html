<div class="indent">— <strong>Morte</strong> after the player has died repeatedly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PlanescapeTorment">Planescape: Torment</a></em>
</div></div><p>In most video games, when you die, there is a penalty. However, this trope is about how in some games death is nothing more than a minor obstacle, a slap on the wrist, and not something to ever worry about, even for the worst of players.
</p><p>Death may be there just for formality's sake. For example, the makers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prey2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prey2006">Prey</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em> both said they didn't want to interrupt the narrative by forcing players to redo sections of the game they are poor at, so they gave you unlimited lives with no requirement to retry what you failed at. Some cooperative games, online or otherwise, use unlimited lives to keep the party going. For example, the offline mode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em> has a "come back to life where you last saved" system like most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter">First Person Shooters</a>. However, if you're playing online cooperative mode, you come back to life on the spot when you die, and can do this infinite times, essentially transforming the game from a challenge into a party.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>There's been a noticeable progression of this trope in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MMORPG">MMORPG</a> genre, starting with the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiUserDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiUserDungeon">Multi User Dungeons</a>. Early MUDs and MMOs tended to carry a steep death penalty in terms of lost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterLevel">Character Levels</a>, or even most or all of your character's gear. Later games have gradually reduced or eliminated the penalties in order to appeal to more casual gamers, although some still offer a "hardcore" mode that preserves some or all of them, up to and including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a>.
</p><p>Dying without penalty is very common in games today <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">in order to ease frustration</a> of players that may repeatedly die and is also present in games where dying is very common due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">the game being brutally difficult</a>. Dying in a game nowadays tends to be quick and the player can return in a just as quick manner without the flow of the game being bogged down by restarting from the last <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Checkpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Checkpoint">checkpoint</a> or the start of the level.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>A notable consequence of small or nonexistent death penalties is that there may be occasions where dying becomes <em>beneficial</em>. If you're playing a game where the only penalty for death is going back to your last checkpoint and your next objective requires you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backtracking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backtracking">go back there</a>, the quickest way to get there is often in a body bag. Intentional death is often used by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeedRun">speedrunners</a> to gain an advantage in these situations. Some games may also restore your health when you die, leading dying players to succumb on purpose so that they can get a fresh start.
</p><p>This tends to happen if the player is playing an arcade game and is emulating it and the game doesn't send them back upon death, as the player can just insert one of their imaginary coins with the push of a button and easily get as many credits as the game will allow. Lives system and no penalty also became more common in platformers on flash and other indie games since the early 2000s where it spread to mainstream games.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>A sister trope to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessLives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaninglessLives">Meaningless Lives</a>, where the player theoretically has a limited number of lives, but there's enough that running out is nearly impossible, or/and you don't lose much at all if you do. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful">Continuing is Painful</a>, where you lose a <em>lot</em> more than expected should you decide to keep going after you lose. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPointStarvation">Check-Point Starvation</a>, where lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CheckPoint">check points</a> results in going back really far after dying. Contrast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">Final Death</a>, where dead characters stay dead (although in the case of party members, they may be easily replaced). Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsNotPermanent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsNotPermanent">Death Is Not Permanent</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Death Is Cheap</a>, which are non-gameplay equivalents to the same trope. When this applies in the afterlife, as in the myth of Valhalla, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Warrior Heaven</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsWar">Hell Is War</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliceMadnessReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AliceMadnessReturns">Alice: Madness Returns</a></em>, if you fall off a platform, you simply reform on another platform. (Dying in a fight sends you to the last checkpoint, though.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Badland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Badland">Badland</a></em> had checkpoints placed after every two obstacles or so and loading to a checkpoint took a second or less, and was done in subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FadeToBlack">Fade to Black</a> fashion. However, this checkpoint placement made the game harder if you wanted to also save your characters clones alongside it. If you missed one, passed an obstacle, and died, you would be respawned past it with the clone out of reach.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BinaryBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BinaryBoy">Binary Boy</a></em> had checkpoints after every obstacle and dying resulted in your character being blown off the screen and to the last checkpoint in a beautiful falling-leaf effect. Thus, its almost shocking when its subverted during the giant squid attack: dying sent you to the very beginning, when the battle (he never attacks you directly, only lethal due to the water displacement) had several different and relatively difficult stages.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBreach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBreach">The Breach</a></em>, the number of lives is unlimited. Each death sends Sergei back to the beginning of the level, but he retains all the gained experience, all his upgrades, and any key he found. The enemies are all back, but it isn't specific to the player's death: the monsters systematically reappear when leaving an area.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CyGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CyGirls">Cy Girls</a></em> contained huge maps that give you a checkpoint practically every time you go through a door. If you should die or fail the mission, you can choose to continue. Doing so will place you at the last checkpoint (which will most likely set you back all of two seconds) with no other difference other than you're now at full health. Using health items is pointless if you can just die to get it all back. To be fair, this certainly is a big help when conserving for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">certain bosses</a> in the game.
</li><li> In <em>Exile</em> (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BBCMicro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BBCMicro">BBC Micro</a> game), dying simply returns you to your last teleport position and applies a score penalty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Geist">Geist</a></em>, if the host Raimi is currently possessing has the life meter depleted, and is an expendable host, Raimi's soul simply leaves the body so he can look for another one. But if the deceased host is key for the mission, or no more hosts remain, <em>or</em> Raimi spends too much time as a ghost while looking for another host (even a single plant or an object), then it's a definitive Game Over.
</li><li> Dying in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IttleDew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IttleDew">Ittle Dew</a></em> merely restarts the current (generally small) room. The only time this really matters is during boss fights or possibly a speedrun. Because of this, most of the game's challenge ends up coming from the puzzles.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Killer7">Killer7</a></em>, dying as Dan, Kaede, Kevin, Coyote, Con or Mask simply transports you back to the last Harman's Room you visited. You can then switch to Garcian and make your way back to the place where the persona got killed, retrieve it, get transported back to Harman's Room and resurrect it by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">repeatedly pressing X</a>. You even get to keep all the blood you've collected. <em>However</em>, this means playing through the same stretch of level <em>at least three times</em>: 1) the original run before dying, 2) as Garcian up to the spot where you died, 3) a third run with the restored persona. Considering that the enemies respawn constantly, and Garcian is the weaker member of Killer7, dying isn't the walk in the park it's supposed to be. And if Garcian himself dies, it's a definitive Game Over.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKainSoulReaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKainSoulReaver">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a></em>, Raziel is immortal, and the plot dictates he physically can't die since he serves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Elder God</a>. If his health runs out, he just shifts to the spectral plane, where he can simply suck a few stray souls to restore his health, then find a portal and go back to the material realm. The sequel averts this, as Raziel fights <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">demons</a> that will follow you the spectral plane to kill you.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> series:
<ul><li> If you die in a dungeon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, rather than being booted back to the entrance like in previous games, you restart in the room where you died. Unless you quit and reload.
</li><li> If you die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwords">The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords</a></em>, you come back to life on the spot from a preset number of rupees. The only problem is that rupees are so common in the game that this mechanic is barely a punishment in single player (On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DSi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DSi">DSi</a> version anyways) and makes it extremely unlikely you'll ever actually get a game over outside the Hero's Trial.
</li><li> In nearly every <em>Zelda</em> game, acts that you would expect to kill you instantly such as falling into endless pits or pools of lava will just cause you to lose a small amount of health and return to the beginning of the room.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>, falling into deep water without Zora's flippers returns you to shore instantly with no penalty, and on top of that you get temporary invincibility!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> doesn't have any actual game over screens. Dying just respawns you at the beginning of the area you came through or the beginning of the dungeon. Most likely a necessity since you're on a strict time limit to save the world from a falling moon.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegoAdaptationGame">Lego Adaptation Games</a> give you infinite lives, and you respawn on the spot with no progress lost, except in the first game's vehicle levels, which return you to checkpoints. The only penalty is that you drop some Lego studs (the game's currency), and you can just pick them back up when you respawn, unless you fall into a bottomless pit. There's also an in-universe example in the <em>Goblet of Fire</em> portion of <em>Harry Potter:</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cedric falls apart when killed with Avada Kedavra. When Harry gets back to Hogwarts with Cedric's body, Dumbledore hands Cedric's father instructions to put him back together.</span>
<ul><li> It gets lampshaded directly in <em>Lego Batman 3</em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Kevin Smith:</strong> Seriously since when did videogames have to be so punishing? I mean, the best ones just let you die over and over with very little consequence other than losing studs, or you know...whatever.
</div></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Solatorobo">Solatorobo</a></em> takes this approach to death. Even if you fall off a floating mini-island in a level like Sealyham you'll simply reappear back at the point where you died, same health level and all.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sundered">Sundered</a></em>, dying just sends you back to the Sanctuary, where your health elixirs and ammunition will be replenished and where you can immediately spend all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Shards</a> you collected on your last run. The layout of the map <em>will</em> change slightly every time you die and you will need to backtrack, but otherwise all the progress youve made is kept.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanSouls">Titan Souls</a></em>, after death, the player character instantly respawns at the last checkpoint. There are no penalties whatsoever (apart from an increasing death counter).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokusIslandExpress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YokusIslandExpress">Yoku's Island Express</a></em>, "dying" (as in losing your ball in a pinball-table zone) only results in the loss of a few pieces of fruit, the in-game currency that's more than plentiful. Justified in that this prevents the pinball sections from becoming incredibly frustrating. In fact, you <em>need</em> to "die" a certain number of times to unlock a particular sidequest.

This makes death against standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">mooks</a> trivial but losing to a boss or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossInMookClothing">a Handyman</a> several times in a row can make defeating them nearly or <em>literally</em> impossible without loading a previous save because you have no way to do enough damage to them.

If you're playing with other people, the enemies that you died fighting don't even regain any health (unless you're facing a raid boss, as the game disallows players from re-entering the fight until it's either over, or all players have died). At least until you gain enough levels for the game to start seriously chunking your money, as payments for regeneration are based on a percentage.
<ul><li> Just getting dropped to 0HP isn't instant death — you have a short time where you lay prone, unable to aim down the sights and with the screen getting darker, but if you can score a kill while in this state you receive a "second wind" and get back up with about 40% HP.

As long as at least one team member is well out of the way of any scuffles and isn't moving fast on a vehicle, any other team-mate can respawn nearby with default equips after a matter of seconds. In some cases, this is beneficial, and can be abused at times by repeatedly team-killing to max out some equipment and grenades. However, if you've activated the Iron Skull the entire team restarts at the last checkpoint if anyone dies.

Considering the game's main thrust is really cooperation with score as a secondary concern, that's hardly a penalty.
</li><li> After about the fourth level, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prey2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Prey2006">Prey (2006)</a></em> allows you to appear in the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld">Spirit World</a>" when you die.

You can die as many times as you like, and other than the "spirit world" detour, you lose no progress. Even bosses keep the damage done to them.
<ul><li> A small amount of life and magic is restored even if the player does not shoot down any spirits. The effective playable area of the spirit world shrinks around the central hole-in-the-ground portal to the living world, effectively sucking you in. These two aspects conspire in <em>forcing you back to life no matter how desperately you attempt to stay dead.</em>

</li><li> Death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TorchlightII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TorchlightII">Torchlight II</a></em> gives the option to respawn in the current act's town for free, at the entrance you arrived from for the current area, or, if the area allows it, immediately where you died for a percentage of your gold with the latter two. None of these options cost you experience, fame, or drop equipment. If you already have a waypoint portal open, which are indefinite until you open a new one, then the first option only costs you a short amount of time to walk back to the scene of your death. This is, of course, averted in hardcore, and the GUTS SDK means you can readily make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> that either removes these penalties altogether or make it so that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuingIsPainful">Continuing is Painful</a> instead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictorVran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictorVran">Victor Vran</a></em>, dying will just teleport you to the latest checkpoint while emptying the overdrive meter. It doesn't cost XP, gold, items, and doesn't break the uncompleted challenges of the map (unless they're incompatible with the acts of dying or suffering damages, of course). Dead enemies don't respawn and injuried enemies aren't healed. This is downplayed during big scripted bossfights, as the boss and his followers are healed and resurrected (just the boss' own clique, not all the mooks of the level) if Victor is killed before being able to slay the boss.

<ul><li> You lose nothing from dying except one of your hero stars, which each give you a 15% damage and healing bonus. In instanced dungeons, the enemies you've already defeated don't even respawn, only those who had survived your attacks receive full health again. If you're in a team, they might not even do that unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">the whole team is defeated near-simultaneously</a>. This has led to a 'strategy' for defeating some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">particularly difficult bosses</a> that the developers have referred to as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">'zerging'</a>, where everyone just bolts back to the boss fight room as quickly as they can after death. They claim to be working on ways to prevent this.
</li><li> Since Spring 2010, most of the new bosses have had special doors used to lock out re-entries when players are killed in mid-battle, which only open after the boss is dead or has been reset by a team wipe.
</li><li> You also have the option of spending some of your character's money to repurchase your stars. Seeing as you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">spend your money on nearly nothing but this and costume changes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">death literally is cheap</a>.

<ul><li> There's no penalty for dying until level 10, save that you return to the nearest hospital if you don't have another way to revive yourself. After level 10, your character receives experience debt for dying; half the experience you earn goes toward "paying off" the debt. In fact, this can have benefits: you level slower, allowing you to gain more influence (the game's currency).
</li><li> Prior to the implementation of the time travel system, some completionist players would intentionally incur debt in order to slow leveling and help prevent outleveling story arcs.
</li><li> After Issue 13, debt simply eats a chunk out of the player's Patrol XP (read: rested XP), turning what was a slap into a light tap. Debt means so little that the developers included the option to turn XP gain off to help the aforementioned completionists.
</li><li> Death and paying off debt had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AchievementSystem">their own set of badges</a>, which led to a long-standing motto among <em>City</em> players: "Debt is just another badge."

However, you can also switch to "Retro Mode" to bring back the lives system from the previous games.
</li><li> Warned in a <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonMastersOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigimonMastersOnline">Digimon Masters Online</a></em> loading screen tip, if your partner digimon dies (If your tamer's level is higher than 5 and/or your digimon's level is higher than 11), you will be sent to the closest town with a 2%~5% EXP penalty, and you both will be nearly at 15%~20% health and digisoul. Kind of stubborn when you're high levelled.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonsAndDragonsOnline">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online</a>: Eberron Unlimited</em>, dying means a small loss of durability for your equipped items, the loss of any magic buffs, a 1-minute debuff, and the bother of running to a resurrection shrine, which are plentiful enough on most quests. Around level 10, divine casters also start picking up their first resurrection-type spells, too. Singular deaths (not party wipes) are only a big deal if you're dying in rapid succession (the debuff stacks, and your equipment will become unusable), or in certain raids that will send you to a "penalty box"..
</li><li> Death in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EveOnline">EVE Online</a></em> is a slap on the wrist to your character.
<ul><li> Being a capsuleer, you have access to death-defying cloning technology, and getting shot down is a mere inconvenience. This quickly becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>, however, if you fail to keep your clone up to date with your skills. If you don't, you can lose literally years of game play by dying.
</li><li> If your capsule is destroyed, your body is killed, and you awaken in a new body. This means that you lose any implants and hardwirings you may have had inserted into your brain. And considering the value of some of those implants, that can easily amount to several hundred million ISK!
</li></ul></li><li> Dying in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> is mostly painless. If you are defeated, you can either wait for a player to revive you or return to your home point/the dungeon entrance (you can't return during an 8 man trial or raid however). Being revived does come with a penalty to your stats and said penalty stacks upon being revived a second time or more if the weakness hasn't worn off yet, but for the most part, you can get back up and resume the fight to help your team.
</li><li> The death penalty in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars">Guild Wars</a></em> is so slight it makes some rather frustrating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamePlayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GamePlayAndStorySegregation">Game Play And Story Segregation</a> when a major NPC is killed in the Prophecies campaign. Characters take -15% penalty to their HP and Energy for each death, to a maximum of 60%. This penalty decreases as the character earns XP and is completely erased the moment he sets foot in a town or outpost (which are typically every 1-3 zones). The only annoying thing is that a dead character has to be resurrected manually by a living party member using a resurrection spell—but even that is ignored if the entire party dies, at which point they'll be resurrected and teleported to the nearest "resurrection shrine" they passed (typically at the entrance to the zone or just outside a major checkpoint). There is no gold cost or damage to the progress in the current instance in any case. But in Hard Mode, if every party member reaches the 60% penalty during a wipe, the party is considered defeated and forced to return to their starting outpost. For certain activities like vanquishing, this can mean losing entire <em>hours</em> of work.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>, you don't even immediately get "really" dead when your health drops to zero. First, you enter a "downed state", which has a separate health bar that decreases on its own, and you can still try to slowly heal yourself over time or attack in the hope of killing an enemy, which revives you if you manage to do it before your downed health bar is depleted to. If you do manage to fully die ("defeated state" in game terminology), you can still immediately revive at any waypoint for a small monetary cost. And in the personal story, death is even more of a slap on the wrist: you just get thrown back to the instance entrance and can run back and continue fighting. The enemies don't even heal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HoboWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HoboWars">HoboWars</a></em> - a player can use the hospital to fully heal themselves. Losing to other players does decrease the win rate, but the win rate has no benefits other than allowing the player to enter Bernard's Mansion at no cost.
</li><li> No one ever dies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>, they only get 'Beaten Up', which is four rounds of -50% reduction to stats, effectively only three rounds because the round of getting Beaten Up is counted. There are easily obtainable cures and skills that remove even this effect, and an update to the game in early 2013 allowed you to remove Beaten Up by simply resting at your campsite.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em>, another Turbine game, allows certain classes to resurrect dead party members. Otherwise, you can opt to return to the resurrection point (usually a circle of stones, or at the start of an instance) nearest (for some value of "nearest") to where you died. Once every couple of hours you can resurrect on the spot for free, or you can pay some "mithril coins" (purchased with real-life money) to do so more often, though this is possibly less than useful, since whatever killed you may still be hanging around. (It also doesn't apply in instances or if you died due to "misadventure", like falling off a cliff, since falling off a cliff could put your body in a spot you can't normally get to or more importantly get out of).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MafiaWars">Mafia Wars</a></em> diligently follows this trope, especially when healing using the New York City currency.
</li><li> Respawn costs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar">Nexus Clash</a></em> scale with character level, so for new players, death is this trope and coming back from the dead costs only one regular action. Low-level characters respawn randomly in the mortal world, so you may actually get to where you were trying to go faster by dying and reincarnating.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PhantasyStarOnline">Phantasy Star Online</a></em> is a bit like this. When killed, your character appears in the medical room, completely healed for free (not that it was expensive to start with). It's simply a matter of finding your way back to where you were, which is tedious but by no means difficult, or shouting at another member to lay down a pipe as a shortcut. It does, however, reduce your limit break bar to zero, which can be irritating.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanOnline">Pirates of the Caribbean Online</a></em>, being knocked out and sent to jail in combat results in the player gaining the "Groggy" status, which reduces your maximum health and voodoo to about 80% for about 10 minutes, and... that's it. No gold penalty, no loss of weapons. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted</a>, however, if your ship sinks in the middle of the ocean - in that case, in addition to being Groggy, you'll lose all your loot from that run and you'll have to pay a fee to restore your ship.

The game's explanation is that you're actually just injured, and the "Rooks" (the army) rescued you. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsUpToYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsUpToYou">This is as much as they help you in the levels.</a> At least they installed those checkpoints.

It didn't take</a>. However, death is <em>still</em> a slap on the wrist, doing damage to your Soul Vitality; run out, and you're severely weakened.
</li><li> Players who do "3-iteming" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> usually don't have a lot to worry about.
</li><li> Most of the time, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em> has no penalty for death at all, you just have to wait a few seconds to respawn. While playing specific "Elite" multiplayer missions, you will get injuries when you die, which you must heal using items or by visiting an NPC. You can also activate an optional higher difficulty setting that does the same in story missions. Even then it's still largely in the slap on the wrist territory. The injuries will only noticeably affect gameplay if you have many stacked on at once, the healing items are not expensive and the NPC will heal them for free.
</li><li> In <em>Richard Garriott's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TabulaRasa">Tabula Rasa</a></em>, the death that Receptives (that is, player characters) experience on the battlefield is more like clinical death (the heart stops beating) rather than biological death (the brain ceases functioning), which helps <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justification">explain why</a> it's a slap on the wrist. Receptives can either get an emergency teleport off the battlefield to their last spawn point or get revived by squadmates. <em>Tabula Rasa</em> specifically refers to this as Resuscitation (keeping in line with death being merely clinical death), but players don't get away <em>entirely</em> scot-free as they have to deal with Resuscitation Trauma: 10% equipment damage and all attributes reduced by 20% for 5 minutes. This condition gets worse with subsequent deaths, reducing stats by 60% for 15 minutes. One of the joke announcements at Foreas Base made reference to this:
<div class="indent">"Attention all personnel: No matter how many times you die, it is always disconcerting. Open counseling is now available with Dr. Williams for those who are suffering from Post Death Nervous Disorder. That is all."
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreeOfSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TreeOfSavior">Tree of Savior</a></em> doesn't punish players too hard for death—they're given the option of waiting for a resurrection or respawning at their last spawn point (or, revive right where they died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Microtransactions">for one iCoin</a> as of the closed betas). However, dying does dramatically drop the durability of equipped gear, and certain items carried in a player's inventory (such as gemstones) will be destroyed or dropped upon death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UrbanDead">Urban Dead</a></em> is one big humans vs zombies fight, and nobody dies forever. Humans who die can stand right back up again as zombies and start attacking other humans. Zombies who hit 0HP are only temporarily dead, and can stand right back up and continue their reign of terror. And zombies who are sick of being undead and smelly can get themselves cured of their condition and restored to humanity by human scientists who inject them with a special drug cocktail. If you die in Monroeville, though, you're a zombie forever, and until recently a headshot would permanently kill a zombie there.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101">Wizard 101</a></em>, death takes you back to the hub of the particular world you're in, with only one hp. However, your health restores steadily in the hub, or you can go back out to the dangerous areas and grab some red wisps, which restore a quarter of your health. You don't lose gold, experience, or anything else when you die, either. The only real downside is the time it takes to get back to wherever you were when you died.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> Should you die, you take a 10% equipment durability penalty and have to reclaim your corpse with your spirit, starting from that zone's graveyard. (If you die from a player killing you, only the latter.) Under optimal conditions, neither penalty sets a player back more than a few minutes (unless players from the opposing faction start camping your corpse). But sometimes the graveyard is far, far away from your corpse (e.g. in the Badlands) and/or the durability penalty makes a huge hit on your virtual wallet. Nevertheless, unlike other MMORPGs, you <em>never</em> lose experience points or levels and you <em>never</em> lose any equipment.
</li><li> It is possible, albeit rare, to die in such a way that you are unable to reach your corpse, in which case you are forced to resurrect <em>at</em> the graveyard for an additional 25% durability penalty to all gear in your inventory as well as 75% reduced damage and stats for 10 minutes, which hurts a bit more. It's still trivial compared to older MMOs, however.
</li><li> Death is such a minor penalty that in some situations it is a viable strategy to die in the middle of enemies, run back from the graveyard as a ghost, reclaim your corpse as close to your goal as possible and then get killed again, repeatedly until you're where you want to be. This is called a "corpse run". If you do this naked, your gear takes no damage. It's rarely worth the effort, but there are a few places, such as the capital cities of the opposing faction or a cave required for a level 60 quest chain, where shortcuts aren't possible and a corpse run is quicker than fighting your way through. Some classes also have abilities (as well as some items) that can actually be used for suicide. Killing yourself doesn't cause durability damage to your gear so in raids, some players might kill themselves rather than die in a clearly losing fight. There are also resurrection spells, which effectively leave the durability damage as the only penalty. However, this still requires a friendly not-dead character of a class with the appropriate spell nearby, and most resurrection spells cannot be cast when the caster is in combat (druids being a rare exception, and even their combat resurrection spell has limits). Unless, that is, youre a Shaman, who <em>can</em> resurrect themselves.
</li><li> Though rarely useful, death can be used offensively. When encountering a <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wowpedia.org/Shadow_Labyrinth">particularly dense<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> group of enemies, the main party stands back. A priest takes off all his clothes (to negate the durability loss) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">Mind Controls</a> one enemy. The other enemies kill it, then kill the priest, then walk back to their spawn points. A party member resurrects the priest, who repeats the process until there are few enough enemies left that they can be attacked directly.
</li><li> There is another death penalty, although it's not tied to death specifically: when everyone in combat with a certain NPC leaves combat, whether due to death or any other reason like using class abilities to hide or teleporting back home, that NPC generally returns to its original place and regains all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> and loses and buffs and debuffs on it. This is the really relevant death penalty in raiding or other high-end content. If your group manages to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> boss down to a quarter of his health but then your entire group dies, when you come back, he will have healed fully and you'll have to try again and hopefully do it right this time.

You regain both fairly quickly, so the main downside is that you need to navigate your way from the Null Chamber to wherever you were. This is not a problem at all if you were doing something in a location which is easy to return to (to the point that players fighting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">hordes of enemies</a> in standard areas have been known to say "brb going to null" <em>every couple of minutes</em>), but it's absolutely <em>devastating</em> if you were most of the way through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonLevel">Marathon Level</a>. This is why such things are usually tackled by groups of players who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatResuscitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatResuscitation">have the ability to revive one another on the spot</a> so that nobody gets booted from the instance - getting hurt isn't a problem in and of itself, but being sent back to the Null Chamber can be, depending on what you were doing.

The XBLA incarnation of <em>B-K</em> follows suit turning death into a slap on the wrist at best.

These types of worlds can easily get a dedicated player hundreds, if not thousands of deaths in a single play session.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Frogger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Frogger">Frogger: The Great Quest</a></em>, there are infinite lives, and when you die, you are just sent back to your last checkpoint with all of your current progress unchanged apart from your location. This means you retain all of your items, and any damage you did to enemies and bosses will still be kept. This is one of the complaints of the game, as the fact that you retain all of your items and any damage you did to bosses means that there's no real penalty for dying at all apart from having to work your way back to your prior location. This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> though, as the Fairy Frogmother gifted Froger with her magic so he couldn't truly die while on his quest.
</li><li> Dying (or even continuing) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX5">Mega Man X5</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6">X6</a></em> just takes you back to the last checkpoint you reached in the level. Thankfully, at least in the case of the latter, because of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">pretty unforgiving</a> difficulty.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMessenger2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheMessenger2018">The Messenger (2018)</a></em>, whenever The Ninja dies, a tiny demon name Quarble appears and sends The Ninja back to the latest checkpoint while collecting any time shards as payment for his service. Later, when The Ninja becomes a shopkeeper for the next messenger, it turns out that the deaths had to be manually prevented by the shopkeepers, but due to the negligence of the previous shopkeeper to inform The Ninja about this, the new messenger ended up dying for good.
</li><li> <em>Munin</em> has no lives or death penalty. All levels are a single screen, so dying just means you lose any feathers you've picked up.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nidhogg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nidhogg">Nidhogg</a></em>. If a fencer dies, they will respawn in front of the other fencer in a few seconds unless they reach a check point. The more deaths in a row, the longer the respawn time will take.
</li><li> Die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia2008">Prince of Persia (2008)</a></em> and Elika will will use her magic to return you to the last place you were on solid ground or the start of the current battle as appropriate. She saves you even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">when she's completely helpless due to a boss' spell</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts">Psychonauts</a></em>, you have health. <em>And</em> lives (well, "astral projections"). When you run out of health, you respawn with one life lost. When you run out of lives and you're in someone's mind, you just get kicked out of their mind, and you can go right back in without having to backtrack. For some odd reason, the whole astral projections thing carries over the the <em>real world</em>. If you get mauled painfully by a psychic bear, then you'll simply reappear. And if you lose all your lives in the real world, you'll just reappear again. Even more so in the case of drowning as, when grabbed and dragged under, you reappear nearby with no loss of health, lives, not even a loading screen. Except for in the final level - going back to the checkpoint is seriously painful because of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> the level is.
</li><li> This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">the entire point</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RunmanRaceAroundTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RunmanRaceAroundTheWorld">Runman Race Around The World</a></em>. Dying is no different than pressing the suicide button and even then, colliding with a boss is the only way to die. There isn't even any death counter (like in Matt Thorson's other games) to punish your stupidity.
</li><li> If you die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scaler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Scaler">Scaler</a></em>, then you'll just reappear, usually not that far away from where you died. There is absolutely no penalty <em>at all</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShovelKnight">Shovel Knight</a></em>, you have infinite lives, and death causes you to lose a chunk of money and respawns you at the latest checkpoint. You can recover your lost money by getting it back once you reach the spot where you died, but this trope really comes into play to a greater extent much later in the game once you've powered yourself up and have more money than you need, at which point losing it means nothing. Furthermore, money lost at a boss fight can be recovered easily in most cases simply by revisiting the boss fight.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsonsGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSimpsonsGame">The Simpsons Game</a></em> plays this one straight. If you fall into a pit, you'll be returned back to the edge. If you run out of health, you'll automatically switch to the other character. The dead character will soon revive with full health, but you can also revive them instantly with a push of a button if you're right next to them. If both of your characters are dead, you will be taken to the latest chackpoint.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em>, dying simply brings you back to the last checkpoint. To compensate for this, your final <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation">Rank Inflation</a> will be affected by your retries, and taking damage will make you lose all your rings without being able to reclaim them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioOdyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a></em> is the first main series <em>Mario</em> game to get rid of lives entirely. Instead, dying sends you back to the nearest checkpoint, at the cost of 10 coins. Coins are very easy to come by, making running out unlikely. (People who've tried find that you STILL respawn at the last checkpoint.)
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a></em>-offshoot <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPrincessPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPrincessPeach">Super Princess Peach</a></em> has no lives. The only real penalty for dying is that levels have no checkpoints, so if you die, you have to start the level over again. You also keep whatever items you found before you died.
</li><li> It's a saving grace in otherwise hard game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VVVVVV">VVVVVV</a></em> where checkpoints are almost everywhere.

Anything that would hurt Wario merely knocks him back or transforms him, with the third game not even having you lose any money in the process. There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonStandardGameOver">Non Standard Game Over</a> which results in death in <em>Wario Land 3</em> (getting caught by the final boss), but even that merely knocks Wario back to the map screen with no progress lost.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWorld">Wario World</a></em>, if you die, you can continue <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawnOnTheSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RespawnOnTheSpot">right where you left off</a> as long as you have enough coins. Not having enough coins to continue is unlikely, since coins are everywhere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardsAndWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WizardsAndWarriors">Wizards and Warriors</a></em> allows you to die and come back to life right at the spot where you left off. It's enough to make one wonder if the Boots of Lava Walk are worth getting. Who cares if they protect you from getting hurt by lava, if you can respawn on the spot indefinitely? Exception to the rule, however, is on boss fights. If you die on a boss fight, the boss's life gets refilled, thus causing lost progress at that point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Gamer2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Gamer2">Gamer 2</a></em>, the maps are littered with checkpoints, and dying simply respawns you at the furthest one you've reached. Any enemies you killed or objectives you completed don't even reset. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Except in the final boss fight, where the boss has destroyed your checkpoint, forcing a full level restart if you die.</span>
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em>, if you lose all your lives and choose to continue, any progress you've made on the current world won't be reset to any degree, unlike the NES and SNES versions. The only effect continuing has at all is resetting the score counter back to zero.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BackToBed">Back To Bed</a></em>, Bob dying just instantly sends him back to the beginning of the level with no interruptions to the flow of gameplay. Thus, it's often beneficial to let him stumble around a couple of times so that you can take the whole level in, before using that knowledge to finish it properly.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BookwormAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BookwormAdventures">Bookworm Adventures</a></em>, dying in combat only sends Lex back to the beginning of the chapter he died in with no experience or potions lost (other than the ones he used up during the fight). In fact, if Lex dies in a late chapter of a book, he can replay Moxie's minigames to get more potions and gem tiles. The only reason to be concerned about dying is that it lowers your final score.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImmortalSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ImmortalSouls">Immortal Souls</a></em>, if John dies in a battle, you just simply have to fight the battle over.

In fact, if you are attempting to get everything, dying is sometimes <em>required</em>.

<ul><li> In the RTS/RPG hybrid, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Sacrifice">Sacrifice</a></em>, this applies twice over, and even extends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a>. Wizards who ally themselves with one of the five gods can erect mystical altars to those gods. Through these altars, their souls are sustained directly by divine power. Thusly, when a wizard is slain, they merely become an ethereal ghost for a short time before they spontaneously resurrect again at full health. The only way to put a wizard down for good is to mystically defile their altar, and then kill them. Even then, the destruction of their altar merely means they can't resurrect <em>at that place</em>; they will instead be resurrected at the next nearest altar of their god. The culture of wizards in the setting has developed to take advantage of that fact. The only way a wizard can permanently die is if their soul is somehow banished in a place beyond the vision of their patron god, or if they are banished whilst their patron god's primary altar is destroyed, something that also kills the god in question.

Pro and Elite modes up the ante a bit by making you have to wait a few seconds to respawn, but nothing that is likely to ruin your day. Putting Ironmode on, however, causes you to have to restart the song from the very beginning and not posting your high score if you overfill any column. Forgetting that this mode is on and trying a difficult song can lead to some frustrating situations.

In fact, the only way to get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> is to deliberately <em>not</em> use the spring that will help you give the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> the well-deserved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoombaStomp">Goomba Stomp</a> that ends the game.

But as long as you retrieve their caps before they dissapear, you can revive them <em>for free</em> once the level is finished <em>without any penalty at all</em>. In the sequel, the only drawback of getting your hero unit killed is 20 seconds 'till respawn. However, certain boss battle attacks, like Dodonga's Om Nom Nom, are an one-hit kill which <em>not only</em> destroys the Patapon, it also destroys his cap, so your little guy will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeath">gone forever.</a> <em>Hatapon</em> is another exception: If he dies you fail the mission, similarly to what happens when all your army gets destroyed.

Instead, pass/fail status is used to determine whether you get the 50,000-point Clear Bonus, which can and will greatly impact your grade, especially if you're trying for the coveted S++ rank (990,000 points or more; you won't even have enough points for an S+ if you fail).

This only applies to Music Play (the standard mode); Challenge Mode will end your credit early if you hit 0% life at any point. Also, failing a song under any circumstances nullifies any Clear Rate percentage you would've otherwise gotten from it, which also prevents you from earning any Rank Points (since Rank Points are equal to chart level * Clear Rate * gauge-type bonus).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Maimai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Maimai">maimai</a></em> always grants you a full set of stages, even if you fail every single one of them.

Additionally, in Standard Start, the Excessive Rate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a>, which normally ends the stage instantly if it's allowed to reach 0%, will instead be swapped out for the easier Effective Rate meter, ensuring that you'll not only get all of your stages, you'll play every track in its entirety too. As such, there's pretty much no reason not to use Excessive Rate in Standard Start.
</li><li> Draining your life in <em>Neon FM</em> will simply disable gameplay for a few measures and, if the setting for it is enabled, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MercyMode">you'll be dropped down to an easier chart</a>. However, if you play on Pro Mode, the song terminates if your life hits 0.

Girls Band Party!</a></em>, if you're in single-player and your lifebar empties out, you fail the song instantly, unsurprisingly. However, in multiplayer, you'll keep going to the end, albeit with a 90% penalty to all points earned onward. Heck, in many cases, it's entirely possible for one player to carry four failed-out teammates to a clear, though obviously the rewards won't be as great compared to everyone staying alive.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AzureDreams">Azure Dreams</a></em>, if you "die" in the Tower, you simply reawaken back at home too, which you would do anyway even if you hadn't die and returned normally. However, if in case of "death", you awake <em>sans</em> everything else you had with you <em>except</em> for home-hatched familiars.
</li><li> Dying in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Elona">Elona</a></em> will cause you to lose a small percentage of your money, and the potential (i.e. the speed at which it levels) for some skills may degrade after level 6. You may also drop some of your items, which will be there when you return.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Hades">Hades</a></em>, dying resets your progress through Hades and forces you to start a new run, but also lets you keep certain items you found on the way out that can grant you permanent bonuses for your next run. The trope is also integral to the story: The protagonist, Zagreus, is the son of Hades and prince of the underworld, and cannot die permanently, and all the bosses he faces are employees of his father who similarly cannot die. Dying to, or killing, a boss on your way out will have both sides remark on it the next time you meet them as though you did little but temporarily inconvenience them, and in many ways you <em>need</em> to die — repeatedly — to obtain the power needed to complete the game.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZettaiHeroProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZettaiHeroProject">Zettai Hero Project</a></em>, death boots you from the dungeon, but you also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackStrong">gain permanent statistic boosts</a> for every level you gained on the way to it, making frequent and repeated deaths an integral part of the gameplay.

<ul><li> A couple of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Atelier">Atelier</a></em> games are lenient with death penalties:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierEschaAndLogyAlchemistsOfTheDuskSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierEschaAndLogyAlchemistsOfTheDuskSky">Atelier Escha &amp; Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky</a></em>, losing a battle loses one day of time and nothing else. Which, given how many days the game gives you, is practically nothing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> is possible most of the time, but really not even worth bothering with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierSophieTheAlchemistOfTheMysteriousBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AtelierSophieTheAlchemistOfTheMysteriousBook">Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book</a></em>, party members who fall in battle come back with one hit point afterwards. If the whole party falls, they respawn back at base, minus some collected items.
</li></ul></li><li> Any character who dies in battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> will be revived with 1 HP once the battle is finished (unless all of your characters die, then it's game over).
</li><li> Dying on a mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrisisCore">Crisis Core</a></em> is actually a great way to heal your HP, MP, and AP to the max. The only "penalty" incurred is that your DMW emotion is set to normal, which may not even be a penalty depending on how much you want the DMW to interrupt the fight.
</li><li> The <em>Soulsborne</em> games (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> trilogy, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>) are known for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">brutally difficult games</a> where you will die a <em>lot</em>. Mercifully, dying is not too much of a punishment.
<ul><li> Though each game has its own special punishment for dying, the main punishment in all of them is that you drop all of your currently held souls/Blood Echoes (which function as both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">Experience Points</a> and currency) where you died. If you make it back to that spot without dying again, you get to pick them back up. If you do die again, then they're lost forever, but no big deal, you can always get more by beating up more enemies. If you don't have very many souls/Echoes on you to begin with, then dying on purpose can actually be a very convenient way to quickly get back to the Archstone/bonfire/lamp, or you can make a suicide run to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneNuke">grab a powerful item early</a> before being clobbered by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gate</a> that's 30+ levels above you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em>, dying in Body Form causes you to come back in Soul Form, which halves your max health. However, the game is balanced around being in Soul Form most of the time anyway, as the only way to regain Body Form is to beat a boss, help another player beat a boss, invade and kill another player, or use a Stone of Ephemeral Eyes which are rare and expensive. It's more accurate to say that Body Form doubles your max health rather than saying Soul Form halves it. There's also a ring you can find in the very first area of the game (outside of the tutorial and hub world) that increases your max health while in Soul Form to 75% of that of your Body Form, somewhat mitigating the penalty. Lastly, being in Soul Form means you can't be invaded by other players, which can be considered a huge benefit depending on whether you want to be invaded or not. However, it also means you can't summon other players for help either. Of course, neither of those matter anymore since the online servers for the game were shut down in 2018 (though private servers for emulated copies of the game exist).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsI">Dark Souls</a></em>, dying also causes you to drop your "soft" Humanity (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Fan Nickname</a> for the Humanity stat, with "hard" Humanity being the item) along with your souls, which is also retrieved when picking up your dropped souls. If you end up losing it forever, it's easy to regain as there are several locations in the game where easily farmable enemies drop hard Humanity. Dying also turns you into a Hollow if you were human when you died. The only disadvantages to being a Hollow are the inability to summon friendly players for help or kindle bonfires to increase the number of Estus Flask charges they give you, and also ruining all your hard work in the character creator by making you look like a zombie (if you haven't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealedCustomization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConcealedCustomization">already ruined it yourself by putting a helmet over it</a>). However, being Hollow means you can't be invaded either, so it's a fair tradeoff. To become a human again, you only need to spend one soft Humanity to Reverse Hollowing at a bonfire.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> brings back the <em>Demon's Souls</em> style punishment of halving your max health, but does so by lowering it gradually with each death as you gradually become more and more Hollow. Unlike <em>Demon's Souls</em>, however, the Human Effigies that turn you human again are far more plentiful and easier to obtain than Stones of Ephemeral Eyes were. Also, just like in <em>Demon's Souls</em>, there's a ring you can obtain very early in the game that caps the penalty at 75% of your max health rather than half. Also, you still can't summon help while Hollow, but unlike the previous game you <em>can</em> be invaded. However, you can burn a Human Effigy in a bonfire to block all invasions in the surrounding area for half an hour.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> goes back to only having two states like <em>Demon's Souls</em> and the first <em>Dark Souls</em>, this time "embered" and "unembered". Being embered enables summoning/invasions and gives you an extra 30% max health, but the unembered health is treated as the default. You can regain your embered state when unembered by beating a boss, helping someone else beat a boss, invading someone and killing them, or simply using an Ember which are fairly commonly dropped by some enemies. There is no Hollowing at all at the start of the game (due to your character being an Unkindled and not a true Undead), but you can enable it as part of a sidequest. However, it's purely cosmetic for the most part, and the one effect it does provide is entirely beneficial (using a "Hollow" weapon while Hollow increases your Luck stat, which Hollow weapons scale off of). Hollowing can be either temporarily treated, pemanently cured, or simply hidden by wearing a ring that makes you look human.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em> is the kindest game in the franchise, as its only unique punishment for dying is that sometimes your dropped Blood Echoes will be held by an enemy in the general vicinity of where you died instead of lying on the ground, forcing you to kill it to get them back, which is only really a problem if it happens to be the same enemy that killed you the last time. Of course, it makes up for this kindness by also being arguably the <em>hardest</em> game in the franchise.
</li></ul></li><li> Losing a fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuest">Dragon Quest</a></em> only results in being punted back to the last town you were in with half your gold. The worst that can happen in addition to this is you also lose some (non equipment) items and often not enough for you to notice. This penalty is lessened by the bank mechanic in the games. You can store gold with an NPC Banker (in units of 1,000), and it will not be touched even if your party dies. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em>, Stella the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpositionFairy">Exposition Fairy</a> will encourage you to use it if she thinks you're carrying around too much money.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em> does this in a similar way to <em>Dragon Quest IX</em>, with the addition of having your PP set to zero. In fact, in <em>EarthBound</em>, the money you receive from battles is automatically put into storage, so you're not even likely to be carrying any money to lose. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MOTHER3">Mother 3</a></em>, not only is money a literal non-issue in the first three chapters, but you don't even lose any PP.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalTwilight">Eternal Twilight</a></em>: Dying only costs a small percentage of gold, and that's if you want to immediately start at a certain location or the beginning of a boss battle without reloading a save.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em>, the consequences of death are losing what few experience orbs were lying on the ground at the time (they tend to decay pretty quickly even while you live) and... a permanent scar on your character. While the designers intended this to be a deterrent, in practice this can become a worthwhile objective as it adds a more badass touch to your character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII">Fable III</a></em>, you do lose all fractional experience toward your next Guild Seal when you die, but getting 50 of these at a time from story missions is fairly common, and you can't lose ones that are fully complete. Not only that, but you respawn immediately every time, meaning that you can't possibly lose any real progress in story missions even if you go make a sandwich while bosses beat on you.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Faria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Faria">Faria</a></em>, if you die, you get brought back to life where you last saved with half your gold. This isn't too painful, as getting killed can often be blamed on missing an item you should have already bought or losing your way in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMaze">maze</a>.
</li><li> Losing a battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIIRevenantWings">Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings</a></em> gives you the option to restart the fight or run off to the world map. It also gives you pity experience.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyMysticQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyMysticQuest">Final Fantasy Mystic Quest</a></em> enables players to restart battles if they lose. And if the fight started with the player being ambushed, it'll just be a normal fight next time.
</li><li> If you die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, you can retry from just before entering the battle, allowing you to retry the fight as much as you want, or just run away. Death is even beneficial, nearly mandatory, in some plot fights. The game just loves to throw you into a boss fight right after a cutscene where your party members change. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience">Leaked Experience</a> prevents it from being Unwinnable, but you haven't had an opportunity to spend that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeakedExperience">Leaked Experience</a> yet, and it starts your new party out with random paradigms (combinations of class roles) so it's entirely possible that you will lack the class roles necessary to beat the boss. If you retry one of these fights, it puts you directly into the options menu so you can take care of this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LightningReturnsFinalFantasyXIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></em>, if you die and run out of other options, you can always escape for the low, low cost of 0 EP. The only catch is that you lose an hour of the world's time, which really isn't generally too big a deal given you can basically just abuse Chronostasis and the game gives you more than enough time to get done what you need if you play it right. On the Final Day, there is no ticking clock, so this is played 100% straight. If you die, or even if you just don't like how things are going, you can run right out of any battle at no penalty whatsoever.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeCocoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeCocoon">Jade Cocoon</a></em>, if you "die" in the Forests, you simply reawaken back at home.
</li><li> An interesting juxtaposition happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuramasaTheDemonBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MuramasaTheDemonBlade">Muramasa: The Demon Blade</a></em> considering the optional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Harder Than Hard</a> difficulty and scaling enemy level: while it's extremely easy to die, doing so outside of a boss battle just causes you to respawn in the same screen you were killed with full health and swords at full strength, retain all experience points earned, regain any health items you used during the fight, <em>and</em> you might not even run into the same battle that killed you previously. On the other hand, you can't cook stat-boosting meals within battles, so the items remain consumed unless you reload a save. On Shigurui/Fury difficulty, you really want to make use of those stat-boosts, especially against some of the bosses, but you die—and die a lot—so it's a matter of deciding if it's worth cooking a meal and being prepared for the tedium of resetting the game if you run out of ingredients.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsI">Kingdom Hearts</a></em> lets you continue from the last room you were in anytime you die with everything you had when you died. The only time this ever really matters is on boss fights, as the enemies in the room you died in respawn with full health.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsChainOfMemories">Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</a></em>: Dying places Sora/Riku in the room before the one where the player died, with no real penalty applied.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts358DaysOver2">Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days</a></em>: Dying during the story mode places the player right before the fight that killed them with full health and Limit gauge, magic and items get restocked to the level they were prior to entering the room, and mission progress/Heart Points from the point of death are preserved.
</li><li> In <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfDrakkar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfDrakkar">Kingdom Of Drakkar</a></em>, all you need to do is run back to get whatever item(s) were in your hand and purchase a point of constitution. However, when you die to certain lair monsters (such as dragons, griffons, and the like), your character will lose experience, skill, and <em>permanent hit points</em>, which may not be able to be recovered <em>at all</em>. Even worse is that dying in some areas will cause monsters to remove your gear and destroy it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegendOfMana">Legend of Mana</a></em>: If you die, and you have a companion animal (or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotBuddy">Robot Buddy</a>) and/or NPC, you can come back to life if they can manage to stay alive while you respawn. And even if your entire party gets wiped out, you just restart in the screen you started in with maxed out super meters. (Of course, if you fall during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Tropicallo</a>...)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostDimension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostDimension">Lost Dimension</a></em>, if you fail a mission, you can either retry it with no penalty or return to the Lobby to reassess, get new equipment or try a different mission to level up, again with no penalty. Also, regardless of damage taken, skills expended or KOs during battle, all characters are returned to full status following a mission, win or lose.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LostOdyssey">Lost Odyssey</a></em> has immortal characters that function this way in battle. Even when knocked out, they'll self-revive after a few turns as long as at least one party member is standing at all time.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MageKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MageKnight">Mage Knight</a> Apocalypse</em> revives you at the nearest magestone crystal when your character dies, without penalty. Letting your allies die is a bit more serious, they respawn, but a glitch resets their AI, so they'll use physical attacks instead of skills.
</li><li> Unless it involves the storyline, if the player loses a battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManaKhemiaAlchemistsOfAlrevis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ManaKhemiaAlchemistsOfAlrevis">Mana Khemia Alchemists Of Alrevis</a></em>, instead of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> screen, the player characters will be automatically teleported to the school infirmary.
</li><li> If you get a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigiDreamTeam">Mario &amp; Luigi: Dream Team</a></em>, you can just restart the battle from turn one — no loss of coins, items, EXP, or progress (unless you choose to return to the title screen). You can even restart it in easy mode if you so choose. Hard mode? ...not so much.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegamanBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> series has an interesting relationship with this trope. If a character's NetNavi is deleted by a virus attack, they can be restored from a backup - they are just programs after all, even if most of them are highly customized and develop unique personalities after a while. This happens several times to the Navis os supporting characters (whose Navis are unique characters in their own right). Yet is the player's Navi Megaman is deleted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameOver">Game Over</a>, back to the title screen with you. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Justified because MegaMan.EXE is the protagonist's twin brother, who underwent experimental <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">Brain Uploading</a> before dying as an infant. The resulting incredibly complex program is constantly in flux and cannot be backed up.</span>
</li><li> Upon losing a fight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyWorldMyWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MyWorldMyWay">My World, My Way</a></em>, you can choose to have your XP gain for the (game) day cut in half, have your gold supply cut in half, or expend 20 Pout Points to nullify both penalties and revive on the spot (albeit with only one HP)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere">Odin Sphere</a></em>, dying only returns you to the start of the level in which you died. Which is fortunate, considering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">how often it happens</a>. This is more prevalent in the original than in the remake since the combat in <em>Leifthrasir</em> is more balanced and makes killing enemies easier.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Persona">Persona</a></em> series:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, if one of your allies is KO'ed in Tartarus, they'll just lie unconcious where they were and will have to be revived. If you leave the floor they're on without reviving them, they'll be sent back to the first floor and revived, but you won't be able to get them back until you return to the first floor as well.

However, if you die without paying your tab, Charon won't give you another chance, killing you for real.

Same thing for boss battles, except you'll be placed outside the room they're in. You get no penalty for dying. (Dying on higher difficulties automatically boots you back to the title screen. Hope you saved.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TooHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TooHuman">Too Human</a></em> respawns the player on-the-spot infinitely.

Which doesn't break at zero, only stops giving stat bonuses, and can be repaired at any time.

</li><li> Did you just die in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>? That's fine, you're just back to the latest checkpoint and even keep all the Exp and items you got. Even if a boss kills you: just go back to where's he patiently waiting for you. It can lead to an amusing situation where dying on the second fight against <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gadolt</span> puts you next to the warp gate you were going to take when he attacked, but trying to take it earns the player a "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButThouMust">You must defeat (boss name) first</a>" message.

In fact, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">intentionally dying</a> can give you the necessary bombs and special meter to set up a big scoring opportunity if you're low on resources, especially on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModePerks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardModePerks">Parallel mode, where there's no limit to how many extra lives you can get</a> (you get one every 15 million points, unlike the lower two difficulty levels that offer only up to four from scoring).

Cinematic is the standard "death = restart from last checkpoint," but Arcade has a respawn timer as long as at least one human-controlled player is alive. Considering it allows up to 4 human players, dying becomes much less of an issue. Players respawn with their character's standard weaponry, and some of them have weapons far superior to the standard rig (Clayton Carmine, for example, spawns with a Torque Bow, arguably the best weapon in the game), and always respawn with a fixed ammo count, meaning that suicide can be an attractive proposition for a player who is out of ammo.

Or faster, if you use the Super Jump to travel to a teammate's (hopefully safe) location. It is an inconvenience in that it gives your opponents a few seconds of free reign to cover territory or accomplish the objective, but for the most part, it isn't that big of an issue unless your team losing badly.

In fact, if you know you missed too many Gold Rings to open the forcefield, actively wrecking your craft is faster than waiting until you arrive at the end of the course and are told you didn't get enough.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crackdown">Crackdown</a></em>, the only <em>possible</em> penalty for dying is losing any gang weapons you may have picked up but hadn't yet stored at a supply point, which is pretty rare an occasion. Since you get full ammo reload and get to choose where to respawn, killing yourself is actually pretty useful at times as a rapid transit method. This is even acknowledged by the developers, as there is a suicide option in the main menu. It gets even more useful in the sequel, where you no longer have to unlock the respawn locations and also get a vehicle of your choice delivered every time you respawn.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CubeWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CubeWorld">Cube World</a></em> has you keep all items, experience, and money when you die. You respawn at a slightly random checkpoint, which can get annoying since you tend to respawn quite a distance from where you died. However, respawning a distance away from your death spot is intentional in order to prevent the player from being repeatedly killed by enemies that could camp at a spawn point.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGodfather">The Godfather</a>: The Game</em> (at least the Wii version), death is pretty laughable. For example: Let's say you're at the point of the game where you need to go start bombing the armories of other families to take control of various parts of the city. You shoot your way inside, inevitably triggering a mob war on your way in, you plant the bomb, and you, unfortunately, don't make it outside within the 10 second time limit. No worries; you're dead. You get transported to the nearest hospital, you don't lose any money, experience, health, skills, anything. On top of that, the bombing still counts, and you're declared the winner of the mob war you triggered. It is literally more advantageous to sit there and get blown up on purpose than to try to escape. The sequel expands this to enemy made men, who won't stay dead until a particular execution style is used on them.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIV">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></em> the penalty is removed completely, no dating required.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>, you don't lose your weapons or ammo when you die - just a fraction of your money, up to $5,000 dollars<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ydrj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ydrj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ydrj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and no, it can never exceed that, even if your character has millions</span>. After picking certain endings of the game (namely <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> endings A or C, in which case Franklin and Michael split ~20 million dollars between each other on top of the ~20 mil they each earned, or all three playable characters earn about 20 million dollars, respectively</span>) or with careful investments in the BAWSAQ stock market or property, this is not a big deal at all. In fact, it's worse to get arrested, in which case you DO lose all your ammo and have to go restock, which can be horrifically expensive. And with the cops <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceBrutality">more trigger happy than ever</a>, it's possible to complete the entire game without getting busted.
</li><li> Dying in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/InFAMOUS">inFAMOUS</a></em> bears virtually no penalty. At worst, you will have to start at an area rather far from the location where you died, or redo a small section of a mission you may have found particularly difficult. However, there is almost no load time between death and getting right back into the action, keeping any experience points you may have racked up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause">Just Cause 2</a></em> is another textbook example, unless you're on a mission (in which case you restart with what you had at the mission outset), you can continue with everything just as it was when you died (ammo, collectables and sabotage) , only you'll be sent to the nearest friendly base and thanks to the Black Market man <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> AKA Sheldon</span> you can head right back to where you left off.

You only lose a little bit of money, and there's <em>no</em> way to lose your weapons in the whole game (all weapons you acquire are permanently stored in your crib). It also allows players who die during missions to start again immediately without any in-game consequences, and some longer missions even have checkpoints that allow you to restart at a later point <em>in the same mission</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScrapLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScrapLand">Scrapland</a></em>. Thanks to The Great Database, anyone who dies will immediately be revived (provided their matrix is still listed in The Great Database, that is). That said, if you don't have any extra lives, you will respawn in jail.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em>. Death isn't even a slap on the wrist. Hell, it's even beneficial sometimes. Need to get back to your home planet quickly because it's under attack? Just commit suicide. Almost makes the Shaman type civilization's ability unnecessary.

One short loading time later, and you're put within walking distance of your death spot with a full ammo refill to boot! Though if the same happens during a mission, all your progress for said mission will be lost. (You still get to keep any XP earned during the failed attempt, however.
</li><li> Dying in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WatchDogs">Watch_Dogs</a></em> carries virtually no penalty whatsoever; at the very worst, youll have to restart the current mission.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArkhamHorror">Arkham Horror</a></em>, being reduced to zero stamina or sanity is a trip to the hospital/sanitarium instead of the morgue. You will lose half of your items but you get to choose and you round down. Being <em>devoured</em> on the other hand is the end for your investigator.
</li><li> From its first (Advanced) edition onward, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> has always had a "raise dead" spell that clerics could eventually learn. Once you reach high enough level, coming back from the dead is just a matter of having enough gold pieces' worth of gems and resting for a week afterward. At higher levels, clerics learn the "resurrection" spell, which can bring a character back from the dead with <em>full hit points</em>, ready to wade right back into battle, even if the only piece of him remaining intact before the resurrection was a single toe. For even higher level clerics, there is True Resurrection. Which brings you back to life even if your enemies killed you, burned your body, then divided your ashes into four urns and scattered them all in seperate continents, possibly over twenty years ago. <em>Well</em> over in fact; the rule for True Resurrection is that it can revive anyone killed within 10 years ago per caster level, and the lowest caster level a cleric can have and use it is 17. True Resurrection also has absolutely no drawbacks for the character being brought back, unlike Resurrection and Raise Dead which cause the loss of one level. It got so crazy, that spells like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Soul Bind</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Imprisonment</a> were created specifically so people had SOME way of keeping dead characters under wraps. Death of old age, though, can't be negated by any Resurrection spell.
<ul><li> In 5e, the spell Revify was added, which as long as the tagets body is still complete enough to function and their death has taken place in the last minuet(battles will practically never last that long)it allows you to bring someone back in about six secounds, with no side effects. Dying doesn't even mean your out of the fight.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em>, characters have cortical stacks and backups that can be downloaded into a new morph after death— though there's no guarantee your new body will be anything like your old one (unless you have good enough insurance), and if restored from backup, you lose all memory and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExperiencePoints">rez</a> gained since you last checked in.
</li><li> Not always the case, but dying can be harmless or even beneficial in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Munchkin">Munchkin</a></em>. Dying makes you lose all items and all cards in your hands, which is very bad if you've been building up a huge stockpile. However, on your next turn after death, you get a new hand of cards. If you had nothing, there's a chance you'll finally get some bonuses.

While a character resurrected in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> would lose an actual character level (and thus all class features that came with it), Pathfinder replaced this drawback with "negative levels". They don't <em>lose</em> any abilities, but their abilities are weakened until the negative levels have been removed, which can be done with certain healing spells. The main downside is that resurrection magic and spells to remove negative levels all require expensive materials to cast, but after a certain point the price is minor compared to how much money the character would have available.

Also, certain cards can take advance of the death of the monsters.
<ul><li> Hootcake: Banish a monster from the graveyard, special summon a Madolche (other than Hoot) from the deck.
