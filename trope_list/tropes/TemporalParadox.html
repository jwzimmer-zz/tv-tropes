</p><p>Punishments for creating a paradox vary. You might instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetGone">vanish from history</a> or cause your time-travelling self to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuffOfLogic">erased</a>; you might be immune but find the world around you different; you might <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityBreakingParadox">destroy reality itself</a>; heck, you might even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDoom">accidentally unleash</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockRoaches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockRoaches">killer flying time monkeys</a>.
</p><p>This is all fictional, of course. In reality, a confirmed paradox would disallow time travel to work <em>at all</em>. You see, a logical paradox is not a <em>thing</em>, due to the law of noncontradiction. A paradox is merely a sign in a human-created model that either you have attempted something impossible or that you have incomplete understanding of how something works. Here's the thing: all our notions of causality are based on the fact that time only moves in the one direction and a paradox exploits this cause and effect relationship. Once you throw <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> into the equation and have time move in a different way, it's really anyone's guess what will happen. Not that this prevents authors from abusing the concept as a sort of universe-wide <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb">Logic Bomb</a>.

</p><p></p><h1><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherParadox">Grandfather Paradox</a></h1>
<p>This paradox gets its name for a very simple question: "what would happen to you if you went back in time and killed your grandfather before he had offspring?" (Parodied by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama">Futurama</a></em>; see example in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>)
</p><p>More generally, this means doing something that <strong>makes your time travel <em>impossible</em> or <em>unnecessary</em>.</strong> For instance, if success in the time travel endeavor means that the condition you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">set out to change</a> never happens, then you won't ever have had any reason to come back and try to change it. Thus, without your intervention, it will happen after all, meaning you then must go back to change it, meaning you don't have to, meaning you have to, and so on, ad infinitum.

</p><p></p><h1>Ontological Paradox</h1>
<p>The kind of paradox that occurs in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> if you're not <em>very careful</em> about what you're doing, involving events that are their own causes. While not a paradox in the strictest sense - events remain self-consistent - it does violate normal expectations in surprising ways<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0vtaf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0vtaf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0vtaf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Quantum physics comes into play, see discussion</span>. Common variations include:
</p><p></p><h2>The Object Loop</h2>
An object from the future is sent into the past, takes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">The Slow Path</a> back to the future, and then gets sent back into the past again, in the same way, for the same purpose. For example, you travel to the past and sell a pair of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome">antique glasses you got from a friend</a>, who inherited them from his grandfather, who bought them from you, the time traveler. This time loop results in several important physics problems, such as:
<p><em>Where did the glasses come from in the first place?</em> The glasses have literally sprung into existence from <em>nothing</em>, appearing to violate the law of conservation of energy/mass. This is sometimes called a "closed timelike curve" in hard SF, and the object itself is sometimes referred to as a "jinn"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1eguc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1eguc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1eguc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As in the beings mentioned in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheQuran">The Qur'an</a>, not the liquor</span>.
</p><p><em>How does the object escape erosion or other forms of damage?</em> Since its origin point is also its end point, the object cannot (relative to itself) loop endlessly as it would experience infinite decay (relative to itself) and therefore would not exist to be sent to the past, preventing the loop from occurring at all. Thus, to exist the object must (improbably) escape all forms of damage/erosion/entropy between its arrival and departure; technically, this isn't impossible, but its improbability makes object loops very weird from a quantum mechanics perspective.
</p><p>In one common variation, <em>information</em> loops, rather than physical objects: for instance, an engineer from the future gives <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIVTheVoyageHome">the formula for transparent aluminum to its historical "inventor"</a>, becoming the creator of a metal that has always existed. This version may avoid the problem of decay, provided that the information is correctly transmitted and recorded. The actual effect of this variation is that no one invented the object, or no one discovered the formula/concept. It's just there.
</p><p>The object could also be repaired, or otherwise reset to a certain state, at some point during its existence; this would be the closest to creation the object experiences. This is a variant of an information loop, in that the object contains or suggests information (what it should be like) that is used (along with whatever remains of the damaged object) to create the like-new object.
</p><p></p><h2>The Reverse Grandfather Paradox</h2>
When time travel is involved, cause and effect tend to get muddled. Say you remember being involved in an accident as a child, and would have died if not for the intervention of a mysterious stranger who showed up, saved your life and then vanished without a trace. Later, you become a time traveler and find yourself at the scene of the accident, and there's a little kid who needs saving. That's right: <em>you</em> happen to be the mysterious rescuer. Instead of accidentally making your time travel unnecessary or impossible by meddling with the past, your meddling somehow made it required or possible in the first place. But then the question becomes how you <em>originally</em> (an increasingly meaningless concept in this context) survived to time-travel and save yourself.
<p>Thus, an ontological paradox occurs, which is not actually a paradox in the logical sense, but a confusing and counter-intuitive result of time travel. This also precludes a multiverse explanation, since both child and rescuer-adult occupy the same timeline and universe, if the child has a childhood-memory of being rescued by the adult-self.
</p><p>Normally, as written, the temporal paradox never turns out to be as dangerous as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProfessor">The Professor</a> imagined it would be, or it turns out the characters were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">"supposed to do it"</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAlreadyChangedThePast">in the original timeline</a>. The latter ontological paradox is also known as a predestination paradox, and the resultant philosophical questions are rarely thought about in the series.
</p><p>If two time periods are featured, the effects of a paradox will usually be visible in the future only "after" the cause has happened in the past (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeanwhileInTheFuture">Meanwhile, in the Future</a>).
</p><p>Interestingly, series rarely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">have the same result to paradoxes even in the same show.</a>
</p><p>The most common effect of a paradox, on TV at least, is to trigger the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a> and unmake the entire episode's consequences.
</p><p>Theoretically, a paradox that consists of two mutually-exclusive events can have one of two results: either the fabric of reality rips itself apart trying to determine which reality is the 'correct' one, or — according to Multiverse Theory — it's discovered that causing a paradox is a technical impossibility, as each supposed 'paradox' merely creates two 'alternate' timelines — one for 'Situation A' and another for 'Situation B'.
</p><p>(Of course, Multiverse Theory also holds that time-travel is <em>hypothetically</em> possible — since every choice made, and every action taken, and every word ever written, creates a series of 'alternate universes', each being slightly different to account for the results of the choice/action/word, we would just need a consistent way to travel 'between' the various 'multiverses' thus created.) On the flip side, it also means that it's impossible to <em>completely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">Set Right What Once Went Wrong</a>, as the "original" timeline will always be unchanged.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AkiraToriyama">Akira Toriyama</a> follows the multiverse approach in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: Future Trunks travels back in time to change the past, although he knows that this will not affect his own past or future (since each timeline exists as a separate dimension, changes made in one time line will not affect the others). Because Cell was also traveling around, but then Trunks prevents Cell's trip, fans have theorized that there are at least five time lines: the time line chronicled by the anime and manga (Line 1), the time line Trunks-who-participates-in-the-Cell-Games (this is Future Trunks, mentioned above) originates from (Line 2), and the time line Cell-who-killed-Trunks-to-steal-the-time-machine-and-terrorized-the-main-series-time-line originates from (Line 3), plus two theoretical/implied time lines. The first implied time line is the one visited by the Trunks native to Line 3, the Trunks killed by Cell so that he could go back to Line 1. This time line would proceed identically as Line 1 up to the point of Cell's discovery; after that, all fans have been able to guess is that the androids were somehow defeated. The commonly-accepted (suggested by the Daizenshuu guidebooks) theory is that Bulma built the deactivation switch (just like she did in Line 1) but Kuririn didn't destroy it, and Trunks took it back to Line 3 to use on the androids there. (Of course, it was the very discovery of Cell that lead Trunks and Kuririn back to Dr. Gero's lab in order to get the blueprints Bulma used to build the switch... so maybe Piccolo defeated them...?) The <em>other</em> theoretical time line is one Cell <em>would</em> have visited, if the Trunks native to Line 2 didn't kill him, using the strength gained from his training in Line 1. This line would proceed identically to Line 1 up until Cell's discovery, as well, so the Trunks visiting this time line probably won't be strong enough to defeat Cell, if he comes from a time line where Cell is waiting to kill him if he kills the androids and...

<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a> has a simple solution for this in the novel trilogy <em>Time's Arrow</em>. There are a large—but not <em>infinite</em>—number of alternate universes, that deal with what ifs. If someone in those timelines goes back in time to change something, it will create a new timeline that's an offshoot of one's own from that point. No going back and killing Hitler, Cyclops notes when told this—the idea being that if you do so, your <em>own</em> timeline will be unaffected. Oddly, this doesn't seem to be the case in the comic universe.
<ul><li> Except when it is that way. You don't think that any two comic writers actually agree on how this stuff works, do you? That said, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EarthX">Earth X</a></em> series (including Universe X and Paradise X) suggests a couple of different versions of this. In the end, it is fundamentally, philosophically important that the idea that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">alternate universes branch off only as a result of time travel</span> is true.
<ul><li> This is generally accepted; however, it has been shown that Doctor Doom has invented technology that allows this rule to be broken in PAD's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XFactor">X-Factor</a> run.

</li><li> One run of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thunderbolts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Thunderbolts">Thunderbolts</a></em> ended with the present-Thunderbolts meeting the past versions of themselves.

Apparently, the Phantoms learned time travel before they learned space travel, and when a civil war broke out between them, each side tried using time travel to change the outcomes of important battles. If a side did so successfully, the other side would try to undo it, again and again, until finally, the constant meddling with the temporal flow destroyed their world, leaving them a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a> trapped in the dimension of Limbo who are little more than slaves to Immortus' will.

<ul><li> However, the effects of time travel are <em>different</em> in the various movies.

</li><li> The documentaries on the DVD set mention how the justification was that there's some entity that regulates time itself. The partial deletion over time of Marty, why both Jennifers fainted when they met each other, and why even with relatively major changes to the timeline, Marty's family, home, and association with Doc Brown and Jennifer remain largely the same. They wanted to explore this aspect, but couldn't find a way to incorporate it into the films without it being obtrusive. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">The Other Wiki</a> has more information <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_timeline#Time_Travel_Theory">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

In extreme cases - such as when someone controls enough feng shui sites to cause a critical shift (i.e. they change reality) - people can get written out of the timeline entirely; they still exist, but they have no past in the current timeline, because their version of history simply doesn't exist anymore.
</li><li> The German RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye">The Dark Eye</a></em> takes a similar approach in declaring time a dynamic, "healing" weave. An example to solve the grandfather paradox is to have the person get stranded in time, get a life, meet a woman, marry and have kids and thus becoming his own grandfather.

<ul><li> Paradox is notably averted in every instance of time travel, where it's put forth that causality is <em>never</em> sacrificed. If a time traveler were to go back and kill his/her grandfather, even though another one of them wouldn't be born as a result, they've already caused the event, so they'll still exist. Changes due to time travel are likened to "overwriting" the original timeline (though it's also worth mentioning that, within the Schlockiverse, time travel is normally impossible).

(Short reason why- they wanted to prevent the activation of a device that was currently in the process of destroying the Galaxy.) Kevyn ends up shooting the version of the probe that hadn't been sent <em>yet</em>, arguing that even if they repair it, it wouldn't be identical enough to cause the "identity crisis" in the onboard AI that caused them to discover the duplication to begin with, thereby showing that "the future" could be change, without voiding their personal past. So, go ahead and send someone back far enough, make the change, and don't worry about disappearing in a puff of logic.

One obvious example is the episode in which Bill and Ted neglect to buy Bill's father an antique railroad watch as a birthday present, to replace the one he lost as a child. Ted's initial plan is actually perfectly sound: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">take the original watch from Bill's father when he 'loses' it in the past, then give it to him in the present.</a> This plan fails however, so they travel even further back in time to obtain the watch <em>before</em> Bill's father inherits it.

Likewise, given his origins even Pre-Crisis involved someone copying Superman, how does Bizarro continue to exist as well? This also applies, to a lesser extent, to the others. Sinestro's crimes were exposed by Hal Jordan; maybe eventually, someone else would have, but it was Hal's newbie attitude that caused him to question an otherwise model Green Lantern; shift the timeframe and he maybe never meets the LoD. Most Cheetah origins have Wonder Woman involved in some way, at least some as Cheetah feeling challenged by her existence. Also, take Luthor grabbing Abin Sur's ring. That might get the Guardians' attention. Also, without those three, and especially Big S, would the SF have even formed, and since the LoD formed out of fear of this groupthe list goes crazy on. Ah, everyone know time travelers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">surrounded by a temporal bubble</a> that prevents them from being affected by their own alterations in the timesteam.

<ul><li> Well, if we just accept that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> there is no 'beginning' to the Lars and Fry cycle, then it all works out nicely. Fry says "Ow, my larynx", but it comes out as "Lars", at which point he realises "Oh hey, I look and sound like Lars now, I guess I <em>am</em> Lars!"</span>
</li><li> Additionally, the temporal tattoo is an ontological paradox. At the end of the movie, Bender peels it off Lars's ass, takes it back in time, and puts it on the present Fry's ass. Thus, it was never actually created, and just loops through time eternally with no beginning or end.
</li><li> Fry's genetic material. Being his own <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> paternal grandfather</span>, the question is where exactly the information carried on his y-chromosome originated.
</li><li> One episode had Leela being the campaign manager of a Senator who had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SetRightWhatOnceWentWrong">traveled back in time to become the president of the world in order to prevent an apocalypse.</a> He wins the election, but unfortunately invokes a paradox, which is explained by Bender. Since he changed the past, that would mean that he wouldn't have traveled back in time in the first place. The Senator disappears via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">Reset Button</a>, and Nixon is reelected.
<ul><li> Not only that, he went back in time using the same method as in the aforementioned movie. So much for "paradox-free" time travel.
</li><li> This brings along <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a>, since this means that in about 20 years, there will be an apocalypse led by robots.
</li><li> This same paradox occurs in "The Why of Fry" with the Scootie Puff, Sr. but there it works out just fine (Fry tells Nibbler in the past to give him a better escape craft during the Infosphere mission, the Nibblonians give him one, and he escapes before the quantum interface bomb sends the Infosphere to the other dimension, which is not what happened the first time and invalidates the event that made it possible for him to go back in time in the first place).
</li></ul></li><li> Most if not all of the above is due to said "Paradox-Free" time travel actually being "Paradox-<em>correcting</em>" time travel: paradoxes come into existence repeatedly, but radiate enough doom that the universe actively kills them before they can do any damage.

<ul><li> In <em>Strange Attractors</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamSleator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamSleator">William Sleator</a>, almost any time travel to the past causes instability in the universe. As those instabilities add up, the entire universe can "go chaotic", essentially becoming a huge mass of paradoxes. The only noticeable effect of this is that electrical lighting flickers. In fact the timeline in the series is so fragile you can cause paradoxes by going so much as five minutes into the <em>future</em>.
</li><li> In Ted Chiang's short story <em>The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate</em>, the titular gate can transport anyone exactly twenty years into the future, or twenty years back. This leads to increasingly more improbable shenanigans, starting with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a> involving a treasure map, and reaching its arguable peak when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a character's wife meets her husband's younger self in the past, takes him to the bedroom, and upon descovering his lack of the, er, skills that the husband has in the present, teaches him how to please a woman, over the course of weeks. It's also implied that the husband married her in the present because, when he saw her, she reminded him of the middle-aged woman who took his virginity.</span>
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LSpragueDeCamp">L. Sprague de Camp</a>'s short story "A Gun for Dinosaur," four characters (two hunters and two guides) travel to the Cretaceous period for a dinosaur-hunting safari. One of the hunters, Holtzinger, is killed by a tyrannosaur, and the other, James, is blamed for his death because he recklessly fired the shots that woke the dinosaur up. Later, James, swearing revenge, tries to go back to just before the expedition arrived so he can kill the guides once they emerge from the time machine. Instead, the space-time continuum snaps him back to the present to prevent a paradox, killing him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">messily</a>.
</li><li> The novel <em>Ice And Blood</em> manages to produce a very strange reverse grandfather paradox. ZJ is a depressed, bipolar paranoid schizophrenic who has no memories of his childhood. He hates his life enough to deliberately break into a lab where time travel technology exists, he goes back to the past, and he kills his parents in the hopes he'll stop existing. Instead the violent and bloody deaths they suffer triggers his past self's mental illness. The obvious problem with this is that there's no guarantee that ZJ would suffer the exact same breakdown and block out his memories every time, nor is there any logical reason that depressed ZJ would ever go this route again when suicide would be significantly easier for him. It just doesn't work from a logic standpoint. (It's still a good read if you apply enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra">MST3K Mantra</a> to it.)

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Tabletop Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel">Time Travel</a> RPG <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Continuum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Continuum">Continuum</a></em>, if a time traveler creates a paradox, they accumulate "frag," and if they accumulate too much, it eventually causes them to unravel. What's more, unchecked temporal paradoxes will eventually lead to the unraveling of reality itself. (On the other hand, the game totally mindscrews you with the fact it manages to be utterly fatalistic about it: the fact the universe itself exists, even if there is a paradox in existence, means that — at some point — the temporal paradox will be/does get/has been fixed, by the Continuum. It's just a matter of who or what becomes collateral damage in the process of fixing it.) Much of the game centers around the players, who are part of "The Continuum", trying to fix paradoxes deliberately created by time travelers (known as "narcissists") who don't believe the official line on paradoxes and who want to mess with the timeline for their own personal gain.
<ul><li> Similarly, the expansion sourcebook (currently trapped in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>) <em>Narcissist</em> has a different take on this — the original time traveler entered the "main" timeline's past and introduced time travel sometime around 14000 BC. Said time travel directly resulted in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">singularity</a> around 2400 AD, which then used its super-powerful minds and infinite resources to make <em>sure</em> that said time traveler never leaves our timeline (which would require a portal made out of X number of Temporal Paradoxes), and that time travelers don't cause the timeline to deviate from the history that led to the singularity. In alternate timelines away from "the swarm" — agents of the Singularity, named that because there's a lot of them, but they're disorganized idiots — paradoxes <em>don't exist</em>: "frag" exists in the main timeline specifically due to the singularity's agents constantly trying to time-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> anyone attempting to change history.
</li></ul></li><li> Time Travel is rare in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspaceIsAScaryPlace">the Warp</a> does strange things sometimes, which may result in a ship setting out to answer what turns out to be its own distress signal. In another example, one kleptomaniac Ork Warboss was sent back through time via warp-storm, met up with his past self, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsaneTrollLogic">killed his temporal doppelganger so he could have two copies of his favorite gun</a>.

As the game puts it, it turns out the universe doesn't particularly care if your grandmother gets shot and there's no shooter — barring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimePolice">external intervention,</a> you pop out of existence if you pull the trigger and the bullet hits home.

Timmy goes back in time to find out why Crocker was so miserable and to try to fix it. He finds out that as a child, Crocker <em>himself</em> had fairy godparents—and that they were Cosmo and Wanda, something that they don't remember—and figures out that he must've done something to lose his fairies. He tries to warn the young Crocker, but inadvertently ends up being the one who reveals the secret (with some help from both '70s Cosmo <em>and</em> modern Cosmo's stupidity). Furthermore, as Jorgen shows up to erase everyone's memories of there being fairies, young Crocker manages to get his hands on the DNA tracker that AJ had built so that they'd know when Crocker was around, <em>and</em> managed to get Cosmo's DNA to use in it, <em>and</em> managed to covertly write a memo on the back of it that fairy godparents exist without Jorgen noticing, allowing him to keep that knowledge after his memory of fairies was erased...which means that if Timmy had never interfered, Crocker would be neither miserable nor fairy-obsessed. However, whereas when Timmy left for the past, Crocker was using a very primitive and likely useless "fairy finder", the Crocker in the present that Timmy returned to was using the tracker that AJ had built, implying that he <em>had</em> created an alternate timeline, and leaving one to wonder what happened in the original timeline. Of course, considering it's explicitly stated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> that few kids keep their fairies past their first year, much less until adulthood when they would leave <em>anyway</em>, we can guess...
<ul><li> Well the original timeline seems to be that 70's Cosmo is that cause of Crocker losing him and Wanda. Timmy then stops this incident only for present day Cosmo to turn on the mic while Timmy is talking and cause the incident to happen anyway. While this doesn't explain how Crocker knew about the existence of fairies after his mind was wiped in the original timeline, since we don't see the original incident play out, we can just assume any number of reasons for that. (Perhaps he managed to write a note in that timeline too.)

Reality itself falls apart, so he decides to go to the beginning of time and do it all over again. Batman and Green Lantern manage to reset history. Batman also manages to create a close <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndIMustScream">And I Must Scream</a> moment by trapping him in an eternal loop of his wife's naggery.
