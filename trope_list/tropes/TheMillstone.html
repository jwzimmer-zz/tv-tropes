</div></div><p>Things tend to go wrong in drama; this is how drama persists. And when something goes wrong, it's usually the fault of The Millstone.
</p><p>The Millstone is the character, usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">The Ditz</a>, who is specifically responsible for the failure of every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plan">plan</a> that the heroes carry out. It's not just that the Millstone isn't helpful; it's that they manage to make things worse for their side than if they'd done nothing at all. It's because of them that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">Failure Is the Only Option</a>. For some reason, they're usually given the linchpin of this week's plan... which they will then botch, forcing the heroes to try again next week. If the main characters could just get rid of the Millstone, they'd be home free... but then the show would be over; see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">Just Eat Gilligan</a>.

</p><p>The trope name comes from the phrase "millstone around my neck". For those not versed in agriculture, a millstone is a large stone disc (often two or three feet in diameter and weighing several hundred pounds) used by mills to render things well pulverized, such as grinding grain into flour. Imagine carrying one of those around your neck — you'd be hard-pressed to do much of anything. The expression originates from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">Matthew 18:6</a> ("...whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea"), which in turn may be a reference to a form of capital punishment practiced at the time.

<ul><li> Excel Excel from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> is an example. Granted, most of Il Palazzo's plans are rather silly to begin with, but she ensures that they have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">no chance of success</a>.
<ul><li> Near the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">anime series</a>, Il Palazzo realizes this and fires her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by shooting her through the chest and leaving her to die</span>; he conquers the city two episodes later (though the city's destruction might have helped with that a little).
</li><li> In the manga Excel is so much of a millstone that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when Il Palazzo finally gets off his ass and does something (such as exploring outside of the lair), he only rescues Elgala and Hyatt, and leaves Excel behind, replacing her with a disguised Roppomatsu 1 he also captured, and almost immediately succeeds in taking over the city</span>. Interestingly, manga Excel is considerably more intelligent than her anime counterpart, even though her hyperactive attitude tends to make it hard to tell. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Il Palazzo's success doesn't seem to be so much due to Excel's absence than it is from memory and competence returning to him — which was also the reason he ditched Excel.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, comically ditzy Italy spends most of his time dragging down the Axis powers.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn">Katekyō Hitman Reborn!</a></em> has the protagonist, Tsunayoshi Sawada, at least in terms of sports. Any team that picks him for a game loses. He <em>does</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInBadass">take a level</a>, though.
</li><li> Tonpa in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter">Hunter × Hunter</a></em> actively <em>tries</em> to be one during one part of the Hunter Exam when he's forced to team up with the main characters, voting opposite the others whenever they're forced to take a vote, immediately forfeiting his match in a best 3-out-of-5 battle, and encouraging dissent between the other members of the group. He even states that he has no desire to pass the exam, and only took it so he could crush the hopes of everyone else taking it.
<ul><li> Ironically, Tonpa forfeiting his match actually <em>helped</em> the main characters. The convicts they were up against were encouraged to delay the group for as long as possible until the time limit ran out, getting a year off their sentence for every hour they succeeded in doing so. Kurapika points out that if Tonpa hadn't forfeited, his opponent probably would've crushed his trachea so he couldn't speak and then just tortured him for the remainder of the time limit.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>, a villainous example in Team Rocket. In any episode where they are not the primary antagonists, they will do something to screw up the other villain's plan. Somewhat ironically they usually subvert this on the heroic side. Not only are they usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionPromotion">far more efficient doing good than bad</a>, but a lot of their bumbling schemes ultimately end up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">resolving a crisis or personal conflict</a> between the current cast.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>, the brainwashed Prince Endymion is this to Kunzite. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon">Noble Demon</a> and goes out of his way to sabotage Kunzite's cunning, unethical schemes, but Kunzite can't just leave him behind because Queen Beryl wants Endymion out there doing stuff.
</li><li> The second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Shirobako">Shirobako</a></em> introduces one in the form of Shinsuke Chazawa, the editor for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> <em>Third Aerial Girls' Squad</em> manga that the main characters are trying to adapt to an anime. Given the lengths he goes to hinder MusuAni in producing the series, up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> deliberately doing everything he can to prevent the director from communicating with the manga's author</span>, it'd be understandable for a viewer to think that he was deliberately being paid to sabotage production (he's not; he's just resentful of anything that gets in the way of his leisure time). A conservative estimate would be that at least half of all the problems in the second season are his fault.

He later began to suspect Bunnie of being the traitor based on the information that she had left without telling anyone, but Sonic, who was already about to strangle him for accusing Antoine, finally blew a fuse and dished out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a> to Silver, telling him that there <em>was</em> no traitor and that his friends were all better heroes than a "flake" like Silver could ever hope to be before finally ordering him to just pack up and go home because all he's doing is screwing things up; upon discovering that Silver is currently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInThePast">Trapped in the Past</a>, Sonic just flat-out tells him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetOut">Get Out!</a>.
<ul><li> Silver did turn out to be right about a traitor of sorts being present... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's Sally Acorn, who has become Roboticized (prior to the universe reset).

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Leeroy Jenkins</a> tendencies often end up making things harder for the rest of the team. Case in point: on two occasions, the Runaways have tried to flee from more powerful or better-trained opponents, and in both cases, Chase decided to lay down covering fire, compromising the stealth advantage conferred by the Leapfrog's cloaking systems.

Unable to adjust to a world where her friends have nearly all grown up while she is still largely the same person she was before her death, she pushed them into reuniting.

In the first part depicting their past, the Minions accidentally sent a T-rex into a volcano, got a caveman eaten by a bear, crushed a pharaoh and his subjects with a pyramid, exposed a vampire to sunlight during an ill-planned surprise party, and accidentally shot Napoleon with a cannon.

Later, when they are attempting to hide from the zombies in a pub, he turns on the fruit machine. He also gets a bit too caught up in the excitement of dealing with the zombies violently, thus needlessly endangering everyone else several times for the thrills. Unlike many examples here, however, Shaun actually twigs on and angrily berates Ed for it (thus, rather amusingly, becoming something of a Millstone himself, since his spleen-venting unfortunately occurs right in front of the zombies).

She insists on not leaving Phillip behind even though he's already been bitten and is a dead man walking, then when Shaun, Diane and David are stuck with a newly-zombified David at the back of the car, Barbara just stands there until Liz opens the childlocked doors for them and it's strongly implied that when the party pass through the garden of a couple she knows, Barbara <em>opens the sliding door</em> even though she can clearly see they're zombies, thus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> getting bitten</span>.

</li><li> The protagonist "Ace" Rothstein himself is often millstone. He knowingly marries a hooker and hustler and is constantly driven up the wall by her lies and attempts to steal his money to give to her pimp. Ace makes an enemy of the county commissioner by firing an incompetent employee who also happens to be his brother in-law. This ruins Ace's chances of getting a casino license. Then he gets a job as a talk show host in the casino to keep running it, which makes the bosses very nervous because they want to keep the skim operation under the radar and quiet as possible.

She makes things more difficult for Batman when they flee the museum simply by not running when she had the chance. Some minutes later, she almost gets Batman killed — and then almost publicly unmasked — by lying to him about her weight when he tries using a motorized cord to pull them up to the roof.

His stupidity ultimately proves to be his undoing when he takes a shit in Butch's old apartment and leaves his gun outside the bathroom for Butch to find and use on him. To make this extra brainless, the only reason Vincent was alone in the apartment was because his boss had just stepped out to get doughnuts. He'd probably have survived if he'd just waited an additional five minutes to use the toilet, instead of knowingly putting himself in the most vulnerable position possible.
</li><li> The casual viewer may not notice at first because he's the closest to a "main" protagonist, but every major problem the team faces in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ghostbusters1984">Ghostbusters (1984)</a></em> is caused by Dr. Peter Venkman. The Dean at Columbia U specifically cites his smarmy attitude and freewheeling approach to the scientific method as the reasons for kicking the team off campus, his overly-forward attempts to hit on Dana almost cost them their first customer, and his antagonizing of EPA agent Walter Peck backfires horribly when Peck turns out to be a petty tyrant who orders their containment grid shut down, freeing hundreds of trapped ghosts and speeding along the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>'s plan. Despite this, Venkman can be considered a subversion of the usual Millstone, since it's his cleverness, resourcefulness, and silver tongue that always end up fixing the problems he causes.
</li><li> Mina in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BramStokersDracula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BramStokersDracula">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a></em>. Because she is in love with the Count, she serves as a heavy burden to the vampire hunters trying to kill him and they use her psychic connection with him to track him down. She fully transitions to this trope during the climax, when she casts a spell to bring down the sunlight and summon nightfall earlier, which would allow Dracula to come out in full strength and place all the hunters in danger.

The guy's job is to be muscle for the mob, so pushing people around and keeping everybody in line is what he's supposed to be doing. The problem is Tommy is an unrepentant, loud-mouthed jackass who flies into a murderous rage at the slightest provocation, which in the long term causes more problems than it solves. Unlike most examples, Tommy's instability winds up getting him killed when his bosses realize he's too much trouble to control.

(Forcing the family to skip several stops they wanted to make because he throws a tantrum whenever his naps are interrupted, constantly trying to run away to find a pig they had won at a fair and were forced to give up, etc.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It isn't until the end of the book that he finally manages to vindicate himself by getting the family out of trouble by way of his surprisingly fluent Spanish...even if it was just to go back to a petting zoo where the Heffleys had left the aforementioned pig.</span>

Martin's first novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DyingOfTheLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DyingOfTheLight">Dying of the Light</a></em>, this role could actually be used to describe the <em>protagonist</em> at best, or almost <em>all of the named characters</em> at worst. The plot is largely driven by the main characters inadvertently making things worse for everyone around them as well as themselves, with first place going to the Protagonist, and second place going to his love interest whose jaw-droppingly bad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">lack of communication</a> sets up their backstory and prolongs the plot. It also doesn't help that there's a character that seems to be an early version of Littlefinger pulling some strings, but at least he's <em>trying</em> to cause issues.

<ul><li> Joffrey "Baratheon" is as completely evil as a 13-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBrat">Royal Brat</a> can be... but this is NOT his family's biggest problem. It's his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">utter stupidity</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviouslyEvil">cluelessness</a> which first causes a war and then slams constant thorns into the Lannisters' politics. Several times. All of his family members around him, who vary in terms of both intelligence and conscience themselves, spend half of their energy trying to knock if not morality, exactly, then at least some sense of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Pragmatic Villainy</a> into him; to no avail. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In fact, Joffrey's very life ends because some people finally decide that working around him is simply impossible.</span>
</li><li> Cersei picks up where her son left off, and it becomes perfectly clear where he got it from in the first place. While Joffrey at least had Tywin and Tyrion <em>attempting</em> to run interference, Cersei eventually doesn't have anyone keeping her (and her alcoholism) in check. Her tendency to fill her council with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes Men</a> and her petty feud with her daughter-in-law Margaery Tyrell end up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">delivering control of King's Landing to armed zealots who lock her up in a cell and the creation of a brand new pirate fleet (consisting of ships she bankrupt the Seven Kingdoms to build)</span>. Even Littlefinger is shocked by her incompetence. He fully expected her to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> run the Seven Kingdoms into the ground</span>, true (and planned around it)... but, not <em>that</em> quickly. He's had to speed things up on the fly.

As is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Ryman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Frey</a>... given that he is one of the heirs to the House, it's almost a relief for readers to learn that the vastly more competent and ruthless Black Walder is widely considered by the other Freys as being likely out to kill him (and others) to gain the lordship. Politically smooth and savvy the gormless, stubborn jackass <em>isn't</em> (he's smart enough in his own way, just not a socially acceptable soul by both Westerosi and Freyish standards). Which explains why no other Freys are moving to defend him against Black Walder and/or anybody else within or outside the family.
</li><li> Subverted/deconstructed ones come in the shapes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">Lord Edmure Tully</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbBlonde">Lancel Lannister</a>: others treat them with varying degrees of contempt, having pre-judged them to be Millstones. Which becomes clear is <em>the</em> actual root cause of problems they get blamed for when they are put in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">situations they just couldn't win</a> even if there were cheat codes available. Blaming them for not acting on things they were not aware of or not thinking of things they couldn't know about or going to people they shouldn't because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedOutOfTheLoop">you never told them important information</a> because you decided they were too dumb to fully trust, yet you still used them to do vitally important things...? Who is actually the Millstone, here?
</li><li> The absolute and undisputed star of the Millstones, however, is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigFancyCastle">Big Fancy Castle</a> rather than a person: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Harrenhal</a>. Ever since its fall to the Targaryens, it is reputed to curse the person who commands it and any family that holds it for long. While there appears to be something to this, even if this is just legend, the reputation is enough for cautious men to hand it off as soon as they possibly can. Additionally, being in a fairly strategic location means others will try to bring the current commander to ruin in wartime, so there's that, too. Almost <em>every</em> family and military commander given the castle has gone — often in remarkably over-the-top, horrific ways, even by Westerosi standards. Those that haven't completely died out have become, at best, poor, divested, bit-part players in the Game as a direct result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">trying to run the best-used-as-a-quarry-of-ready-dressed-stonework as a going concern</a>.
<ul><li> The current lord of Harrenhal is Littlefinger: he owns it, but is smart enough to neither stay near it, nor waste resources refurbishing it until he has the gold to tear it down. He is currently staying in the Vale, while letting other people take the immediate fallout.

He spends much of the war not being much help to his side, either militarily or because he's chasing after his uncle Daemon, who exploits this to keep Aemond away from places he and his dragon <em>could</em> be useful. Much as his mother and brother loved him, they probably did breath a sigh of relief when Aemond bought it, just because he wouldn't be around to screw things up for them any further.

On several occasions, mooks discovered the Animorphs' secret but deliberately avoided reporting it out of fear of getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveFailedMe">eaten</a>. That said, he's <em>still</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">an incredibly dangerous enemy</a> and for the majority of the series the Animorphs are having to repeatedly risk their lives foiling his plans. It's just implied that if Visser 1 had been in charge of the invasion instead, they wouldn't have had a prayer of stopping the Yeerks.

He ends up as the last of the team to be of any use in battle, the most determined to spur them on into progressively more dangerous stakes, and the one to use the magical horn - not only summoning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">the Beast</a> into their midst, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffinDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffinDeliveryService">giving the bastard a quick route to his real goal</a>.

<ul><li> There have been some bad partners throughout the 30-plus seasons of the American version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmazingRace">The Amazing Race</a></em>, but a season 15 contestant named Mika takes the cake.

Mika, who was afraid of both heights and water, refused to do it, even though the challenge took about thirty seconds from start to finish and they were in second to last place with a comfortable but not insurmountable lead on the last place team. She pitched a fit before getting floaties and still didn't do it. It took her so long to do it that the last place team got there, giving her a hard time limit of two minutes before she had to get out of the way for them. She had almost worked up the courage when the other team started to try to talk her out of it to (successfully) run the clock out. They jumped in front of Mika who then quit the task and got her and her boyfriend eliminated. He almost broke up with her right then and there, but ultimately waited to do it until they were at the sequester location where the eliminated teams wait until filming stops.
</li><li> Jesse from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em>, at least for the first few seasons. A lot of early episodes involve his addictions, his carelessness, his recklessness, or his insubordination causing problems. It's probably most evident in "4 Days Out", where the first half is basically nothing but Jesse causing problems (packing nothing but snacks for a desert trip, leaving the keys in the ignition for two days straight until the battery ends up drained, accidentally starting a fire and putting it out with their only water, wasting the remaining power in his cellphone to call an equally incompetent friend for help, who immediately gets lost). Naturally, though, he ends up proving his value later on, given his bloody-minded determination and growing moral compass.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> has Pierce, particularly in Season 2.

However, the later season episode "Josh Is Done" deconstructed this trope by demonstrating how much of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMillstone">The Millstone</a> Drake really is. Josh is finally pushed past his limit and states that he is "done" with Drake as a brother and firmly cuts him out of his life. Drake isn't too bothered by this initially because he thinks Josh needs him, but as the episode goes on, things in life proceed to improve for Josh while they deteriorate for Drake. Josh's relationship with his boss improves, a stress rash he's had for years suddenly goes away, he starts doing better in school, and has more time for friends and dating. Drake turns into a basket case who is unable to function because it turns out he relied on Josh for a lot of basic necessities in his life, is unable to focus on his music, and starts getting acne. It all culminates in Drake getting humiliated in chemistry class so badly he ends up running out, but not before apologizing to Josh for everything and for being a bad brother, and admitting he needs Josh way more than Josh needs him. Josh accepts Drake back after his apology.
</li><li> A typical episode of Ricky Gervais's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Extras" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Extras">Extras</a></em> would involve his character Andy divulging an embarrassing secret to his friend Maggie, who would inevitably spill the beans to someone in a position to humiliate him over it. Yet as Millstone-ish as Maggie could be, it is eventually Andy who is his own worst enemy, considering <em>he never learns to keep his mouth shut.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape">Farscape</a></em> had Rygel, and later, Noranti — both of whom were remarkably likely to cause serious trouble for the crew. The episode "Lava's A Many Splendored Thing", for example, had both of them take turns — Rygel got them trapped by trying to rob the crates, and Noranti repeatedly got them into trouble because she was convinced the bad guys were in fact the noble Tarkan freedom fighters, and nearly got them shot several times. While both of them could be useful in the right circumstances, using their diplomatic skills or potions and illusions respectively, they were also prone to setting off the plots of entire episodes through greed, apparent senility, or other forms of poor decision-making.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> with Joffrey. He is so utterly incompetent at anything that doesn't involve tormenting people, and so utterly devoted to the latter, that he never really sees the big political picture and ultimately creates problem after problem for the Lannisters who in Cersei and Tywin were trying to rule through him. This is one of the reasons why Tywin has no issue with Margaery trying to manipulate him, at least in the beginning, because then at least <em>somebody</em> is keeping him on a leash.
</li><li> A less intentional case of this happened with Tyrion due to his signature trait of high intelligence being stymied by an increasingly magnetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a>. A lot of the conflict in the seventh and eighth seasons essentially arose from characters giving him their ear—making alliances they shouldn't have, trusting people who were clearly not trustworthy, setting up battle plans that didn't work, holding off on attacking King's Landing until it was a much harder target, and most pivotally, the baffling expedition to kidnap a wight from beyond the Wall.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em>
<ul><li> If the other castaways had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustEatGilligan">resorted to cannibalism and eaten him</a>, they could have gotten off the island the next day. He's so much an embodiment of this trope that it was almost titled "The Gilligan".
</li><li> Also, the episodes that <em>didn't</em> center around their latest attempt to get off the island (and these made up about half the series) instead focused around the latest danger on the island, and Gilligan was always the one who saved them in those cases. So no Gilligan and maybe they'd have gotten off the island — or maybe they'd have been fried by the volcano or blown up by the mine that washed ashore.
</li><li> In one episode, they find a gold mine on the island, as well as a salvageable life raft from the Minnow. Everybody except Gilligan tries to sneak a bag of gold onto the raft, after being explicitly warned by the Professor not to. The raft sinks as soon as they shove off. Gilligan proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade the fact that he's usually the one to screw these things up</a>.
</li><li> Basically, Gilligan goes through life with a near-total lack of self-awareness. When this means that he doesn't think about the consequences of his actions, things turn out bad. When it means that he doesn't worry about his personal safety or waste effort on inconsequential things, things turn out well.
</li><li> Though Gilligan was the most consistent example, the rest of the castaways all had their moments of becoming this to one or more of the others as well. (Oftentimes if it wasn't Gilligan, it was either one of the Howells or Ginger.)

Later seasons have her repeatedly teaming up with Bud, and her involvement typically turns things into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Epic Fail</a> of Biblical proportions. (Except for that one episode where she invented <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Bleen</a>.)

Well, at least the egg is probably destroyed... or it would be, if it wasn't in Merlin's backpack.

Which is the true Millstone is too close to call, as they'll occasionally switch in the same episode. (see The Nightmare of Milky Joe) Their millstoning gets more prevalent when they leave the Zooniverse after season one, as Bob Fossil is no longer instigating episodes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMole">The Mole</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityTV">Reality TV</a> show built entirely around this trope. The players add money to a jackpot by performing tasks, which The Mole tries to sabotage. Somewhat subverted, though: Every so often, there is a quiz that asks about The Mole (which, naturally, The Mole aces every time), and whoever knows the least is eliminated. The players, in order to screw with each other's knowledge and extend their own games, don't always give it their all, and thus the entire team becomes The Millstone.

On at least three different occasions, her presence among the outlaws also turns several <em>other</em> characters into Millstones when they mess up the plans after getting distracted by whatever stupid mess she's managed to wander into.
</li><li> Neelix from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> caused nothing but trouble for Janeway and her crew. He destroyed a diplomatic gift Voyager gave as a way to please some violent natives, the Kazon (causing them to seek revenge and chase Voyager for several seasons), failed to find food and got a crew member killed when he was placed in charge of food gathering (this was by having the crewman do a useless task, collecting sun-dried bones for food use, alone without any thought about his safety) after the crew was marooned (even though Janeway found food in the cave <em>they were sleeping in</em>), since he said he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">survival expert</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">Poisoning the</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFail">ship</a></em> (not the crew, the actual <strong>ship</strong>) with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">cooking</a>. At one point, he even committed bona-fide, premeditated <em>treason</em>, with not even a slap on the wrist. Janeway not only made him morale officer, ship cook, but also a DIPLOMAT.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StepByStep">Step by Step</a></em>: Karen seems to fill this role often.
<ul><li> In one episode of the first season in which the family went camping, Karen says she had found a rock that would make a perfect "pedicure stand". Too bad that rock had been holding the truck they had all ridden to the campsite in place — and it ended up falling into the water.
</li><li> In another episode, when the family gets an answering machine, Karen only listens to the first message of two (that was for her) before leaving immediately. The second message is for Frank — telling him to not come to a site, that it would be demolished instead. Frank could have gotten injured — or worse — had he not gotten out in time. If the message had been relayed, this would not have happened.
</li></ul></li><li> This type of character is parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook">That Mitchell and Webb Look</a></em> in the "Get Me Hennimore!" sketches, where Hennimore inevitably screws up after his boss gives him two mutually exclusive and dangerous schemes and fails to properly explain which is which, such as denoting one room with the letter I and another with the number one, rendered as the Roman Numeral I! How can Hennimore <em>possibly</em> misunderstand that?
</li><li> Lori and Carl Grimes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>, particularly during the second season.

After reaching Morseby, she steals the truck and threatens you until you agree to gather supplies for everyone, resulting in a number of survivors being killed. Then she gets kidnapped by the gangs when she tries to help them, and you have to go rescue her, resulting in the person who went with her dying. Then, in a rage, she releases Ryder White's infected wife, and he shoots and kills them. But, not before taking the cure which actually transforms him into a monster. All in all, the party might've lasted much longer had Jin not been around.

</li><li> Hilary King is even worse. You have to beat him in a race for the story to continue, which is extremely hard. Not because he's so fast, but because he keeps getting himself killed due to game bugs that are triggered by his erratic driving. Worse is that his presence in the story is <em>entirely pointless</em>. You recruit him as the getaway driver for a bank robbery, but he won't work with you unless you prove yourself better than him in every way, by beating him in a race where he has a supercar and you have some dinky thing. Then when he finally needs to show his worth in the actual robbery getaway, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">immediately gets out of the car</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">starts shooting at the SWAT team</a>, and is instantly killed when they return fire.

He thinks he's a rapper, but is not shown to have any quality as a rapper (or any other profession, for that matter). Exactly why he deserves your help is unclear. The missions you get from him (none of which earn you any money, only an increase in CJ's respect stat) involve: helping take revenge on Freddy, a Vago who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">"supposedly" stole his rhymes as opposed to buggering him in prison and leaving his "macho pride" in shambles</a>; steal the rhyme book from Madd Dogg, an actual rapper, then a van with a sound system at a beach party<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ebb1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ebb1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ebb1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">between Loc being a complete joke and the people at the party just having a good time and doing no harm, you might actually feel bad when you ruin the party</span>; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingTheCompetition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingTheCompetition">kill Madd Dogg's manager</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note34k73');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note34k73" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note34k73');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">although he turns out to be involved with the Ballas, so he's a more acceptable target</span>... and after all this trouble, he just decides to violate his parole so he would go <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">back to jail</a>.

Despite the fact that Shepard is a Spectre, ostensibly with carte blanche from said Council to break any law and do anything s/he feel is necessary to complete his/her mission, <em>any</em> action Shepard takes is second-guessed by the Council, and vital information or resources are often withheld. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At one point in the first game, Shepard has to steal his/her own ship back because the Council put it on lockdown.

Also, if you are spotted, she often chooses to stand her ground and engage the limitless army of enemy troops, rather than attempt to hide like a good agent.

It turns out, while everyone else was out doing something else, and Ben was left guarding the boat, another group of survivors, who are essentially made up <em>of a doctor and elderly cancer patients</em>, are able to steal the boat. Everyone else is very rightfully angry at him for this.
</li><li> Jane, albeit being a <em>much</em> lesser example than Ben, rudely snatches the torch from his cold dead fingers and runs with it until her own death. She's the one who decides to mug the panicked and vulnerable Arvo, a youth who <em>clearly</em> could not have survived without protection from a group, because she decided she'd like his medicine, and she's the one who decides to "prove" Kenny's instability by harassing him about his dead family, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">pretending she lost his daughter to walkers</a>, and then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">antagonizing him about</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">that</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullyingADragon">until he snaps</a>. Of course, robbing Arvo causes his friends, armed with AK-47s, to come looking for revenge which results in the ultimate collapse of the group, and the latter very understandably causes Kenny to lose his shit and try to kill her which forces Clementine to decide either to intervene and kill Kenny or let him have at it. She's at least a competent survivor in her own right, very much unlike Ben, but every decision she makes is mind-numbingly stupid, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">antagonistic for the sake of being antagonistic</a>, and causes nothing but problems.

<ul><li> Right after you're released from the prison, Steve opens fire on you with a mounted machine gun. (To be fair there, he did think Claire was a zombie.)
</li><li> Claire needs some Gold Lugers to open a door, but taking them starts to set off a trap. Putting them back disarms the trap. After leaving the area, Steve tries to take the Gold Lugers, but is too dumb to put them back, forcing Claire to save him. As thanks for saving him, he then keeps the Gold Lugers and refuses to give them to you unless you give him "something fully automatic."
</li><li> When Claire finally finds something fully automatic for him, Ashford dumps them into a trap. Steve then uses all the ammo the guns have to kill about ten zombies and shoot a wall.
</li><li> Steve pops in when Ashford ambushes Claire, getting shot for his troubles and hitting Ashford with a wild shot. When they close in for the kill, Steve has Ashford at gunpoint for about twenty seconds before Ashford just runs away — and apparently the only reason Steve didn't shoot is because he was weirded out by Ashford being a transvestite.
</li><li> Since Ashford got away, he's able to both arm the self-destruct system and release a Tyrant to kill Claire and Steve.
</li><li> When that fails, Ashford takes control of the plane Steve's piloting to crash-land into <em>Antarctica</em>.
</li><li> While in Antarctica, Steve operates a drill, but gets distracted by Claire's butt. This causes him to lose control of the drill and forces Claire to find a gas mask to continue.
</li><li> Finally, Steve gets kidnapped and Claire has to deal with his monstrous form — and she can take any weapons she wants from the item box, forcing Chris to use the leftovers for the real final battle instead of the glorified cutscene battle.

Because they don't trust Sam or Lambert's plan, they go out of their way to actively hinder him such as calling in a bomb warning to the Cozumel police which puts the entire cruise ship on lock-down and swarming with police when Sam is trying to infiltrate it. This actually forces Sam to make a lot of the morally black choices they're afraid of in the first place.

When he and Lloyd attempt to save Marble from being beaten in the Iselia Ranch, the plan is for Lloyd to distract them and run through the forest so they follow him, thus preventing the village from being implicated. But, as Lloyd is doing this, Genis <em>trips</em> and makes enough noise that the Desians hear and begin looking for him, so Lloyd is forced to run back and fight them, thus his face is caught on camera. Once the Desians know of his identity, they also discover Lloyd has an exsphere on him and attack the village as punishment for Lloyd violating the treaty, thus getting Lloyd <em>and</em> Genis banned from Iselia. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedClumsiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedClumsiness">All because Genis tripped.</a>

<ul><li> Grif from the Red army fits the trope perfectly. Being a conscript, he is unwilling to work, has terrible stamina, and practically is Red Team's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>. More to the point, he regularly shirks his duty — during one battle, he forgot to bring the spare ammo. In another scenario, he sold all the spare ammo to the Blues. In Grif's own defense, he's intentionally The Millstone; he's trying to get discharged by any means possible, up to and including criminal negligence. In the rare occasion when he's actually trying, he's a lot more useful. Still, you begin to understand after a while why Sarge makes a point of trying to get Grif killed when he makes battle plans.
</li><li> Donut is arguably worse than Grif in this regard, as evidenced by the time Donut and Grif were sent out on a spying mission together. Donut treated it like a game and wound up getting himself captured almost immediately.
</li><li> Caboose is definitely the millstone of the Blue team. He has a tendency to kill his teammates (especially Church, whom he has killed in some fashion at least three times) and is otherwise unable to function in battle (in one scene, he manages to get a grenade stuck to the wall his team is hiding behind). In fact, he is best directed to fight the team's enemies by asking him to <em>help the other side</em>.

If it weren't for Belkar, would Miko have reported an imminent hobgoblin invasion in time to prevent it, or would she still have slain the leader while he was conspiring with the apparent allies of those invaders? If he hadn't pursued Miko to torment her over his childish grudge, would Azure City not have fallen and Soon's Gate remain intact?

While his screwups most of the time only hurt himself, numerous times in team games, his stupidity has cost his team big in too many examples to really list.

Actually <em>got out</em> of the escape helicopter and tried to shoot Michael because he thought he'd get more money (leaving Michael to fly off and leave him to be killed by the opposing teams and also causing his team to lose due to them having more deaths), 2. Was too busy fooling around with the escape boat that he didn't pay attention to where he was going and let the other team win because he <em>drove the boat onto the beach</em>, causing them to lose because the getaway vehicle was now unusable, and 3. the last straw being when he drove the car off of a ramp that took them into an enclosed space where there wasn't any space to drive, allowing the other team to simply roll up and hose them with bullets.

Many of the Eds' failures come from Eddy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">impatience, arrogance, and greed</a> taking the scam far beyond their capabilities.

This is partly averted in that frequently Brain's plans fail of their own accord or due to bad luck, and not through any fault of Pinky's. The Brain is sometimes too stubborn to listen to the plan's legitimate flaw that Pinky points out, which naturally occurs at the climax.
</li><li> Subverted in another episode when Brain builds a device to increase Pinky's intelligence, so that Pinky will no longer impede the success of his plans. Pinky then reviews all of Brain's plans and points out that they were all flawed to begin with. Thus Brain is really <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisOwnWorstEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HisOwnWorstEnemy">his own Millstone</a>.
</li><li> Also played for laughs in one episode where Brain gives up and decides to let Pinky make all the decisions for the next plan. This results in actually going through with several of Pinky's crazy comments (opening up a clam petting zoo, requiring everyone to wear shiny pants) which put them much closer in taking over the world through sheer luck (one of the clams had a valuable pearl, the shiny pants blinded a pilot whose famous passenger thought it was a religious breakthrough and proceeded to give everything to Pinky, etc.). Brain realizes that Pinky had just been incorporating elements of his old schemes, and thinks he can handle it from there. The plan almost immediately goes to hell when Brain takes back the reins.
</li><li> This gets lampshaded in a WB promo where Pinky admits he's actually not that stupid and instead deliberately sabotages Brain's plans, because if they took over the world, the show would be over.

The most prominent example is the whole episode of "Hair Licked" where Rocko wakes up with a bad hair day and Heffer comes over to fix it, only to butcher it even worse than it already was. So Rocko goes to a hair salon and gets a great hair style right before he and Heffer go to Filburt's trailer for Rocko to get his picture. Filburt snaps a lot of great photos of Rocko, but has to start over because he forgot to fill up the camera.

Too bad for Shredder and Krang that it did nothing for their intelligence. As former street thugs, Rocksteady and Bebop are already in way over their heads helping Shredder, but they deliberately avoid learning even the most basic things about Dimension X or Krang's ultimate goal. This causes the two of them to screw up the villains' plans more times than they advance them. They're bad initially, but they become far worse after the show left syndication and came to CBS due to A) there being more restrictive rules about violence on network television and B) a backlash against violence in cartoons in the early 90s. In later seasons, they were so incompetent that several times they manage to screw things up badly enough that Shredder or Krang's latest scheme would get thwarted without the Turtles even getting involved.

The title character is often an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero">Idiot Hero</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessProtagonist">Useless Protagonist</a>, but there are multiple examples of his screw-ups either helping his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HypercompetentSidekick">Hypercompetent Sidekicks</a> save the day, or simply destroying the villains' plans outright.
</li><li> In recent years, Riddler's position in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegionOfDoom">Legion of Doom</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">Superfriends</a></em> has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">described as this</a>. Basically, Riddler's only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatKindOfLamePowerIsHeartAnyway">"power"</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalMindGames">leaving puzzles at crime scenes</a> that the Superfriends inevitably figure out, ruining the Legion's current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan">Evil Plan</a>. In the comic books, this is described as a manifestation of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD">Super OCD</a> and malignant narcissism (he <em>needs</em> to leave riddles to prove that he's smarter than other people—it's how he defines his whole sense of self), but the show never got into the underlying issues, so it seems as though the Riddler's whole purpose is to muck up a perfectly good scheme. It didn't help that he was on a team with no shortage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Geniuses</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">for a certain definition of "genius"</a>), which made an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a> that also has a bizarre need to handicap himself look even less necessary. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> parodied this by showing the Legion voting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">detonate a bomb</a> to take out all of the Superfriends at once—with the exception of Riddler, who eagerly announces that he'll send a few cryptic clues about the plan to give the heroes just enough time to defuse the bomb.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> inevitably drags his friends into the same misery he constantly experiences. One person justifies leaving Bojack by comparing him to a drowning swimmer who won't be saved, and will drag down anyone who tries to help them.
