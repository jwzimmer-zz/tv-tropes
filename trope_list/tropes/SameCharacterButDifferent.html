<ul><li> Android 17 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em> is a straight-laced, pragmatic, no-nonsense character in both personality and fighting style. He's also something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightMan">Straight Man</a> to the sillier characters, with a deadpan sense of humor. This is basically the complete opposite of how he was characterized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, where he was the most carefree and lackadaisical of his trio, screwing around in his fights and annoying his sister with his constant showboating and playing around. He also liked to fight, while his <em>Super</em> incarnation doesn't dislike it, but derives no particular enjoyment from it either, seeing it as a means to an end (e.g. material gain, like that boat he wanted). For that matter, his <em>Super</em> characterization is far more consistent with that of his sister, Android 18, than it is with him. She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemotedToExtra">Demoted to Extra</a> in the same arc where he returns (after a more than twenty year absence in real time, and nearly 15 years in-universe), making it somewhat baffling as to why she couldn't have been used in his role instead.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Superboy-Prime in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a> was introduced during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CrisisOnInfiniteEarths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></em> as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Ascended Fanboy</a> from the real world (or what was closest to it) who became Superboy during the Crisis. He finally went to a better place with the original Superman and Lois. He was brought back much more recently... as an insane <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawFan">Straw Fan</a> villain.
<ul><li> This is also a complaint among some readers with several characters as they're written in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/New52">New 52</a>. In particular, the older members of the JSA who had the most radical changes, such as being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerAndHipper">aged down significantly.</a> Other readers argue that the core of most characters remains the same. There's certainly quite a bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBase">Broken Base</a> for the entire DCU due to this.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Shazam">Billy Batson</a> is another example. Traditionally he begins his superhero career as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">ten-year-old</a> and is the living embodiment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Incorruptible Pure Pureness</a>. The new version is fifteen and is supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a>, but comes off as too much of a jerk for a lot of Billy's old fans to accept.
</li><li> Similar to Billy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">Wally West</a>, when he finally came back. Before the reboot, Wally was Barry Allen's nephew and sidekick, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">Ascended Fanboy</a> who loved the Flash before he gained his powers, a founding member of the Teen Titans, was mostly a decent guy save for being shamelessly flirty and snarky, and for several decades had succeeded Barry as the Flash and had been married with two kids. When he shows up in the new continuity, he's now a 12 year old (even younger than he was when he was Kid Flash) half-black <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> who hates the Flash for putting his uncle in jail, is yet to bond with Barry and doesn't seem to like him much. In old continuity he was Dick Grayson's best friend and the same age as him and Roy Harper, but then he's about a decade younger than them.
</li><li> Finally subverted with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCRebirth">DC Rebirth</a></em>. This character obviously <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy">wasn't accepted by fans</a> and eventually led to DC reintroducing the original version of the Wally in <em>DC Rebirth</em> (down to making him Dick Grayson's best friend again), thus turning him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecompositeCharacter">Decomposite Character</a>. He's now the cousin of the original Wally, who were both independently given their grandfather's name. This has led to the black Wally, who now generally goes by Wallace, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">Rescued from the Scrappy Heap</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> This is extremely common in series with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">Loads and Loads of Characters</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a> in particular, due to their revolving cast there were numerous characters change off panel. Usually they either join some other team, or seek higher education. For example the character Karma. When we're first introduced to her, she is older than the rest of the New Mutants, and considerably more mature, conservative, and acts as a parental surrogate to her brother and sister. She eventually leaves when her siblings are kidnapped. Then cut to several years later when she meets X-Force in a desert rave, with dyed pink hair, body piercings, and revealing clothing. She would also later come out as a lesbian.
<ul><li> Likewise many X-Men would display different or enhanced powers after an absence. Moonstar, for example gained the ability to display past events in the form of illusions. In the X-Treme X-Men series <em>Mekanix</em>, Karma was able to possess up to twenty people at a time, whereas previously she was only able to possess one or two. When Dazzler rejoined the X-Men in the "Eve of Destruction" storyline, she displayed the ability to create hard light images, previously she could only create bursts of light or lasers.
</li><li> ...and then there's the Siege Perilous. Psylocke, Dazzler, Colossus, Rogue, Havok, and Master Mold go in, and in some cases <em>very</em> different people came out the other side: Russian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> farmboy Colossus (temporarily) becomes a popular American artist named Peter Nicholas, and English telepath Psylocke becomes a statuesque Japanese ninja. It also somehow created Bastion, a bizarre <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion Dance</a> of Master Mold and Nimrod, two obviously robotic characters who, when combined, look like a human. While Nimrod was able to holographically disguise itself as a human, for Bastion this is somehow its actual physical form.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> was seemingly killed during a fight with Spider-Man in 1973, leading to his son Harry Osborn taking up the mantle. Norman, revealed to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that let him survive impalement, returned in the 1990's, having orchestrated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga">The Clone Saga</a>, and has since become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> within the Marvel Universe in general. Prior to his "death", Osborn was an absentee father and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a>, but had something of a split personality that wanted to make a name for himself in New York's underworld by dressing in a bizarre costume, but following his return he became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopath</a> with the Goblin persona now seemingly being merged with the original Norman.
<ul><li> This also goes for Harry Osborn, who came back with a very different personality from his previous one after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em> (namely that he's not insane and evil anymore).
</li></ul></li><li> Terra of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a>, when she seemed to be resurrected as Terra II. Terra was originally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Psycho for Hire</a> who infamously died due to her own anger, but the second version was an all-around good guy and a straight superhero. It was later revealed and clarified, however, that the second Terra was actually an alien from an underground society modified into looking like the original, at the cost of her losing her memory of her true identity.
<ul><li> Eventually <em>that</em> explanation was undone to say that she really was Terra, brought back from the dead with her memories and old personality rebooted. Though they went back and on this for a while until the whole thing was rendered moot when Terra II was unceremoniously killed off to make room from a third, completely unrelated Terra as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PowerGirl">Power Girl</a>'s sidekick.
</li></ul></li><li> Compare Black Tarantula's appearances in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> (late <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDarkAgeOfComicBooks">Dark Age</a>) with those in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EdBrubaker">Ed Brubaker</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheModernAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheModernAgeOfComicBooks">Modern Age</a>). You will be surprised how much he changed, without any reason. And, what's the most scary, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">it was good for him</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a></em>: Rocket Raccoon, previously a wise-cracking gunslinging raccoon who was otherwise jovial and friendly, during Bendis' run on the title he's turned into a near-sociopath who enjoys yelling "Blam! Murdered you!" at everyone he kills, declares he isn't a raccoon, and suddenly developed a massive hatred for Earth, despite previously having stated he loves Earth, and our awful TV shows, not to mention his friendship with several humans, including Peter Quill and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">Corsair</a>.
<ul><li> Pretty much applies to all the Guardians of the Galaxy under Bendis. Except the ones who were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus">Put on a Bus</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman2011">Wonder Woman</a></em> cast members who weren't exiled from continuity in the New 52 were entirely unrecognizable, even Wondy was a far cry from her old self, though her own book which at least tried to reconcile the core of the character as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">All-Loving Hero</a> with her new persona. All these changes were undone by the soft reboot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWomanRebirth">Rebirth</a> which declared the characters were fake and Diana's memory had been altered:
<ul><li> Zeus was formerly a misogynistic serial rapist who tried to rape Diana and liked to claim giving her powers and life was his idea (and she should be grateful to him for it and his attempt to rape her) when it was carefully done without his knowledge or consent. Now he's her father, and most of his children are now fond of him and missing him while every single one of his children, even the ones who normally can't stand each other, had allied themselves to usurp him from the throne in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">previous continuity</a>.
</li><li> Athena is a an anthropomorphic owl now? Also she's going out of her way to try to get her father back on the throne when she was the one who led that coalition of his kids in usurping him in the last continuity.
</li><li> Hermes was an upbeat almost perpetually happy fellow who didn't seem to put much stock in the concept of clothes and loved humanity. The new Hermes is a dour distrusting fellow who dresses in layers and despairs of humanity.
</li><li> Ares is now Diana's old mentor and by far the most relatable of the Olympians. He's normally in the running for being her arch-enemy, even when they're theoretically on the same side he used to always find ways to belittle her.
</li><li> Artemis was asexual, reserved and sharp, jumping to action when her Amazons were in danger but otherwise friendly enough, with lithe muscles, sharp cheekbones and a square chin. NuArte is a curvy fight loving nutcase with no regard for collateral damage who revels in the chance to murder an infant and has an incestuous crush on her brother.
</li><li> Dionysus used to be a lackadaisical observer to the chaos his family wrought, often lounging in the background with a smirk and a glass of wine. NuDio Is a sadistic childlike creature with little understanding of human concepts of morality who cuts up and cooks living people and turns people into pigs only to be shocked when it horrifies the woman he's trying to befriend.
</li><li> The Amazons have always been a culture of peace and love, meant to lead by example to the rest of the world by showing them what an idealized human society could be, even if there is some hesitation to trust men again since the last time they did they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderWoman1987">drugged and forced to become sex slaves</a>. The NuAmazons are a misandrist society of serial rapists who murder their own children if they happen to be born male. (This is the change that had the fans up in arms).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SweetValleyHigh">Sweet Valley High</a></em> and its spin-offs did this several times with characters who would be introduced in one series but drastically changed in another. Examples:
<ul><li> Amy Sutton is introduced in <em>Sweet Valley Twins</em> as Elizabeth's best friend who is very similar to her in personality and interests, but is later brought back for <em>Sweet Valley High</em> where, after moving away for a while, she has become a gossipy, fashion-obsessed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> and popular cheerleader who bears almost no resemblance to her former self. A good example of the contrast is a <em>Twins</em> book where Amy fights to be accepted onto the school cheerleading squad, against opposition from the popular Unicorns. By the time of <em>Sweet Valley High</em> however, Amy is a prominent member of the squad and openly bullies girls that she doesn't think are pretty or popular enough to join.
</li><li> Enid Rollins went through this no fewer than three times. In <em>Sweet Valley High</em> she is Elizabeth's studious, strait-laced best friend. By the time of <em>Sweet Valley University</em> she had become a shallow, hard-partying sorority girl who had changed her name to Alexandra, in a makeover very similar to Amy's (there was some mention of Enid/Alex wanting to ditch her unpopular image after high school, but all such character development takes place off the page.) By <em>Sweet Valley Confidential</em>, Enid has reverted to her birth name, is a famous gynecologist (although she WASN'T studying medicine at SVU!) and fanatically right-wing. All three versions of the character bear little resemblance to each other. Enid even has a <em>fourth</em> incarnation off the page where it's mentioned in one of the <em>Sweet Valley High</em> books that before moving to Sweet Valley she was a juvenile delinquent with a drug addiction and a criminal record - all of which would be extremely uncharacteristic for the Enid presented in that series.
</li><li> Winston Egbert is a loveable nerd in most of the books but by <em>Sweet Valley Confidential</em> has become an arrogant, cynical, bullying misogynist after becoming a millionaire in the computer industry. There are a few throwaway lines about how his wealth changed him but none of it is shown to the reader.

</li><li> The Master throughout the classic era went through many changes, from a manipulative gentlemanly villain in Delgado's time, to a walking corpse as the Burned Master, to a flamboyantly evil comic book villain as Anthony Ainley to a more desperate, savage animalisatic character with Eric Roberts portrayal. Nevertheless all of these different incarnations followed the same core personality. All of the Masters in the Classic era were motivated by a desire for power, a hatred of the Doctor, and from the burned Master on; a desire to prolong his own life. (The Delgado Master though not needing to prolong his life, was still written as a coward willing to sacrifice billions to save himself.) They all used the same tactics too of manipulation, hypnosis, placing themselves in positions of authority etc. The John Simm Master however whilst having the same motivations and tactics, was given a totally different, more sympathetic origin story. His relationship with the Doctor was completely retooled too. The Doctor was shown to try and redeem the Simm Master (in the Classic era he had always tried to kill the Master and viewed him as the "quintessence of evil".) Author Russell T Davies also added sexual tension between the Doctor and the Master that was never present before. (Word of god from the characters creators Terrance Dicks and Barry Letts as well as his portrayers, Anthony Ainley and Roger Delgado always stated that the two were warring brothers in the Classic era.) Finally by the time of the female Master, written by Steven Moffat, all aspects of the Master's original character were written out. Missy is outright in love with the Doctor (stating that her hearts are maintained by him.) Has no desire for power or to dominate (she even gives up a near indestructable Cyber army in her first story, stating she doesn't need it; rather handing them over into the Doctor in hopes that he would use them and prove that, as she'd been saying, they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a>.) Her cowardice is not made a major point, nor is her manipulative nature. She also never demonstrates any hypnotic ability. Even in terms of outer personality whilst the Classic era Masters were all more calm and affably evil, Missy is an outright pyschopath. All of these changes made Missy the most controversial incarnation of the character, though there were many who appreciated Michelle Gomez's performance.

Sometimes he'd take flak from the defense for "siding against his race", sometimes he'd object to how a case was being handled, but his "blackness" wasn't his defining trait. He came back in Season 6 as a defense attorney with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalcolmXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MalcolmXerox">Malcolm Xerox</a> leanings, with everyone surprised by the change.

Then, he was greedy and ambitious, though he usually managed to do the right thing in the end. Cut to 20 years later, and a new batch of writers think that the show needs a villain. Well, who better than the soap's original bad boy Paul? Unfortunately, the new writers misremembered how bad Paul had been - his first act upon returning was to burn down the Lassiters hotel complex, murdering a minor character who got in his way. His evil behaviour continued for a while until the writers relented and wrote in a storyline where he had a brain tumour which had affected his personality. It didn't stick however and he was soon back to blackmailing, stealing, sabotaging building sites and generally wrecking lives, although he wasn't quite as bad as when he first came back.

And then came <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/ApolloJusticeAceAttorney">Apollo Justice</a></em>, 7 years later, where Phoenix was now a homeless man who played poker at the basement of a bar and has a 15-year-old adopted daughter. Turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to a large petty grudge, he was set up and tricked into presenting forged evidence that cost him his career. Trucy, his adopted daughter, is the biological daughter of the man that Wright was representing, who lost his life. Turns out the guy that offed him was the same who set up Phoenix, all out of a messed-up sense of pride. Although when you get to play as him, you learn that he's still the same guy on the inside</span>. Then it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">became full circle</a>, after he became the protagonist of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/PhoenixWrightAceAttorneyDualDestinies">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney  Dual Destinies</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HesBack">and back as a lawyer again.</a> For the most part, he kept the mature, mentor personality, but his inner monologues reveal that sometimes he can be as clueless as his rookie partners.
</li><li> Princess Pride from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManBattleNetwork">Mega Man Battle Network</a></em> is an extreme example. When she made her debut in the second game, she was a remorseless terrorist who nearly led several people to their deaths. Come the fifth game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">she joins the heroes</a> in the battle against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Nebula</a> and is by far one of the nicest characters in the team. This may be attributed to her portrayal in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MegaManNTWarrior">the anime adaptation</a>, where she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Girl</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalHeroism">from the start</a>.
</li><li> Cody Travers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFight">Final Fight</a></em> is originally portrayed as a motivated and heroic figure, out to save his girlfriend Jessica from the Mad Gear Gang. Later on Capcom brought him back as part of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterAlpha">Street Fighter Alpha</a> 3</em> but much to the surprise of players, he returned as an escaped convict, complete with prison clothes and handcuffs on his wrists, though his taunt reveals he can take them off at any time if he wished. (Conversely, Guy, Rolento, and Sodom were mostly unchanged from their <em>Final Fight</em> appearances.) Capcom explained that his battle with the Mad Gear Gang had given birth to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">an addiction to fighting</a> and he was thrown in prison for his constant brawling. Later, in <em>Super <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em>, he escapes prison again to look for some excitement (with all evidence suggesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CardboardPrison">he can bust out of jail any time he wants unquestioned</a>) and tells Guy in his ending that prison is where he belongs. Further on, in <em>Final Fight: Streetwise</em>, he falls even further due to a bum knee and juicing on a radical drug in order to stay competitive, though he tries to coach his brother due to the potential Cody sees in Kyle, was said to have deliberately taken the fall for a different crime <em>Guy</em> had committed (Guy also on the receiving end of this trope in <em>Streetwise</em> to a lesser extent), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later regains the full use of his legs thanks to said drug</span>.
<ul><li> It should be noted, however, that Guy feels, deep down, Cody remains a hero and is willing to fight him to make a point of it and convince Cody to join him in the battle against injustice (hence their Rival Battles in <em>Alpha 3</em> and <em>SSFIV</em>). Cody himself says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicHeroSyndrome">he can't idly sit by</a> while evil—like Bison and Seth—is at large (again affirmed by his <em>Street Fighter</em> appearances, particularly his <em>Alpha 3</em> ending), and depending on the continuity, Cody may have even been falsely accused and jailed for <em>Poison's</em> crimes. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterV">Street Fighter V</a></em> shows Guy's faith in Cody isn't unwarranted, as Cody cleans up his act, gets exonerated of his crimes by Haggar, and goes on to become Metro City's next mayor—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImNotAHeroIm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImNotAHeroIm">though Cody insists he's not hero material</a>.

His moveset is also different, replete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> teleports and the ability to call upon a dark green energy of sorts. The story mode explains that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he was revived by Illuminati agents and is given a task to kill Bison and stop the Shadaloo group, and he's told that while he's given enhanced powers, his revival won't last long, so he's pretty dead-set on his mission. The <em>Alpha 2</em> ending of him getting betrayed by his own Air Force members (who are implied to be Shadaloo's mole troops) and got thrown out of his aircraft also makes him bitter and untrusting.</span>

In each episode, the characters look and act noticeably different and more mature.

</li><li> Isaac and Garrett, heroes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> and <em>Golden Sun: The Lost Age</em> are completely different in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em>, which takes place 20 years later. Isaac was originally portrayed as a bit reckless, but had a clear goal in mind and knew what to do while Garrett was the hot headed idiot. Cut ahead 20 years later, Isaac has become totally aloof, cryptic, and has no problem of sending his son, Matthew, and his friend, Faris, on a dangerous quest to save Garrett's son, Tyrell and then tasking all three kids with finding a way to repairing the Soar Wing. Garrett calls Isaac out for being completely irresponsible by letting the kids go out on their own on such a dangerous journey while Isaac says it will do them good since they would learn from experience like he had done when he first started on his quest years prior. In short, Isaac goes from leader to vague and irresponsible while Garrett changes from irresponsible to responsible and sensible.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Jill Valentine</a> manages to do this in a non-storyline way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom3">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a></em>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcom2">Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</a></em> she was still wearing her S.T.A.R.S. uniform and was able to do things like a flaming dash and summon zombies, birds, and a Tyrant for her Hyper Combo. Come <em>MvC3</em>, where she came in as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a>, she was modeled after her appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em>, where she was under Wesker's control. As a result she fought like an acrobatic assassin, using things like sommersault kicks and attacking with her Skorpion submachine gun. The two <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> iterations of Jill are completely different from each other with zero overlap, essentially making them two distinct characters in the same series of games.
<ul><li> Though less dramatically, Frank West in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TatsunokoVsCapcom">Tatsunoko vs. Capcom</a>: Ultimate All-Stars</em> and <em>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</em> are not the same character.

However, he retained his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">game-breaking</a> normal attacks even as a playable character. He had 6 Hyper Combos, representing his usage of each of the 6 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInfinityGauntlet">Infinity Gems</a>. He was toned down considerably in <em>MvC2</em>, where his normals weren't given such high priority and he only had access to 4 Hyper Combos, missing the ones where he uses the Time and Mind Gems. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBusCameBack">Making his return to the series</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelVsCapcomInfinite">Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</a></em>, Thanos's moveset was given quite an overhaul.

</li><li> Noob Saibot of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> franchise went through a curious change after his first appearance in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat2">II</a></em>. In that game, he was a pure black palette swap of Scorpion, replete with his spear special move. Come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat3">the third game</a>, despite the game having ninjas in the form of Sub-Zero and the cyborg trio of Sektor, Cyrax and Smoke, Noob was made into a pure black palette swap of <em>Kano</em>, and with no special moves. When Scorpion and Reptile were re-introduced in the <em>Ultimate</em> update of <em>3</em>, Noob was altered into his traditional pure black ninja form, and the later <em>Trilogy</em> version made him the shadow attack-based character we know today.

Also, flashes of his original personality emerge from time to time, particularly through his "Deepthroat" storyline and towards the end. A similar change happens to Raiden, who goes from being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisLoserIsYou">This Loser Is You</a> gamer caricature who is still quite bright and hopeful, into a deeply depressed ninja who inherits Frank's Death Seeker personality and fixation on Snake - a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheScrappyHeap">move to boost Raiden's popularity</a> that went over quite well. Like with Frank, Snake in particular is shown to be horrified by what has happened to his friend, and tries to talk him back to his older personality.
</li><li> Vamp keeps a similar aesthetic and powers between his appearances, but in <em>4</em> he has a markedly different personality, going from being brooding and somewhat sympathetic, to being a horrifically violent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathSeeker">Death Seeker</a> with no explanation. All the water-themed and magic-themed powers he had in his first appearance (the ones <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompositeCharacter">inherited from Chinaman</a>) are dropped.
</li></ul></li><li> The Nameless Hero in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gothic">Gothic</a></em> franchise. In the trilogy created by Piranha Bytes, he's known as a roguish hero with a snarky sense of humor and not really caring about authority. However, "Forsaken Gods" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOntheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOntheWriter">made by a completely different studio</a> changed his character completely. He became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">overly patriotic, authoritarian and absolutely loves giving pompous speeches</a>.

In <em>Awakening</em>, he is a rather carefree apostate on the run from the Circle who is a pretty big womanizer. In <em>II</em>, while still an apostate mage, he is now rather moody and serious, as well as being gay (if Hawke is a man, bisexual if Hawke is a woman) without showing any interest in any women (besides a female Hawke). This can at least partially be chalked up to the fact that he fused with Justice, a spirit from the Fade stuck in the physical world, which undoubtedly altered his personality (and continues to do so as the story progresses), but even with that he barely resembles the character he was in his first appearance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption2">Red Dead Redemption II</a></em>: The personalities of most existing gang members from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">I</a></em> have been changed, some more than others. Only Jack Marston and Dutch van der Linde are more or less exactly like described in <em>I</em>.
<ul><li> The first game and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllInTheManual">All in the Manual</a> material paint John Marston as being the only rational one in the gang, disliked by both Javier Escuella and Bill Williamson, and who noticed Dutch's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> declining mental state first</span>. Not only is John more or less liked by almost everyone, John's rationality was given to Arthur Morgan.
</li><li> Javier is described as a creep disliked by Abigail Roberts who "had a lot of passion, but no love" for the outlaw lifestyle, and who was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFriend">False Friend</a> to John. Here he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DashingHispanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DashingHispanic">Dashing Hispanic</a> who is buddies with John, and whose main flaw is his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> to Dutch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Even as the gang starts falling apart, Javier doesn't go "insane" like John described in <em>I</em>, he just <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALeveInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALeveInJerkass">becomes a total Jerkass</a></span>.
</li><li> Bill is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFriendNobodyLikes">The Friend Nobody Likes</a> instead of the crazy and greedy maniac described in <em>I</em>; however, this change is explained <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> by his mental issues. He was also described as having a "fatherly" relationship with Dutch and a "brotherly" relationship with John and was jealous that Abigail picked John over him. Sound familiar? His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> traits also contradicts the claim that he loved and slept with Abigail, as well as his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapePillageAndBurn">Rape, Pillage, and Burn</a></span> aspects from <em>I</em>.
</li><li> In general, it seems like Bill and Javier's negative traits that were implied in <em>I</em> were given to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate">Micah Bell</a>, likely to make those two more sympathetic.
</li><li> Abigail is repeatedly said to have been the gang bicycle, which is not shown here. However, this is also somewhat justified as she is implied to have been a prostitute before Jack was born. Still, the way things happen in <em>II</em> would be unlikely to leave the impression that Abigail was "passed around" and was "any man's wife".
</li><li> Even Uncle seems different. He's a meek and grumpy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> in <em>I</em>, but a very cheerful and goofy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guy</a> in <em>II</em>.

Really, the only similarities he has with his characterization in the first game is that he's an old drunkard that dislikes working. There's also no indication in <em>I</em> that he was apart of the Van der Linde gang.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Eddsworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/Eddsworld">Eddsworld</a></em> originally featured four main characters based on the real life creators of the show. Edd, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomSka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomSka">Tom</a>, Matt and Tord. Since the latter didn't exactly get along with Tom, he eventually decided to leave the team, his character was also removed from the cast. In <em>Eddsworld Legacy</em>, made as a tribute to Edd Gould after his death, Tord is brought back in the final episode, but this time as an antagonist, revealing that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">friendship was a lie</a>. This idea was quite controversial as Tord is based on a real person and this vilification of his character was deemed insensitive for some.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> has this as a source of for why every installment is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContestedSequel">Contested Sequel</a>, with most characters deemed by fans to have undergone personality shifts both major and minor between showrunners — those being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ManOfActionStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ManOfActionStudios">Man of Action Studios</a> and Alex Soto for the original, Dwayne McDuffie and Glen Murakami for <em>Alien Force</em> and <em>Ultimate</em>, Derrick J. Wyatt and Matt Youngberg for <em>Omniverse</em>, and Man of Action and John Fang for the 2016 reboot. How many of these personality changes made sense in the original continuity, and thus actually qualify for this trope, is YMMV, but the following are unanimously agreed upon:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterClown">Zombozo</a> was a horrifying emotion vampire who was also a great showman. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></em>, he's just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> with a couple of magician-based superpowers.
</li><li> Kevin in the original series was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">Enfant Terrible</a> with extra terrible, being <em>frighteningly</em> murderous. In some ways he was more evil than even some season <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a>: A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a> type will kill you because you're in the way; Kevin will kill you just because he <em>can.</em> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Ben 10: Alien Force</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></em>, he's reintroduced as a criminal of the more "out to make a dishonest buck" type and quickly makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> after falling in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveAtFirstSight">Love at First Sight</a> (well, first sight in the new series) with Gwen. His powers have gone from energy absorption to the ability to transform into any material he touches. When his past was discussed, it was softened considerably - apparently, viewers were supposed to believe he'd <em>always</em> been the mostly harmless ne'er-do-well he'd been in the first ten minutes of <em>Alien Force.</em> It should tell you something when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDreaded">The Dreaded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> <em>Vilgax,</em> once described as "Darth Vader without the sense of humor," turned out to actually care about his people and have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentAdorationRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentAdorationRating">100% Adoration Rating</a> back home and it wasn't considered to be nearly the same level of derailment as Kevin's change. Some of his behavior can be attributed to the five-year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a>, but certain changes like his lack of sociopathy and rather abrupt <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> struck a sizable chunk of the fanbase as ham-fisted. It took until <em>Ultimate Alien</em> before any explanation was given for how Kevin became sane - it was still being demanded at that point because even after <em>years</em> of this new characterization, Saint Kevin was just too big a horse pill for fans to swallow.
</li><li> It's to the point that Ben and Gwen giving Kevin a chance needed <em>every</em> bit as much explaining away because it's just that unthinkable after what he'd been like. After a time travel episode that Original Series Ben wasn't supposed to remember once he'd returned to the past, Professor Paradox explained that he'd remember it very faintly, maybe just enough to consider the idea of Kevin becoming good when meeting him again. <em>Omniverse</em> took it farther, establishing that the gang had met the criminal-but-not-psychotic version of Kevin between the original series and AF/UA. Yes, it actually took years to make the new Kevin make sense, and <em>more</em> years to make Ben and Gwen <em>entertaining the idea that Kevin could be in their midst and not kill them for fun</em> make sense! That's how you know you've fallen into this trope big-time. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note525i0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note525i0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note525i0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(For the record, if you care, the reason given for his change was that his powers can absorb matter <em>or</em> energy, but storing energy drives him insane. He learned to rid himself of that energy between series, and has stuck to a matter-only diet since then.)</span>
</li><li> The character of Charmcaster is a particularly egregious case of this trope in action. In the original series, she was a play on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl">Dark Magical Girl</a> trope, more willfully malevolent than most but not wholly devoid of better qualities either. Come <em>Alien Force</em>, she has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">become purely villainous</a> and increasingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">murderous</a>. In <em>Ultimate Alien</em>, she suddenly becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">darkly tragic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> who starts going through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">HeelFace Revolving Door</a>. Then in <em>Omniverse</em>, an emotional breakdown has made her become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">childish</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaughablyEvil">Laughably Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Cloud Cuckoolander</a>, although toward the end she circles back toward being more like she was in the original series.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben102016">Ben 10 (2016)</a></em> has Frightwig of the Circus Freak Trio. While Thumbskull and Acid Breath look pretty much the same as they were in previous shows, Frightwig is now a preteen girl that acts as an independent villain, while being a dark mirror to Ben's more egotistical side.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em>
<ul><li> Ezekiel was introduced as a home schooled lower who was always destined to be eliminated first and forgotten. Come <em>World Tour</em>, he stowes away on the plane and becomes malnourished and feral, pretty much turning into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings">Gollum</a>, where he'd spend the rest of his time terrorizing the cast with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringExtra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecurringExtra">Where's Waldo</a> style cameos.
</li><li> This was kind of done with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttractiveness">Justin</a>. In the first season proper, he was very <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfFocus">Out of Focus</a>—he only spoke in the first episode and got voted off around episode five. In the first season special, however, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlySpeaking">talks a lot more</a> and is presented as a rather crafty antagonist. Season two continued with this characterization and set him up as the new villain, only to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">forget about that arc</a> and replace him with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassSue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassSue">Courtney</a>, who is a straight-up case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDerailment">Character Derailment</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Hyperion studio's <em>Itsy Bitsy Spider</em> (spun off from the short subject that played in theaters with the feature <em>Bebe's Kids</em>) series had a little <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">Meganekko</a> girl named Leslie as Itsy's friend. Leslie went from being sweet and introverted in the first season to kind of bitchy in the second.
</li><li> One of the big draws of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> was its heightened focus on character development as opposed to G1. So when its direct sequel series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastMachines">Beast Machines</a></em>, brought certain characters back into the fold, well... the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">usual complaints</a> when a new TF property comes out seemed justified for once. Without naming names - for fear of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallsOfText">Walls of Text</a>, 'cause it applies to pretty much <em>everyone</em> - many characters were themselves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InNameOnly">In Name Only</a>. Worst, certain characters who were altruistic to a <em>fault</em> in <em>Beast Wars</em> spontaneously became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">not so nice</a>, if not outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">Xergiok the Goblin King</a> was introduced as a tyrant whom <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidHero">Finn</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonHumanSidekick">Jake</a> had to defeat. He reappears seasons later having been magically blinded, peacefully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">caring for a flock of giant birds</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He goes through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelRevolvingDoor">FaceHeel Revolving Door</a>, temporarily turning evil again</span>.
</li><li> Goofy and Pete had sons in various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Classic Disney Shorts</a> (some of the fatherhood-related <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryman">The Everyman</a> sketches for the former, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck">Donald Duck</a> cartoon "Bellboy Donald" for the latter). They had sons decades later in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em> series (and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanonImmigrant">few other sources</a> in Goofy's case). Within this time:
<ul><li> Goofy Jr. gained ears, turned from a redhead with a pink nose to being colored the same way as his dad, became much more serious and also more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoundedCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoundedCharacter">Rounded Character</a> (since Goofy Jr. was mainly a plot device), and got a name change to Max. There was a brief transition period in the comics, though.
</li><li> Pete Jr. got smaller ears, got fatter, had his voice pitched up roughly two or three octaves (despite being <em>older</em>), and made a 180 degree personality change from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfantTerrible">bratty, conniving, and sadistic</a> to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">sweet and unassuming</a> textbook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Woobie">Woobie</a>. Oh, and he started going by "PJ" instead of "Junior."
</li></ul></li><li> The 2015 revival of the 2008 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeOfTheJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GeorgeOfTheJungle">George of the Jungle</a></em> series has had several changes made to the characters. George is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopHeavyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopHeavyGuy">Top-Heavy Guy</a> like 60s George, Ape has a British accent like 60s Ape, Magnolia and Ursula's names have been switched, Ursula (previously named Magnolia) is a feral wild woman, the scientist and the witch doctor are no longer the girls' dads, and the scientist is now a villain.
</li><li> Kiara as a cub hated the idea of becoming queen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionKingIISimbasPride">The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</a></em> but in the midquel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionGuard">The Lion Guard</a></em> she's pleased with the idea and lords it over Kion. She was also shown to be a very poor hunter even as an adult in <em>Simba's Pride</em>, to the point where Kovu had to teach her how, but in <em>The Lion Guard</em> she seems to be a pro even as a cub.
</li><li> Bubbles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> was a sensitive, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllLivingThings">Friend to All Living Things</a> and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">The Heart</a> of the trio. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">The Powerpuff Girls (2016)</a></em> her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander">cloudcuckoolander</a> traits are exaggerated even compared to her post-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderization</a> characterization in the previous series. She's not portrayed nearly as sensitive as before and has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl">excitable</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunPersonified">personality</a>. Her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">darker side</a> is more obvious as well.
</li><li> Downplayed in Season 23 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em>, where Randy was still recognizably the same character, being a selfish, idiotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">Manchild</a> with a tendency to treat the most minor of things as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>, but has lost any of his positive traits and become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Greed">greedy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> who only cares about making a profit, kills numerous people, and engages in unethical and underhanded business tactics, coming across more like an adult Cartman than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">Bumbling Dad</a> of previous seasons.
