You can see the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourPrincessIsInAnotherCastle">Your Princess Is in Another Castle!</a> moment coming when you've got half your equipment missing, but you still won't know exactly when or why it happens.
</p><p>This is common in the tutorial and early sections, where the game is still gradually introducing new mechanics, and the player shouldn't be messing with them beforehand.

</p><p>Many "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">Achievement</a>" lists will give things away about the game to come; for example, the names of certain bosses, levels, etc. However, others may avert this by leaving any story-related achievements hidden until they're achieved or only giving them vague descriptions like "Defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>."

The thing is that you can scroll through all of the possible items and weapons right from the start, revealing whom you might be fighting later.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> series typically has inventory screens with each slot reserved for a specific item, and by the end of the game the player will have acquired most of them.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>:
<ul><li> Such a big inventory screen, with such huge spaces for items and equipment, should tell you that even after you get all three Pendants and the Master Sword, there's still a ton of game left.
</li><li> And if that didn't clue you in, the sheer scope of the map should do the same. Especially the Dark World map, which you can first sneak a peek at when you take the portal on Death Mountain. There's no way all of that landscape is going unused...

The exception is the Triforce's outline, as the Triforce itself is unobtainable.
</li><li> This trend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegendOfZelda">drove fans nuts</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">Oracle of Ages and Seasons</a></em>. With every item found, there were still two empty item slots. It was actually because equipping an item <strong>moves it</strong> from your inventory to the equip slot, so these two empty spaces were for whatever two items you had equipped.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0akxe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0akxe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0akxe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This, by the way, was done to prevent a bug in the engine from showing up, and because there were items in the games that allowed you to use the empty item slot.</span>

<ul><li> Every single NPC in the game is named in their dialogue window, except for disguised Yiga Clan enemies, who are always just "Traveler." This doesn't really help you, though, because this tell doesn't become apparent until after you talk to the character, at which point it's too late to avoid the attack if they're a Yiga.
</li><li> Once you get the Camera rune, you can tell beforehand which Decayed Guardians are just background scenery and which will try to shoot you by pointing the camera at it. The ones that will attack are labeled. As well as this, the upgraded Stasis rune will also highlight Decayed Guardians from a distance when used, as they're just as susceptible to being frozen by it as any other enemy.
</li><li> The Stasis rune can be used to detect which flower is just a generic flower versus a collectible material.

Brawl</a></em>. The 120 individual challenges censor the names of potential spoilers until you've reached that point. (e.g. Defeat ??? using the ???) And then it goes one further: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It only features challenges related to the first 9 chapters, supposedly the entirety of the game <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note09on0');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note09on0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note09on0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">With one exception: the challenge to find the Leo Zodiac Chamber, which is in Chapter 10, is on the Palutena page, meaning someone who thoroughly explored chapter 9 and realized it wasn't there could figure out that the game wasn't almost over.</span>, so it will seem to be near completion by the time you reach the "final boss". There's actually a second batch of challenges called Viridi's Treasure Hunt, which doesn't even appear until you meet her in the story. There's also a third set that won't appear until you've beaten the game, but there are no spoilers to hide at that point.</span>
</li><li> You can tell the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> just from the fact that you don't have all the brush techniques yet, but if that didn't tip you off, the fact that your equipment screen looks so empty is likely to. For reference, there are three types of weapon available: reflectors, rosaries, and glaives. Completing said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a> nets you your first glaive... out of five.

</li><li> The game's Scan Data also calls a certain boss "Dark Samus 1", indicating further encounters. It also plays with this trope a bit, since the scans have changed a bit. Enemies in the same group will share a group percent, which shows how many scans there are in the group. Scanning Dark Samus 1 gives you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">25%</span> of the Dark Samus scans, which suggests that you fight Dark Samus <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">4</span> times, except that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you only fight Dark Samus three times; "Dark Samus 3" and "Dark Samus 4" come from the same battle, with the later scan being a certain special attack</span>.

<ul><li> Most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> achievements don't bother with obscuring spoiler objectives. One exception is the achievement for the Trial of the Crusader raid, which hides the name of the final boss, only showing it as "Complete the Trial of the Crusader". The final boss is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anub'arak, after the Lich King breaks the floor of the Coliseum and makes you fall into the Nerubian tunnels below it</span>. Later, even this was spoiled by the raid-lock system, which names the bosses that have and have not been defeated this week. By then, though, raid leaders generally insisted on either giving all first-timers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Walkthrough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Walkthrough">Walkthrough</a> or having them watch one on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a>, making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler">Late-Arrival Spoiler</a> inevitable anyway.
<ul><li> When you start a new worgen character in Gilneas, you can immediately zoom out the world map to the Eastern Kingdoms and notice that the hover text for the Gilneas zone says "Ruins of Gilneas" instead. This points to two things: one, that your homeland isn't going to survive intact very long; and two, for the more tech-savvy players, it shows that the version of Gilneas you start in is actually an instance isolated from the main world. Even worse, when inspecting the Ruins of Gilneas map, you can immediately notice that a significant chunk of land in the southwest is missing, foreshadowing that it will be sunk by the Cataclysm during the worgen intro storyline.
</li><li> Since Cataclysm all players now have access to a dungeon journal which gives a name, portrait, short section of biography text, ability list and some tactical information for every boss in a new dungeon or raid as soon as it is released. The betrayal of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Archbishop Benedictus</span> in the Hour of Twilight dungeon is not exactly hard to predict when you already have a screen full of information up to and including a list of all the spells that he is going to zap you with.
</li><li> Quests used to be bad about this because they followed a very rigid format. If the quest text told you to kill an NPC, but the quest objective said "confronted 0/1" instead of "killed 0/1", you knew they would get away. Quests might tell you find someone missing but the objective would tell you it was a corpse you would find. One quest of Sven's Revenge gave you clues to a person's identity, but that person showed up on the map as a quest completed icon. Since <em>Legion</em>, this has improved, with a more flexible format: new objectives can come up that were not visible before, so you may find an NPC, only for them to become hostile, and the quest changes to "kill NPC".
</li><li> In "Dagger in the Dark", which, like other scenarios, has a series of objectives you need to complete, displays the final objective- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">killing the Kor'kron assassins</span> even <em>before</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rak'gor Bloodrazor tries to kill Vol'jin</span>.
</li><li> In <em>Legion</em>, the "Followers" tab on your scouting map shows all of the Champions you can recruit for your Order Hall, not just the ones you already have. This makes it practically impossible to be surprised by who you recruit, even though some of these characters were very obviously intended to be twists.
</li><li> Sometimes even the exploration achievements can spoil. In Highmountain, one of the areas players have to find is called "Feltotem". Given that one of the tribes in Highmountain are the Bloodtotem, no one is surprised when they join the Burning Legion.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em>, every zone of the last few expansions has a "Hunter" achievement which basically lists every "named" or boss mob in the zone. Is "Lord Bob" a quest person, normal trash mob or named (special loot dropping) monster? If he's on the "Hunter" list, you have the answer.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>, most quest-specific equipment can't be traded or purchased on the Grand Exchange specifically to prevent this happening, or the players cheating their way through the quests by buying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">Mac Guffins</a>. However, you can still find Barrows equipment on the Exchange for the quest-specific Barrows wights <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Akrisae</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Linza</span>, and get spoiled that those characters will die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>:
<ul><li> A major player in one of the side quest chains (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">specifically, Fray of the Dark Knight job quests</span>) is eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reveal">Revealed</a> to be your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyWithout">Enemy Without</a>. Accordingly, this character's gender is "coincidentally" the same as yours — even if you use a Fantasia potion to change genders mid-questline, or go through it on a different-gender alt. Luckily, this <em>probably</em> won't happen by accident, since Fantasias <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">cost real money</a> and the game's mechanics discourage <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Altitis">Alt-itis</a>. But it's still <em>possible</em>.
</li><li> In the <em>A Realm Reborn</em> chapters of the game, you can't progress any further beyond patch 2.4 content until you defeated the hard mode versions of Ifrit, Titan, and Garuda. Now why would you be forced to tackle content that has almost no bearing on the main story? This is due to the NPC that gives the quest vanishes by the time you gain the ability to enter Ishgard (the start of the 3.0 <em>Heavensward</em> content). Since the primals you have to fight again are also linked to the relic quest lines, losing out on the whole thing due to the quest giver vanishing would screw the player over. Ergo, you have to do the side content anyway so that you are not screwing yourself over by making other content gone forever. This later gets subverted, however, in patch 4.4: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A Realm Reborn's extreme trials aren't required for the main quest, and Urianger will still be in the Waking Sands to hand them out even after his soul gets transported to a parallel dimension.</span>
</li><li> At the end of the main story in 4.3's "Under the Moonlight", some cut scenes play out with one of them showing the supporting protagonist inside a ship that gets shot down while the other shows the player character having a conversation with the other characters. After the cut scene with the ship crash, the screen fades to black and then you get a pop up text telling you to get ready for an instanced battle. This caught many players off guard since the duty pop up always occur when something is going on with their character. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that the battle involves Alphinaud and you get to control him as an actual playable character.</span>
</li><li> In patch 4.2's "Rise of a New Sun" story, it reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Zenos</span> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a>. His text box gives away a very subtle hint that something is not quite right where the game only shows his first name rather than his entire name. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">4.3 reveals that Zenos's body was taken over by an Ascian while Zenos himself took over someone else's body.</span>
</li><li> The menu that displays all of your job's abilities will show you everything you will learn as you level up and complete job quests, ruining the surprise of what new skills you will obtain. The skills learned in <em>Heavensward</em> were hidden until you actually learned them, but by the next expansion, it was changed to be displayed with everything else. Quest rewards (which can also include job skills) will also reveal what you can earn upon completion of the quest. Certain quests avoid the trope by having the item icon as a gift box with only "???" appearing if you try to see what the item is.
</li><li> Shadowbringers takes great strides to hide various parts of its map. For one, the map of Norvrandt can't be viewed at all until the player first makes their way there, and even after arriving there the sixth zone, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Tempest</span>, has every point of interest replaced by question marks, including the zone's aetheryte. Furthermore, most references to the sixth zone elsewhere (such as achievements, where to acquire the orchestrion roll for that zone, hunt locations, and so on) are similarly obscured. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The latter half of the zone, Amaurot, goes even further - its points of interest and aetheryte <em>don't even appear on the map at all</em> until you get there for the first time.</span>
</li><li> This trope is played straight, however, with the final dungeon of Shadowbringers' Main Quest, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amaurot</span>; the dungeon drops the orchestrion roll for the song that plays within, and thus the dungeon is listed by name in the orchestrion log.
</li><li> In most instanced content with a party, the moment the last remaining player is knocked out, the screen immediately fades to black and the fight resets. In the fight against Ultimate Bahamut, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his Terraflare attack will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyWipe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyWipe">kill everyone</a>, even if you use the tank's strongest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>. The screen doesn't fade and you're informed that Phoenix's cry cuts through your desperation. Phoenix itself appears and revives the whole party and fills up the Limit Break gauge to the full three bars.</span>
</li><li> In 3.5, completing the MSQ to that point earned you the title "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Palpaymo's</span> Final Witness". The title completely spoiled the death of the named character and it was impossible to avoid since many players used that title in their displayed title preference. The developers admitted that the title name was a mistake on their part and the next patch changed it to avoid spoilers.
</li><li> The MSQ in 5.3 discusses the character <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Azim</span>, who had played a major role in the distant past and they were friends with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Emet-Selch</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Azim's gender matches the player character's and it changes if you change your character's gender, signifying that Azim was the player character in their past life.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>, players are free to enter any map regardless of their story progress, so this can happen a lot from talking to scouts, reading the descriptions of renown hearts or events, or simply listening to NPC chatter. So, for example, in the core game, every level 60 or so area reveals that the three Orders of Tyria eventually join to become the Pact; in the Heart of Thorns expansion, you can explore Tarir before meeting the Exalted or head to Rata Novus before ever hearing its name; and in the recent Path of Fire expansion, exploring the Elon Riverlands spoils that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vlast, Aurene's brother and Glint's first son, dies</span>. There's one particular instance that tries to avoid this: in Bloodtide Coast, a Risen Commander spawns <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and taunts you over the death of your Order mentor</span> only if you've completed the Battle for Claw Island on that character. However, it's still possible to see <em>another</em> player trigger their appearance, and the event's name spells out that it's a fight to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">avenge your mentor's death</span>. Achievement names and descriptions are a mixed bag - some are as vague as possible, or even outright hidden until you complete them - though again, one attempt to hide a spoiler in a Living World episode still ironically ends up doing the opposite. To wit, it is described only as "Follow your foe's tracks deeper into the volcano", but the associated story step is named <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Pursuit of a God</span>, revealing just who was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">impersonating Lazarus the Dire</span>.

Starting with <em>Jak 3</em>, once the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Heart Containers</a> is established you can calculate how many more you're likely to get based on how much of the circle it covers.

</li><li> A particularly egregious example from <em>Up Your Arsenal</em>: It's pretty obvious a certain character isn't really dead when you know you'll later visit a place called <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Qwark's Hideout.</span> Another possible one from that game is "Crash Site," even if <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">exactly <em>what</em> crashed may not be immediately obvious.</span>
</li><li> There's also arena challenges such as "Defeat all enemies using only the Rift Inducer", which appear long before said weapons are available.
</li><li> In the Aquatos Sewers, there are icons for Gadgetron vendors floating out in the middle of nowhere, making it clear that there's more of the sewers to explore than you can see. Well, at least until you get the Map-O-Matic.
</li><li> The Monsterpedia in <em>Going Commando</em> lists the home planet of each enemy; when it's not the world you first encounter them on, you know you'll probably be visiting it later on. Examples include all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">Thugs-4-Less</a> members being from Snivelak <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which you go to when you storm their base to rescue someone very late in the game</span>, and all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> robots listing Yeedil, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's the location of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a>'s headquarters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>.</span> Subverted with some though, such as the B2-Brawler's home planet Cerebella, which has yet to make an appearance in the series.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetDeadlocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetDeadlocked">Ratchet: Deadlocked</a></em>, the stats menu gives you information about what you've done in the game.

<ul><li> Throughout the franchise, the menu screens almost always have exactly enough room for every weapon and item in the game. When you get one Sub-Tank, for instance, you can see where the Sub-Tanks appear on the menu, how much more room there is, and therefore how many more Sub-Tanks are in the game (generally a total of four).

</li><li> Similarly, even non-spoiler labeled Miiverse messages could serve as this thanks to the stamps. Not only can people use them freely without spoiler warnings, but you can see the outlines of the stamps, and a lot of them are really easy to make out.

However, pressing 'e' to open the "eat" menu can potentially tell you the equipment's material: if the equipment shows up in the list of food, its material is Raw.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NuclearThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NuclearThrone">Nuclear Throne</a></em> has a few Steam achievements, namely "Throne Sitter", "Advanced Sitter" and "The Struggle Continues", which show that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the titular Throne is actually a hostile boss</span>. Oddly enough, the first of these achievements is redundant because the "Rogue Unlocked" achievement is earned in the same manner and has a more vague description.

If you right-click her, she says the same phrase as the original, giving a hint about their origins.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BaldursGateIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BaldursGateIII">Baldur's Gate III</a></em> the cleric Shadowheart is initially quite cagey about which of the many gods she worships and will only open up to you after you spend enough time with her... or you can open her status screen and scroll down to the "tags" subheading.
<ul><li> Early on in Baldur's Gate 3, you meet a sweet old lady selling potions and herbs at the local refugee camp. While she's very knowledgeable, she seems like nothing more than a sweet old potion-brewer. Except for the fact that she's a level 5 npc with 112 hp in a game where, currently, level 4 is the cap and only bosses have even close to that amount of hp. To make it even more obvious, if you examine her she is listed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">Fey</a> as opposed to a Human.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Game Boy Color, Super Famicom, and mobile phone versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em>, defeating Baramos <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">yields 65536 experience points for the party, indicating that he is not the final boss</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a> that does <em>very</em> convincing impression of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>...if not for the fact that half of the world map isn't accessible yet.
</li><li> The existence of secret playable classes may start to become obvious in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIX">Dragon Quest IX</a></em> when weapon types no member of your party can equip start appearing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestXI">Dragon Quest XI</a></em> has a couple. There being multiple different weapon categories spoils that you don't have everyone yet when you have the seven characters featured in the intro movie and nobody has the ability to use Axes (nor have you found any yet). The other one is within the Bestiary, as sorting it alphabetically before the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">Disc-One Final Dungeon</a> shows that there are pages and pages of ????? between "Very Devil" and "Vince", an alarmingly small portion of the alphabet for so many enemies (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they're "Vicious" enemies</span>).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyI">Final Fantasy I</a></em> has this by the nature of its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">Vancian Magic</a> system. The player can pretty much immediately see that there are eight levels of magic, even when they only have access to the first-level spells at the beginning of the game. It also spoils that there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrestigeClass">Prestige Classes</a> by the fact that even the dedicated white/black mages cannot learn the highest levels of magic in their non-prestige form.
</li><li> In the GBA remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyII">Final Fantasy II</a></em>, major non-party NPCs have portraits...and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Dark Knight</span>'s portrait is obviously <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Leon's portrait, darkened</span>. The PSP remake improves this somewhat: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Dark Knight wears a helmet, but the rest of his armor and his stare are still identical to Leon's</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em>:
<ul><li> While only in the DS version at least, when you unlock the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundTest">Music box</a> from Jammingway, some of the song titles actually reveal characters and texts that you won't meet until later in the game. There is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltText" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltText">additional descriptions courtesy of Edward.</a> Some of his descriptions actually outright state where they actually play. For example. <em>Red Wings - Short Version,</em> while it plays for the fight against the Dark Knight, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Edward mentions that it plays in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">the final dungeon</a>.</span>
</li><li> Not so much an Interface Spoiler as Interface Foreshadowing, but Tellah is seeking out the spell <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastDiscMagic">Meteor</a> for purposes of revenge. He finally gets it, and supposedly even has access to it in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a>, but a quick check of the menu reveals that he does not and will never have enough magic power to actually cast it, thus explaining why, when he eventually does cast it later on, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">at the cost of his own life</a>.
</li><li> Another comes when Baigan joins the party. That brings the party total to six, which is more than can even physically fit in the menu screen, so it's no surprise when he turns out to be lying. This is even more obvious in later versions of the game: in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GameBoyAdvance">Game Boy Advance</a> version, every playable character has their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterPortrait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterPortrait">Character Portrait</a> appear onscreen when they speak. The fact that Baigan lacks a portrait is a dead giveaway that he's not playable. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> remake, Baigan uses a palette-swapped generic soldier model, in contrast to the rather distinct-looking (though still a palette swap, but not as obvious) helmetless sprite he had in prior versions of the game, which gives away that he's not a very important character, and certainly not playable.
</li><li> In <em>The After Years</em>, checking the Hooded Man's equipment shows he uses his left hand to hold his sword, which is a huge hint on who he really is.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em>:
<ul><li> Faris is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">Bifauxnen</a>. You learn it early, but it's spoilered even earlier when you change jobs first: Faris uses female sprites (especially noticeable in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhiteMage">White Mage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMage">Black Mage</a> jobs). It's even more noticeable in the GBA port, where Faris has a clearly female face portrait.
</li><li> Exdeath's Castle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/VideoGameLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Awesome/VideoGameLevels">as climactic as it is</a>, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscOneFinalDungeon">not the final level</a>. How do we know this? We're still missing all of the level 6 spells, and almost half of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Summon Magic</a>. Granted, this game has a tendency toward the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, so a player without a guide could think they simply missed all of that...but there's no reasoning away the gaping holes in the game's bestiary for the GBA version.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>:
<ul><li> You can always go to the (empty) "esper" menu. Even though it's about a third of the way through before you properly find out what espers are and how they work.
</li><li> Also, the battle menu, specifically the discrepancy between Terra and every other party member. At first, she can only use magic, and there's a gap where her special ability would be. Similarly, characters like Locke and Edgar have their special abilities, and a gap where the magic would be. Think people will eventually be able to cast spells, or that Terra will develop a secret power? And if you still had any doubts, once Celes is recruited she has both a special ability <em>and</em> magic on her battle menu, verifying that it's not just weird formatting of Terra's menu.
</li><li> A lesser example is that none of the permanent playable characters are ever mentioned by name until you are given a chance to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelloInsertNameHere">choose what that name is.</a> This means that if you see a character mentioned by name and you are not given the chance to name them, you know for certain they will never join your party. It also means that, when the name entry screen comes up for a certain ninja before he joins, or a certain airship-owning gambler even before you meet him, you know that they are going to be part of your crew eventually.
</li><li> In the scenario where you have to save Terra from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, you get to command Locke and a gang of moogles. All but one of them won't allow you to change their equipment. The moogle whose gear can be changed freely will play a role later on.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> The digital re-release has an interface spoiler through its achievements notification. When you get to the absolute final battle against Sephiroth with only Cloud, you get to use Cloud's ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> Omnislash and there's an achievement for it. However, the achievement for Omnislash pops up as soon as the cut scene leading to the one on one battle starts. This can cause new players to immediately know the game isn't quite done yet. It also pops up if the player loses the battle against his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form.
</li><li> There's an subversion in the achievements as well. There's an achievement for every character using their Level 4 Limit Break, including Aeris/Aerith's. Unless you're specifically going for it, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she won't have enough kills through normal play before she's killed, and you won't be able to get the achievement on that playthrough. It also caused a variation on the old "Aerith comes back" rumors with the achievement cited as proof you can get her back.</span>
</li><li> In a similar subversion, long after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aerith is dead</span>, you can still buy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">staffs, such as the Fairy Tale</span>, or win similar weapons, despite the fact that said character never comes back. At this point they are only useful for the "Throw" command. Weapon-wise this is also played straight, however, due to the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Aerith does NOT get an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">ultimate weapon</a></span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The French translation did a Translation Spoiler by mistake: when you first arrive in Nibelheim with Sephiroth, Cloud asks him about his family. During <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sephiroth's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> of Cloud in the Whirlwind Maze</span>, Sephiroth answers "Ma mère s'appelait Jenova" (my mother's name was Jenova). But in the flashback in Kalm, he says "Ma mère était Jenova" (My mother was Jenova). Cue many players scratching theirs heads when he started to go psycho about the whole Jenova thing.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em>, Chapter 12 sees the player encountering various members of Avalanche as Cloud ascends the Sector 7 pillar. Early on, you'll find Biggs, who has been critically wounded fighting Shinra troops and passes on after having one last conversation with Cloud. However, checking the Chapter Select screen after completing the mission reveals that Biggs is listed as <em>comatose</em>, not dead, which wouldn't make sense considering that he was near the bottom of the pillar when it collapsed. This is a spoiler for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> in the ending that Biggs survived and was moved to the Leaf House in Sector 5, where he awakens from his coma during the final cutscene.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em>, where there's a certain character that enters your party long after you've met. You even get the chance to rename this character, odd as it might seem.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em>:
<ul><li> It's pretty obvious that one can tell that Marcus, Blank, and Beatrix aren't permanent party members simply because they have no "Trance" bar.
</li><li> Unlike the other members of your party, Zidane has Trance abilities that have nothing to do with his character class. Whereas everyone else's abilities augment their job-specific skills (Steiner the Knight does more damage; Garnet the Summoner casts stronger spells...), Zidane the Thief inexplicably gains access to a set of appallingly powerful offensive spells that will <em>always</em> do maximum damage. Even though Zidane's backstory isn't explored until Disc 3, this is a strong hint that there's more to him than meets the eye.
</li><li> If you play the Chocobo Hot and Cold mini-game as soon as you're able to on disc 1, you can obtain Chocographs that show areas that don't match the geography of the current continent, such as barren lands and icy fields compared to the mostly grassy lands you been traveling through. Looking up the "help" info for one of the graphs reveals that there's other continents you will explore besides the Mist Continent.
</li><li> Garnet being a summoner is spoiled as soon as you get control of her at the start of the game due to her Summon command already being available as well as her summons being listed in her ability list. Her summoning abilities isn't brought up until later when her mother extracts her summoning magic from her.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> has a fairly subtle one; four of your starting characters have two ATB slots and get a third when they become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TouchedByVorlons">l'Cie</a>. Vanille, however, already has three slots before this happens, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she already was a l'Cie before supposedly getting transformed alongside the rest of them, a fact also hinted at by her relatively high starting stats compared to the normal humans.</span>

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, you may notice when Roxas levels up, the notice has a yellow border.

</li><li> You'll find claws for Gabi on sale long before you even meet her. And equipment for Rufus is available in only one town (though by then you've already met him, and he offered to join your party more than once), but unless you backtrack immediately after he joins <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he gets killed by Gideon before you ever get the chance to shop for his equipment.</span>

<ul><li> The game does get around the "list expansion" business - there are no individual slots, just blank space. (Then again, in that game, your Persona headcount is set by your level, not the plot.)
</li><li> The game pulls a fakeout at one point where the stairs to the next area of Tartarus don't appear until a certain plot event, so it looks like you hit the top of the tower. Thing is, if you've been keeping up with Elizabeth's requests to defeat the various Hand enemies, you'll see a quest available to get Gold Medals from the Hands in a block you haven't been to yet...
</li><li> Averted for Fuuka though, where she plays a purely supporting role but if you go into your party menu you'll find she has a full set of combat stats like everyone else despite never actually entering battle like Mitsuru does.

</li><li> There are a ton of these around <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Arcana Hanged Man</span>. Despite all of your party members talking about how it's the final battle, it's pretty hard to miss that the Fool social link goes up to level <em>6</em> of 10 immediately before it.

The Link doesn't reach level 10 until you've found the path to the real ending. The same goes for the Star Social Link, since it only reaches Rank 10 after you speak to Teddie again after identifying the real killer, and he only gains his ultimate Persona just before rejoining the party</span>.
</li><li> After that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Judgement Social Link is unlocked and maxes out after apprehending the killer and defeating the "final" boss - but it's noticeable that there seems to be no more dungeon crawling after defeating said boss and, thus, no way to actually put to use the Ultimate Persona unlocked from the Link. This may have been intentional, at it's pretty much the <em>only</em> hint that there's still one more dungeon to go through for the true ending</span>.
</li><li> The true killer might stand out in the original version as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the only major character to not have a Social Link</span>. In the <em>Golden</em> remake, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this was changed and he's given a Social Link</span>, but at that point the killer's identity was largely a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LateArrivalSpoiler">Late-Arrival Spoiler</a> anyway. Still, if you did manage to go in unspoiled, you'd definitely raise an eyebrow upon seeing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his Arcana is the Jester — another 0, like your Fool. Or that his Link will only raise during plot events once it's past a certain level. His Social Link only maxes out after you reach the path to the true ending</span>.

</li><li> Rule of thumb for <em>Megami</em> games: If the game presents what appears to be the final dungeon or the final boss, experiment with some fusions.

</li><li> The worst offender is the DS version's "Dojo", which shows Magus in tech <em>screenshots</em> and it shows his two techs. <em>Before</em> you get him. The Item Encyclopaedia also shows weapons, which includes a portion of the list with scythes. Now who do we know that uses that type of weapon?

<ul><li> Before you even leave the first town, you get to talk to a vendor, who offers the game's blacksmithy screen.

</li><li> When you confront the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">completed Dragon God, the battle menu calls the boss the "TimeDevourer", even though the real Time Devourer is a different entity who isn't fought until a bit later as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.

<ul><li> The game also tries to trick you into thinking Nicolai is a main character. He's listed alongside the rest in the booklet, he's in your party at the very beginning, and is even the first character you control outside of combat. But checking his bio not only reveals that he is not what he claims to be, but is a bad guy as well!

Temporary followers also don't gain any experience. Also, characters from the various origin stories that will show up later in the game have a background to their character portrait, but ones that will be gone forever have a plain black background.

The only companions who <em>don't</em> get a special skill tree are Bethany/Carver, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leave no matter what after Act 1, either dying in the Deep Roads, becoming a Grey Warden, or joining their respective organization (Carver joins the Templars, Bethany is forced into the Circle of Magi). However, if they do not die, they can be brought back for the two DLC expansions (<em>Mark of the Assassin</em> and <em>Legacy</em>); if this is the case, they <em>do</em> have specialization trees and you can unlock new abilities for them.

Also, one of the initially greyed-out prestige classes is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Neverwinter Nine</span>, potentially spoiling the offer <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lord Nasher</span> makes to you much later in the game.
</li><li> Since the developers didn't bother to change the names of NPCs on-the-fly and weren't willing to outright lie to the player, you can tell that someone's going to try and deceive you about their identity if the overhead label that appears when you mouse over them says something vague, like "Man", instead of their actual name. <em>Mask of the Betrayer</em> demonstrates a plot-scripted character name change (Kaelyn the Dove can append a similar animal moniker to the end of your name), so we can put this down to Obsidian not caring enough.
</li><li> The identity of the main enemy of act one, the Githyanki, is revealed to the player by the interface almost immediately, but it takes most of the act for the characters to learn.

<ul><li> In both this game and its sequel, the squad selection screen has silhouettes of unrecruited party members.
</li><li> A minor one: when Shepard, Anderson and Nihlus view the transmission from Eden Prime, the subtitles identify the name of one of the soldiers under fire as Ashley, a good 10-15 minutes before she's properly introduced, while giving the other soldier a generic rank.
</li><li> The moment you gain control of Shepard in the first game, you can go to the Squad screen with three points to give to your character. When you check out the Charm and Intimidate skills, it cheerfully informs you that you'll be allowed more points for them once you become a Spectre. This despite the fact that you're still a whole cutscene away from even knowing you're up for it.
</li><li> During the opening moments of the first mission, you're given the option of removing Shepard and Alenko's helmets, but not Jenkins. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jenkins dies the moment they enter combat</span>.
</li><li> During the Noveria mission, the player comes across some bugs which, when aimed at, are identified as "Rachni". Naturally your party cannot see this, and will wonder what those bugs were until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>.
</li><li> The target of Garrus's personal mission claims he's someone else. The subtitles don't agree.
</li><li> Right at the beginning, on the ship, there's a greyed out option to open the galaxy map. If you try, it tells you that only the captain can do that, which is a pretty strong indicator that you will soon be in charge of the ship.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>:
<ul><li> The silhouettes are replaced with datacards with information about your future party members, since the point of the main quests is to recruit them. However, others that Cerberus wouldn't have been aware of (or would they?) like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legion</span> also have a datacard on your squad menu.
</li><li> In the prologue, the identity of your rescuers is initially unknown and Jacob makes a big point of telling you that it's Cerberus. Except that each of the five or so computers that you can interact with prior to that point are all named 'Cerberus Laptop'.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legion</span> is addressed by the name in the subtitles upon your first meeting, then reverts to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"geth"</span> the next time you speak.
<ul><li> The existence of a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">geth squadmate</span> is also partially spoiled by one of the upgrades you can pickup in the levels unlocked after Horizon being "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geth Shield Strength</span>". However, they try to disguise it by having its description refer to "squad members who use <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Geth shield technology</span>",
</li></ul></li><li> When you go into the Collector ship and find out the truth about them, the dialogue wheel, as usual, pops up before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a> has actually been said, and one of the dialogue options reads <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">"The Collectors are Protheans!"</span>
</li><li> If you go and customize your armor after the first mission (post-resurrection), you're allowed to pick what clothes you wear on the <em>Normandy</em>, which at this point is totally illogical given that the ship was destroyed in the tutorial level. Thus, the appearance of the second <em>Normandy</em> is somewhat less surprising.
</li><li> One of the DLC packs available on the Cerberus Network explicitly notes that it is an alternate costume for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garrus</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>:
<ul><li> If you import your character from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2">Mass Effect 2</a></em>, the game gives you a quick review of all the decisions you've made thus far. Most of them are expected, but one of them is the choice of whether or not you saved Maelon's data, which is treated as a fairly minor decision when you make it. This makes it clear that the data is going to have an impact later on regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the genophage cure</span>.
</li><li> Scanning all of the systems for Search-and-Rescue assets as soon as possible makes searching for similar assets later in the game a breeze. Each system has a percentage marker (up to 100%) located next to it that dials down after some main missions. Thus, it's easy to see at a glance what systems need to be visited (even for side missions that may have popped up), taking a lot of the guesswork out of the supposedly-sprawling galaxy.
</li><li> This is also averted in the same game during the mission on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Palaven</span>. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garrus</span> talks off screen they are listed as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Turian Soldier</span> in the subtitles. It's not until Shepard and the player actually see them that they are then listed under their own name.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffectAndromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a></em>. When first encountering the Kett and Remnant on Habitat 7 at the start of the game, they are simply identified as "Unknown". They only get their proper names after you learn their names.
</li><li> The "fill-in-the-blanks" party menu also appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic">Knights of the Old Republic</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em>. Basically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BioWare">BioWare</a> is <strong>very</strong> fond of this.

If you happen to do that in the Polar Academy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you will see that Atris is shaded slightly red, revealing that she is gradually falling to the dark side</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em>, Wild Flower has <em>two</em> portraits, one for each spirit possessing her. When Ya Zhen (the evil spirit) reveals that he may aid you in return for your support, it comes as little surprise.
</li><li> Some of the portraits are obscured with a big ol' "?" (and they're only silhouettes of heads) so it can be hard to tell who you can end up with. Even if you <em>were</em> expecting there to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EleventhHourRanger">another party member</a> during the Siege of Dirge since there was an open spot, you might not have expected it to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>.

To be fair, it's the most telegraphed spoiler in the game and bigger reveals are much better covered, but there you go. There's also one empty space in the affinity chart artwork for the party...
</li><li> The fact that the quests you get in some places, such as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Alcamoth or Mechonis</span> are ALL "timed", meaning you can't do them after a certain point, will also spoil for you that some large scale event is likely to occur in (or to) these places, and that the quests present will become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost forever</a>.
</li><li> There's also the fact there are no Heart-to-Hearts anywhere on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mechonis</span>...

During the attack on your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dunban</span> temporarily joins your party. If you go to his equipment screen, you'll notice his current gear can't be removed. Naturally the player would suspect he'd either be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> (heck, he pretty much has all the qualities of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion">Sacrificial Lion</a>) or at least would never join your party again. In fact... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he <em>does</em> rejoin you later as a fully customisable, playable character. It's his <em>sister</em>, the protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodFriend">Childhood Friend</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>, who's killed in the attack, and she <em>did</em> have fully customisable equipment at the time.</span>
</li><li> Played straight with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dickson, Mumkhar, and Alvis</span>, who are temporarily controllable but have fixed equipment, lack a Skill trait, and only have two very basic Arts. It's pretty clear they'll never be permanent party members.

<ul><li> There's an area in NLA called the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mimeosome Maintenance Center</span>.
</li><li> The first time you have a Heart-to-Heart with each of your different party members, you'll receive an achievement for it. Not so much for characters that are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownloadableContent">Downloadable Content</a> for Japan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and <em>The Master Sniper</em> though...</span> Heart-to-Hearts are also recorded on the map when they're found out and/or completed, and there's also an achievement for maxing out a party member's affinity, unless they're once again for said DLC characters in Japan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and for Lao</span>.
</li><li> During character creation, you can pick from a rather wild variety of skin, hair and eye colors, as well as some extremely non-human eyes. Moreover, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnusuallyUninterestingSight">nobody feels moved to comment about it</a> if you do. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is because you're customizing your mimeosome, rather than a biological human body. Nobody comments because they all know you're a tricked-out robot, even if you don't at first.</span> For that matter, in character creation <em>none</em> of the eye designs <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">look all that natural</span>.
</li><li> Chapter 3 introduces you to the Prone race with the implication that they were behind the destruction of Earth, and the base you encounter them in also has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMook">Puge and Pugilith</a> support. Chapter 4 then formally introduces the Ganglion coalition as a whole, which the Prone are just one race in. However, the enemy index entries on the Prone, Puges and Pugiliths (accessible as soon as you engage any of them in combat) mention the Ganglion before you even hear of them in-story. On another note, the entry for the Prone lists them with "Cavern Clan" in parentheses, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">indicating that not only are the Prone divided into two races/clans, there are a few mission-exclusive fights with Tree Clan Prone, the aforementioned second Prone clan that becomes one of your allies</span>. On a <em>further</em> note, there's an Achievement called <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cavern Clan Immigration</span>, implying <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the seemingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> clan of Prone will become allies too.</span>
</li><li> The "[Race] Immigration" achievements usually don't spoil much seeing as the race names won't mean much until you meet them, with two exceptions: the one listed above is one, but you get "<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Definian</span> Immigration" for completing a quest that involves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> of <em>one</em> of their race, and it isn't until the post game that only a couple more join in.
</li><li> It might seem a little odd that the Enforcer healing skill is called "Repair". It removes debuffs as well as heals, so maybe it's just named a little thematically for the high-tech setting of <em>Xenoblade X</em>? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Well, yes, but there's a bit more to it than that. This even ties in to Irina mentioning getting repaired during an early affinity mission and she herself having the art.</span>
</li><li> Ever wonder why the empty bottom left section of NLA has a survey percentage number like the rest of the districts?
</li><li> Irina and Gwin of Team Irina can join you on missions, despite technically being part of another BLADE team, with Irina even leading it as Team Irina. They have another member, Marcus, who curiously never actually becomes playable. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">There's a fairly good reason for that, and it involves a lot of Ganglion missiles.</span>
</li><li> One of the categories in the Enemy Index is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chimeroids</span>, and a category of Criticals Up and Slayer augments exist for this enemy type, all of which can be seen long before you encounter them.
</li><li> After you defeat Luxaar for good and go through the cutscene, you earn a story achievement. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">But because the progress says <em>4/5</em>, you know there's still more...</span>
</li><li> Subverted before proceeding to Chapter 11. Both of Gwin's Affinity Missions need to be completed to begin, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but nothing happens to Gwin at all</span>.

<ul><li> You gain access to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mons">Blade</a> Library, which keeps track of all the unique Blades you've summoned/obtained. It also shows the silhouettes of every single Blade you haven't obtained yet. Some of them will look rather familiar and they also appear at the top of list alongside those of Rex, Nia, and Tora's, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which makes it evident that both Morag and Zeke become party members eventually</span>.
</li><li> The fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mòrag will join the party</span> is practically given away if the party decides to do a sidequest in Mor Ardain the second it becomes available. The sidequest in question leads to a murder investigation, but you are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityRequiredToProceed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbilityRequiredToProceed">blocked from proceeding until you get the help of someone familiar with Mor Ardain</a>. At that point, there's really only one candidate for this: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mòrag</span>.
</li><li> Similarly, while the game tries to avert this by giving a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a> a full skill tree, exp gain, customizable moves, and favored consumables, the fact that they can't bond with any Blades besides their starting one, and that said starting Blade's affinity level never increases, should raise some eyebrows.
</li><li> Some items will list the names of locations you haven't actually been to yet in their "Obtained at" description.
</li><li> Done with Floren in the Mercenary Missions menu. Assigning Floren to a job that requires a Blade of a specific gender reveals that Floren's a guy, but the boy himself never tells the party this until the end of his sidequest, in which they all react with complete surprise.
</li><li> During chapter 1, Nia, Jin, and Malos all join Rex's party. The fact that Nia is the only one of the three whose party artwork is in the same style as Rex's should make it clear which of the three will end up being a permanent party member.
</li><li> The Indoline Praetorium doesn't have any Heart-to-Hearts, there are no quests after the initial ones, and there aren't any Merc Missions to increase its stores' inventories, a clue that something major will happen to the place later on.

So when you encounter an enemy that has animation and is the same size as your party members, you know they'll be fighting alongside you at some point (unless that enemy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was already playable, like Oersted or Straybow)</span>.

<ul><li> The game makes new areas available via progression of a storyline divided in several chapters. Another mechanic lets you unlock new game features as a reward for certain in-game accomplishments. One set of these makes new items available in shops and works in such a way that the possibility to get extra items in the shops from the second town only becomes visible once it has been unlocked for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstTown">First Town</a>. The story initially gives the impression that there are only three places that qualify as towns in the game and that unlocking the option for the third town is the only way to buy some of the crafting materials. Hey, what do you mean "choose this for extra items from travelling merchants and the store in Elderwood." ? <em>What</em> store in Elderwood? That place is just a forest full of monsters with no settlement of any kind. Well, it does have a strange statue and a bridge that can't be crossed...

</li><li> Another Gwent related one. The Mysterious Elf, whose identity remains a secret for much of the game has Gwent card of his own. When playing against opponents who use this card it is simply labeled "Mysterious Elf". However, it's possible to get a copy of your own before learning the Elf's identity in story, and the 'new card' notification practically blurts out his real name: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Avallac'h</span>.

During the field exercises that take place each month, the students of the branch campus make camp at locations called Ex Camps. When one sees the map of Erebonia, they can also see all the locations marked "Ex Camp" on the map, no matter how early in the game they are. This can spoil the locations of the future field exercises if the player hasn't progressed far enough in the story.

These are the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vile God Story and Evil Goddess Story and the fact that there even <em>exists</em> an Evil Goddess is intended as a pretty major plot revelation in the Evil Goddess Story as there is nothing in the other two stories that even hints at this. However, the trophies/achievements for these are named "Vile God Story Cleared" and "Evil Goddess Story Cleared" and trophy guides for <em>Advent Dark Force</em> don't generally go to any effort to hide the names of these story modes.</span>

If you open the menu, he clearly isn't listed among your party members, spoiling that he will leave very shortly after, before you get any chance to use him in a battle.

<ul><li> In most <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombat">Ace Combat</a></em> games, <em>2</em> being one of the exceptions, you can see in the hangar and plane select screens boxes either unselectable or empty that give away how many more planes can be bought.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">Dwarf Fortress</a></em> attempted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">avert</a> this but couldn't fully. While in development, it was realized that vampires would be unable to infiltrate the player's fortress without the UI giving them away. So, the UI and a few game mechanics were changed to accommodate vampire infiltration, including:
<ul><li> Dwarves disappearing and anonymous crimes. In the old system, you are informed when a dwarf is attacked or killed and told who the culprit is. Now, you are only informed if there is a witness to notice the deed. Dwarves who haven't been seen recently are quietly added to a list of missing units, crimes will likewise be silently added to the justice screen if there are no witnesses. So dwarves can turn up dead and you won't know who killed them, but if you're attentive you'll know they vanished. Vampires can also frame other dwarves for their crimes.
</li><li> Migrant skills. Vampires were given old, unused skills before other migrants were. So, the vampire was the only newcomer with a half-forgotten trade. All migrants can have old skills now.
</li><li> Fake identities. Previously, you knew almost everything to know about a dwarf by reading his bio. Now they can assume false identities to hide their real age and potentially lengthy kill records. Their relationships can hint at their identity: a spouse not present in the fortress or armies of relatives suggest a vampire. This is where the aversion of the trope fails: if the dwarf worships a god then that deity will be listed as a relationship. The deity's history can be viewed, providing a list of worshipers and curse victims, and listing a vampire's original identity. If you assign a nickname to a dwarf, <em>the list will display the nickname rather then the assumed and real names</em>. Thus, vampires can be spotted via the UI by nicknaming all newcomers, because giving Urist McCheesemaker the nickname "Doofus" results in the god's history reading "Cursed 'Doofus' McStonecrafter to prowl the night in search of blood".
</li><li> With the advent of messages in dwarf thoughts expressing horror at the death of other dwarfs, vampires can now be outed by their own bios - if a dwarf is horrified at the death of Urist McDrainedOfBlood, it's pretty good odds they're the vampire, especially if you hadn't actually found out that Urist McDrainedOfBlood was dead yet since nobody had stumbled on the body.
</li><li> One that has nothing to do with vampires: Setting up a lever and trying to link it to a weapon or spike trap can be used to detect early on whether or not your fortress's territory includes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an upright masterwork adamantine sword, the kind used to seal a Demonic Fortress.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The ledger keeping track of the population in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HometownStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HometownStory">Hometown Story</a></em> gives a couple of things away:
<ul><li> The golden watch necklace can be seen on Carl's sprite before he actually acquires it.
</li><li> By default, it lists members of the same family one after the other. This includes a family tie that is only revealed long after the involved characters are introduced.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TIEFighter">TIE Fighter</a></em> makes use of a number of elements which can spoil upcoming plot points or the introduction of new equipment:
<ul><li> <em>All</em> objectives for a given mission are listed on the relevant screen from the start, meaning many plot twists or other developments can be inferred from the presence of objectives not mentioned in the briefing.
</li><li> Any cockpit displays not currently needed in a particular craft are plated over. This includes a space for the beam weapon display, hinting at its introduction later in the game.
</li><li> The player's training certificate includes obvious spaces for the TIE Advanced, TIE Defender, and Missile Boat, the first of which they won't get to fly until midway through the fifth campaign, and the last of which won't appear until the <em>tenth</em>. Similarly, later versions of the game allowed the player access to training simulations for all three craft from the beginning.

Naturally, the end of the very next chapter reveals that Lyn is, in fact, a long-lost noble.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game plays with this a bit in regards to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaze</span> on the <em>Birthright</em> route. Despite potentially suffering a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Plotline Death</a>, this character can still S-Support with any of the Hoshidan women; not allowing him to do so would have been a dead giveaway. However, at the same time, if you pay close attention, you might notice that the sidequest housing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kaze's daughter</span> does <em>not</em> immediately unlock after he gets married, like it does for all the other men. While it doesn't hint at what you need to do to save him, it does somewhat give away that something important can happen to him.
</li><li> Also played with regarding <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Gunter</span>. This character appears to have an unavoidable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotlineDeath">Plotline Death</a> early on, but if you had them fight alongside the Avatar or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jakob</span>, the heart animation that indicates gaining support points appears. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest Star Party Members</a> in <em>Fire Emblem</em> rarely have supports, so this seems like a dead giveaway that it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a> and they'll rejoin eventually. On <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Conquest</em></span>, this is true. On <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Birthright</em></span>, they really are gone for good, and on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>Revelation</em>, they rejoin but can't support with anyone, hinting that this trope is in play again. But it's ultimately subverted there, as despite Gunter being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">Demonic Possession</a>, he's technically still playable throughout the entire route apart from the chapter he's fought in.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> V: Hammers of Fate</em>, reading the hero Laszlo's biography immediately spoils the later reveal that "Saint Isabel" is really Biara. That's quite a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainObviousReveal">Captain Obvious Reveal</a>, but it has a heavy impact on the plot regardless.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercsOfBoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MercsOfBoom">Mercs of Boom</a></em>, you can immediately see all your possible research items, including things that have to do with aliens. Except you have no idea that aliens even exist for about a third of the game. Their appearance is supposed to be a complete surprise. It's not clear why the developers chose not to hide the unavailable research options.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProjectXZone">Project X Zone</a></em>, there are quite a few instances between chapters when it seems like a character, for some reason or other, has left the party, but one quick look at the party setup on the intermission screen will tell you that that's not the case. This is especially jarring with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostsNGoblins">Arthur's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyDeath">Disney Death</a>.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShiningForce">Shining Force</a></em> series, the Egress spell is often reserved for the hero of each game to allow the team to make a quick escape when things go bad. However, in <em>Shining Force: The Sword of Hajya</em>, the mage Natasha is the only non-hero character in the series who can also learn Egress. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In Chapter 3, the party is forcibly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpgang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsSplitUpgang">split up</a>, with the hero leading one team, while Natasha assumes the leadership role for the other.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StellaGlow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StellaGlow">Stella Glow</a></em> has a few examples as well as one aversion:
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Klaus</span> becomes unavailable for support conversations prior to maxing out, suggesting there's more than meets the eye there. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He reveals he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong">Evil All Along</a> and leaves the party late in the game, although getting his Affinity as high as you're allowed to unlocks a character needed for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>.</span>
</li><li> Niki introduces herself to the party as the Earth Witch, but has no attacks or magic when seen in battle. (Also, the <em>real</em> Earth Witch is on the game's cover, so this isn't really meant to fool the players at all. That <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the real Niki has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a> and this Niki was a mud doll created by the real Earth Witch, her younger sister Mordimort...</span><em>that's</em> still meant to be surprising.
</li><li> In Chapters 6 and 8, you often fight all the Harbingers at once. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">You might notice that Hrodulf has a full complement of passives, whereas the other three still have room for more...yeah, that's because he makes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> at the end of Chapter 8 while still an NPC while the rest of them officially become playable characters in Chapter 9.</span>
</li><li> If you took on the job quests at the Red Bear Inn, you might notice that they become unavailable if you get their mastery level to 3 stars before Chapter 8. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Franz is killed during the angelic invasion of Lambert and is replaced as shopkeeper by his daughter Rena, meaning <em>she'll</em> always be the one you're helping for the final leg of the Franz Atelier quest.</span> The others get put on hold at the same point to disguise this, causing the aversion. Though the fact that the limit exists in the first place might still count as a spoiler that <em>something's</em> up.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWars">Super Robot Wars</a></em>, the games mark which units will you be forced to deploy next chapter. It gives away which series will be the focus next chapter, though sometimes this means they might just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidSeasonUpgrade">get a new robot</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigDamnHeroes">will appear midway the fight to save the day</a>. This is a good thing, since if they're low in upgrades that's your chance to not get stuck in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">unwinnable</a> situation, but still. The Z2 games feature another one in that every unit's map sprite faces either to the left (if it's a protagonist) or to the right (if it's an antagonist). If someone joins up but they're facing right, expect a betrayal (though this part is averted in Z3). The fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">the crashed ship on Enceladus</a> was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Yukikaze</span> was a plot point that wasn't revealed until the end of a scenario in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsV">Super Robot Wars V</a></em>. However, if you move your cursor over the ship, the map data flat out tells you its name.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsX">Super Robot Wars X</a></em>: The fact that "Steel Warriors" by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamProject">Jam Project</a></em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">isn't playing in the background in the IF Route <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight suggests there's one more boss to fight.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Whether or not a soldier manages to land a lethal hit on an alien in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOMEnemyUnknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a></em> is spoiled if the camera pans over them as they take the shot. Conversely, if the camera pans over an alien, you can rest assured that the next scene will consist of one of your soldiers dying.
<ul><li> Averted by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCOM2">XCOM 2</a></em>. Now the camera has a chance of panning for any shot taken, even if it's non-lethal - hell, even if it <em>misses</em>.
</li><li> On the other hand, in <em>XCOM 2: War of the Chosen</em>, the Assassin is an alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthExpert">Stealth Expert</a> who darts across the map in Concealment before springing an ambush on your squad. But if she rolls the "Watchful" trait as one of her special abilities, she'll enter Overwatch at the end of her double move, and the little icon will appear over her exact location. She won't be officially revealed and targetable by normal shooting, but if you have a grenade launcher or other AoE attack...
</li><li> Though it's only a one-time occurrence, you'll get the achievement pop-up when the game calculates that you've gotten it (e.g. mind-controlling an Ethereal in <em>Enemy Unknown</em>), which means you get the award for doing the thing as soon as you've told a soldier to do the thing instead of after your soldier did the thing.

This can make some later deductions in cases a lot easier than they're supposed to be, because if you're right at the end of a case and have a piece of evidence you haven't used yet, it's very likely to be the solution.
</li><li> The last witness of any given trial is nearly always the true killer. This can cause related videos on YouTube to inadvertently spoil the killer if they're the last or so part of the case. However, the series sometimes shakes this up in the final trial, where is several games the last witness is not the killer, and sometimes the game's true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> is never even cross-examined in person.
</li><li> In some of the games, the protagonist will rearrange their evidence, which removes evidence that is no longer related to the case. If something seems irrelevant but stays in your inventory, you can guarantee it will end up important later in the case.

<ul><li> The secret files very often contain rather blatant spoilers for things that will come up in a cutscene after leaving the room they were acquired in. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that most people would view said files the minute they get them...which is <em>before</em> the cutscenes happen. Some of the files even spoil big game plot points like it's practically nothing. Woe betide the unfortunate soul who decides to go for the files on their first playthrough and read them all, <em>especially</em> if they're playing on Hard (which gives you more files).
</li><li> The flowchart is also a big source of spoilers. By taking a look at the branches, you can tell how much story it will provide. So you'd probably think that the longest one is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>... and that's exactly the case. It doesn't stop there, though: because the "Ally" option is always the left one at a junction and the "Betray" one is always the one going right, you can tell if it's better to ally or to betray in most cases. On a side note, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the trope is subverted with Tenmyouji's ending, because its branch gets suddenly expanded when you reach its apparent tip.

<ul><li> In a scene in the last third of the sequel, Cole, Zeke and Kuo have a serious discussion in a train car about whether Cole is physically and mentally ready to use the RFI, having found "the last Blast Core".

<ul><li> If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">Always Save the Girl</a> has a spoilered out description, the love interest most likely died.
</li><li> If you're on the character page for any work with a mystery central to the plot and you see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler">someone whose description is 90% spoiler-tagged</a>, congrats, you have probably just found the villain.
</li><li> Even if the work tries to avoid this by having a separate "Antagonists" section and warning of unmarked spoilers in there, it's still very easy to find the villain. If a character has a deceptively small list of tropes in the normal characters section, and a one-line spoiler underneath their profile, said spoiler will almost <em>always</em> be "For tropes pertaining to them after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">The Reveal</a>, see the Antagonists section." The opposite can also happen, which is even worse.
</li><li> In works that have voice acting involved, if a mysterious character's voice actor is spoilered out, chances are whoever voices the character already voices someone in the current cast (and is either that character in disguise, or is otherwise closely connected to said character). If it's a character that as far as you know doesn't or can't talk, even an all-spoilered out blotch where a voice actor's name or a quote would go is a giveaway that they break their silence at some point.
</li><li> If said <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler">Walking Spoiler</a> suddenly dies half-way through the first episode, then even the sheer <em>number</em> of tropes associated with them, spoilered out or not, can spoil that they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotQuiteDead">Not Quite Dead</a> and will come back at some point.
</li><li> If part of someone's <em>name</em> is spoilered out, you've probably got a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomatoInTheMirror">Tomato in the Mirror</a> on your hands.
</li><li> Entries on a work's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> page which simply say "[Character]'s <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">death."</span> Not too hard to figure that out... Seriously, people, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/SelfFulfillingSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/SelfFulfillingSpoiler">is it that difficult to put the spoiler tags on the character's name and not their death?</a>
</li><li> It's common to see a trope description take some form of "Looks like it's going to be subverted, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but then it's played straight.</span> The spoiler tag isn't really hiding anything in such cases. Then again, even if you don't insert the "looks like it's going to be subverted" part but just add a spoiler tag just after the unspoilered part of some trope description, you're actually strongly hinting at some kind of trope subversion.
</li><li> If a work seems cheerful and bright, but has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/DarthWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/DarthWiki">Darth Wiki</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a> tab, chances are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCreepy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseCreepy">there will be much more to the work than meets the eye</a>. The same could apply to the existence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">Tear Jerker</a> tabs, to a lesser extent.
</li><li> Any mention of a villain that mentions he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a>, and then a short spoiler in parentheses. In most cases you can guess that this villain will be the true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoDragons">Co-Dragons</a> along with a second villain or not going to last long.
</li><li> If the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> entry on a page mentions a villain's name but there is a spoiler in the entry then it is a safe bet that this villain is just the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneFinalBoss">Disk-One Final Boss</a> or working with a second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenVillain">Hidden Villain</a>.
</li><li> A similar case to the <em>Ace Attorney</em> example can occur on TV Tropes character pages too. If a named character from a work is built up as important, but doesn't have an entry at all on the characters page, chances are it's because they're an alias for someone who <em>does</em> have an entry. The same happens if the character has a character page entry, but no image to go with it. In that case it's a safe bet that their appearance is the same as someone else's.
</li><li> The generally frowned-upon format of dedicating spoiler tags just to a character's gender, either because of a reveal involving them, or because it isn't their true gender, will usually be very obvious no matter how the spoilers are added. In the former case, either the gender distribution of the work is even enough that simply their gender isn't enough to reveal anything, or the gender ratio is heavily skewed in one direction and their gender only has any need to be spoilered at all if they are in the minority gender, which would stick out like a sore thumb anyway. In the latter case, it still sticks out like a sore thumb and hints at a reveal the reader probably wouldn't be suspecting if the spoiler tags weren't there or applied differently.
</li><li> Similarly to the above, if a character is referred to by a gender-neutral pronoun such as "they" or "their", it could be a sign that their gender is not what you're initially led to believe it is.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathTropes">Death Tropes</a> as listed on a character page is sort of a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't situation. One one hand, spoiling the name of the trope will give the reader nothing to go on, so curiosity may entice them to highlight it anyway. On the other hand, leaving the name of a trope like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">Killed Off for Real</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadAllAlong">Dead All Along</a> ends up covering up approximately nothing.
</li><li> If you wish to edit a page that has spoiler tropes on it, there's nothing you can do except try to avoid the very visible spoilers. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Or just watch/read the work in question before you edit. Of course, there are also the pages <em>about</em> spoilers...</span>
</li><li> Similarly, if you want to avoid spoilers, <em>don't</em> click the "Related" tab. This subpage lists <em>every</em> page on the wiki that has a pothole to the page you're viewing.
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/BetterThanItSounds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/BetterThanItSounds">Better Than It Sounds</a> pages, it can be easy to tell what a franchise is depending on the amount of examples. For example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> has about 26 entries, and not a lot of other things have that many.
</li><li> On pages which have different color palettes, like YMMV or Darth Wiki, a link that was hidden within a spoiler used to be faintly visible. This was fixed, though hovering the mouse over a spoiler tag and finding a hidden link will cause the cursor react to a clickable link, which on some browsers shows the URL for the link. This is why some editors frown upon hiding links in spoiler tags.
</li></ul></li><li> Choose-Your-Own-Adventures videos on YouTube, or videos with heavy use of the Annotations, fall for this if they use repeated clips for their bad endings, as viewers can look at the url of the video in question and turns the video into a game of Guess Who.
</li><li> This is essentially the reason for the existence of Polsy, which lets you display YouTube videos on a separate screen; so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/SomethingAwful">Something Awful</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Lets Players</a> can host their videos on YouTube without the Related Videos spoiling the story.
</li><li> NFL Sunday Ticket's online streaming app will pop up alerts for scoring plays. However, since the video is often a play or two behind, you often get the score alert before seeing the ball snapped.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/IMDB">IMDB</a> can reveal a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingSpoiler">Walking Spoiler</a> if the actor is credited as a too-revealing name. Back when there were character pages, clicking one could reveal an awful truth. Though there still is a minor one when clicking the character name, given it shows images and quotes that might be revealing.
</li><li> If you type certain search terms into a search engine, such as Google, you can get somewhat spoileriffic results from even the suggested search terms. For an example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, "Reiner Braun <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is a Titan</span>."
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuh8Im3Lo3E6VtvOD9uebrgTS3YKzzooc">TheRealNinjaBoy's Nomad Adventure<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is an aversion of this. For context, the Nomad Adventure is a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em> run in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalDeathMode">Hardcore Mode</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He dies in <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTyK-0V4aoQ">Part 15<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, about 17 minutes into the video, but in an example similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Frazz">Frazz's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledByTheFormat">Spoiled by the Format</a> aversion, there's about 15 minutes of a black screen in order to throw viewers off of his trail.</span> He lampshades this in the comments section.

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/NorthernLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/NorthernLion">Northern Lion</a> acknowledged in episode 4 of his <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em> playthrough that his viewers would be able to guess whether he would succeed or fail a given boss fight based on how close to the end of the episode it was. At the time, the counter and scrub bar were constantly visible below the video instead of as an overlay that only appears when you mouse over it. This could apply to any Let's Play that always ends its episodes at a logical point such as the end of a level.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation">Western Animation</a></span>
</p><ul><li> The episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> in which Poof is introduced is sometimes broadcasted as a two-parter and not in a single episode. Poof only gets his name at the end of the second part (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> in the episode is several characters coming up with various names for Poof). The first part, however (which ends shortly after Poof is born) clearly has Poof's name written in the end credits (and just to drive the point across, it's written as "Baby Poof", making absolutely sure people know who this is referring to).
