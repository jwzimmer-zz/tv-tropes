However, actual plain-looking actors (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleStandard">especially women</a>) are almost never cast for leading roles in Hollywood, so the person cast is more gorgeous than most people you'd meet in real life. Producers know that "beauty is money," and they're disinclined to cast <em>genuinely</em> unattractive people even as villains or extras, and would rather <em>imply</em> homeliness via character-reactions.
</p><p>Characters are made "plain" by giving them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlassesGottaGo">thick glasses</a>, braces, freckles, unfashionable clothes, an unflattering hairstyle, and surrounding them with people who are more attractive. A subtle method used is to give the actor clothes that clash with their natural skin color, making them look pale or blotchy, a method also used in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeforeAndAfterPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeforeAndAfterPictures">before-and-after</a>" shots for diet-pill commercials.

Likewise a character can be oblivious to their own good looks and have a poor self-image without being considered Hollywood Homely. Beauty is very subjective in real-life, and this trope only counts if the character is considered unattractive by the majority in-universe.

<ul><li> Teleflora. The theme in their <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2nOahrCUQE">2010 Super Bowl commercial<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is <em>supposed</em> to be "Hot but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">bitchy girl</a> gets the bad flowers; frumpy but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyOfficeGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyOfficeGirl">hard-working girl</a> gets the good flowers." Apparently, "frumpy" means "not willing to wear short skirts and go-go boots to work".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DisneyChannel">Disney Channel</a> used to run a PSA that was all over this trope. A very attractive teenager is sitting in front of a poster of a pop star, lamenting how plain and unattractive she is. The pop star springs to life from the poster and tells the girl that she shouldn't worry, because it's all Hollywood magic. The pop star is then stripped of all the makeup, fancy clothes, etc, and reduced to ... really attractive.
</li><li> American Eagle's Aerie Real campaign, which features the slightly plump plus-size model Iskra Lawrence as their spokesperson, is a slave to this trope. Iskra, bless her, frequently uses her fame to speak out for a "realistic body image" for girls. Thing is, <a class="urllink" href="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/3a/80/40/3a80403492df20a6d0ac721817614291.jpg">she's STUNNING.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> Although as she points out, for years she couldn't get a modeling contract because, by the standards of that hideous industry, she is homely. Aerie eventually tripped over the trope by launching the oh so funny parody video for their nonexistent "Aerie Men" campaign, which featured a bunch of chubby guys feeling good about their body image. Nope. Sorry, men are not allowed to be happy as they are.
</li><li> This trope isn't limited to humans. Ugly Animal Preservation Society ran a campaign to choose its mascot. Eventually, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blobfish">the blobfish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is indeed ugly, won the most votes, but second place went to <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo">the kakapo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a cute, fluffy parrot.
</li><li> Whether the winner of the World's Ugliest Dog Contest is legitimately hideous (Mugly, Elwood, most infamously Sam), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UglyCute">Ugly Cute</a> (Gus, Yoda), or normal-looking with some unfortunate features (Walle's strange mish-mash of body parts, Pabst's underbite) varies from year to year
</li><li> In a Dannon Oikos Greek yogurt ad, two ladies are discussing how eating it turns the next man you see into John Stamos. The man who comes in next is treated as if he's an unattractive slob but is actually an above average looking guy with a sunburn. The comments on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> posting of the advert verify this with many girls saying they thought the first guy was hot and some preferring him over John Stamos.
</li><li> SlimQuick commercials, which advertise drinks to women. The commercial starts off with an overweight couple, and as the woman talks about all they've been doing to lose weight, the man gets skinnier while the woman gets frustrated. The commercial ends showing the woman how skinny she would look if she tried the drink. But due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenericCuteness">Generic Cuteness</a>, both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulMan">man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBeautifulWoman">woman</a> were already attractive before they both lost weight, whereas after they just look generically good looking.

Despite being tall, very muscular, having a chiseled face, a deep voice, and a masculine attitude, Ganju, unfortunately, lives in a world where most of the male characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a>, and is thus considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonk</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">by the local dandy</a>, Yumichika.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BoysOverFlowers">Boys over Flowers</a>,</em> Makino Tsukushi is frequently called plain.

It's ultimately averted as the only people who claim she isn't cute are people who hate her.
</li><li> Gohan during his high school days in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> looks dorky in his baggy clothes and is shy enough that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkJock">Jerk Jock</a> Sharpner and other boys mock him for being a nerd calling him brain boy. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Subverted</a> with the girls: Erasa has the hots for Gohan as soon he comes into class and tries to get him to take her home when school finishes and Angela draws pictures of Gohan in class and makes trouble just so she can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandingInTheHall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandingInTheHall">stand next to Gohan in the hall and ask him out</a>. Videl treats him like a weak loser at first but warms up to him quickly and marries Gohan years later.
</li><li> Downplayed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>. The running gag about Bulma's boobs starting to become saggy is clearly a crack about her age, but at the same time, the gag never explicitly says that they (or Bulma) are growing less attractive as a result; just more saggy/chronologically older. Not to mention, her <em>Super</em> redesign clearly makes her look much younger than how she appeared during the Buu saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken">Genshiken</a></em> plays with this trope. Ohno is called an "Ordinary person who is cute" and that Saki is "like a model", but Ohno is just as attractive as Saki. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">The main difference is the effort the two put into their appearances</a> - Ohno <em>doesn't</em> outside of cosplay (where heads turn so fast you could hear bones snap), while Saki puts in the effort to maintain a model-like air and appearance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CountCain">Godchild</a>,</em> In the <em>Scold's Bridle</em> story arc.
<ul><li> Drew is supposedly so plain that other upper-class girls won't give her the time of day - something which the mangaka illustrates by giving her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Meganekko">quite good-looking round glasses</a>, freckles and a braid. (She also seems to have real curves compared to the waifish characters) The art style may be partly at fault, but the fact remains that she looks no less pretty than any other girl in the manga.
</li><li> Viola wears a mask because she is disfigured, but when she takes it off <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it turns out that her face is perfectly fine apart from a finger-sized acid burn on one cheek. This one is justified in that she is insane and is probably exaggerating the extent of her scarring</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gokusen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gokusen">Gokusen</a></em>: Quite a few characters like to point out how "plain" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">The Protagonist</a> is. This also comes into play in the drama, but here she is played by <a class="urllink" href="http://wallpaperzoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Yukie-Nakama-Sexy-Wallpaper.jpg">Yukie Nakama<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HowlsMovingCastle">Howl's Moving Castle</a></em> is a complicated case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope">Playing with a Trope</a>.
<ul><li> Sophie considers herself plain compared to her sister. Her sister looks like a garish parody plastered with makeup, while Sophie's features are more natural. However, the soldiers at the beginning of the movie and Howl himself seem to find Sophie quite attractive and The Witch of the Waste curses her with truly ugly old age because she feels threatened by her.
</li><li> Given the nature of the curse, there's also the implication that a lot of Sophie's "homeliness" are self-esteem issues on her part. In scenes where she shows confidence, she becomes younger and prettier while insecurity or defensiveness lead to the older and wrinkled curse form.
</li></ul></li><li> Lina Inverse from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> is described as being awkward in appearance, ranging from flat-chested to lanky to having a pug nose. While it's true that she occasionally travels with the scantily-clad, buxom Naga, the beautiful Sylphiel, or the short-but-busty Amelia, Lina is regularly drawn in a very attractive light and seems to only slightly pale in comparison to her female companions' exceptional beauty.

However, it is noted (even the characters state it), that she looks almost exactly like Kikyo, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her previous incarnation</span>, who is stated to be beautiful. In Inuyasha's case, this may be justified; he recognizes Kagome by smell, not sight and he probably finds the scent of things like body wash and shampoo strange and off-putting.

Naruto also makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gonk">Gonkish</a> faces frequently in comical situations and is beaten up once by Sasuke's fangirls for an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalKiss">Accidental Kiss</a> between the two. Naruto is cute at first with a horrible clothing choice and style (basically an orange jumpsuit) but as he gets older he incorporates more black into his outfit, gets taller, and becomes quite handsome as well. It's established when comparing him to his parents that he got both their good looks. Even so, when Naruto is made aware of Hinata's feelings towards him he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsecureLoveInterest">can't fathom why someone as pretty and nice as her would like someone like him</a>. Sakura also mentions that Hinata is "almost too good" for him and Naruto immediately agrees. He is drawn unflatteringly in certain scenes even as he gets older and becomes a father to Hinami and Boruto while Hinata is still as pretty as ever. However, on the whole when he's drawn or animated at his best he's actually quite attractive. Such as one scene in the anime where his hair gets wet and he shakes it dry while a girl <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">watches him with her mouth agape</a>. Also, he gets just as many fangirls as Sasuke when he demonstrates his hero credentials in defeating Pain and saving Konoha. It's implied they're attracted to him not just because of his heroics in battle but his appearance as well.

<ul><li> The short-time member Marrow is a complicated example that has more to do with her self-confidence and backstory than anything else. In her original appearances as a Morlock terrorist and her initial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, she <em>was</em> quite ugly (to varying degrees <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a>). During an adventure on an alien planet, however, Marrow was wounded and placed in a regeneration chamber, which also smoothed her facial features. Despite her newfound beauty, she was still self-conscious about her appearance due to having a visible mutation and the fact that her mutation involves growing more bones out of her body.
</li><li> Callisto, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> of the Morlocks, is a similar case. The Morlocks are a group of mutants that live in the sewer because their mutations make them look deformed and inhuman, and therefore easy to recognize and target among normal humans. While most of them are distinctively inhuman in appearance, Callisto herself is not, as she is actually originally beautiful in her pre-Morlock life, but "ugly" because of her now-usually unkempt, haggard, and malnourished appearance due to living homeless in sewers, and also due to the facial scars she got in a fight (which actually amounts to one lost eye) rather than because of her mutation, but because of her solidarity with the Morlocks she has a similar view of herself. But a 90's storyline involved her being stripped of her memories and healed of her scars and her missing eye, at which point, she actually became a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">supermodel</a></em> when she lived a normal life in New York City, although she regained those scars and lost her eye again — and regained her memories — in yet another fight, at which point she returned to being a raggedy sewer-dweller. However, she has still remained reasonably attractive ever since then, depending on the artist. Although she did briefly have her arms replaced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatTentacles">Combat Tentacles</a> — in exchange for having the rest of her supermodel appearance restored, with her scars removed and eye healed, when she became a freelance mercenary — she lost those after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HouseOfM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HouseOfM">M-Day</a> and is now <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ0g2dJpdupvRzRBiUPRKjGlMPUZP3rH5uJC_Q1lj4eqcw_NOuR">back to living in sewers and just as "ugly" as she ever was originally (minus the scarring though she wears the eye-patch for cosmetic purposes)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which is to say that she's still rather attractive, just not <em>supermodel</em>-attractive, like the average comic-book leading-lady, pending adequate nutrition and proper grooming. It's implied that Callisto's original scarring and eye-loss was due to her being gang-raped by thugs as a young woman, after which the trauma caused her to become homeless and live in the sewers. Her name itself hints at this, being extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">symbolic</a>, as it was taken from the Greek myth of the most beautiful Nymph of Greece who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">raped</a> by the god Zeus (who is of course infamous for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepravedBisexual">libido</a>) and thereafter was transformed into a bestial appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> Dr. Ella Whitby, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a>'s one-time prison psychiatrist. She's referred to by several characters as fat and/or ugly (including Deadpool, who at one point had a crush on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeaArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BeaArthur">Bea Arthur</a>, but finds Dr. Whitby revolting). In actuality, she's fairly pretty and barely 20 lbs. heavier than anyone else. Also, another patient, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Foolkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Foolkiller">Foolkiller</a>, is actually madly attracted to her but his feelings go unreciprocated. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She may have been predetermined by the writers to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableHardLuckTargets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableHardLuckTargets">Acceptable Hard Luck Target</a> since she turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">Harley Quinn</a> style.</span>
<ul><li> Wade Wilson aka <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deadpool">Deadpool</a> himself is a victim of this. Once conventionally attractive like all the other average comic-book leading men, he became ugly due to an experimental cancer treatment that saved his life and gave him superpowers but made him look like Freddy Krueger. Being ugly is a big part of his character, and one of the things that he's very insecure about. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist">Depending on the Artist</a>, he can actually look the part, and be very repulsive.

His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> also heals his cancer and spreads it to every cell of his body, yet at the same time heals the damage done by the cancer. So his skin is constantly changing rather than permanently scarred, meaning that sometimes it looks much worse than others.

Not a truly straight example, because her inner circle (her boyfriend, her best friend, and the caged eldritch being from another dimension that lives on her coffee table) don't think she's fat (well, what Demonwolf says implies he does think she has a bigger-than-average butt, but he also seems to be kind of into that and phrases it in generally positive terms), and even most of the people who insult her seem to covertly find her attractive (the male ones, at least)... they're just insulting her because they're jerks.

Frankly, this "freak" looks like a god that descended from Mount Olympus, even more so than Superman. Most people would consider themselves quite fortunate to be half as "hideous" as H'el.

</li><li> In a similar vein, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EveArden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EveArden">Eve Arden</a> was often cast as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDateless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodDateless">Hollywood Dateless</a> best friend. Even at the time, critics couldn't quite buy it.
<div class="indent"> "Why is it that she, strikingly attractive, wittier and more human than other females in her pictures, is always pictured as lonely, unwanted and unsung? In real life, I'm sure Eve is the belle of the ball."

And while her act-crazy-for-attention behavior might be off-putting, a lot of people would argue that she doesn't actually look bad. Many viewers preferred her stylish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Goth">gothic</a> pre- makeover look (messy hair, heavy eyeliner, dark thrift shop clothes) over her generically pretty post-makeover one —<em>including</em> the actress herself, Ally Sheedy. In Sheedy's defense this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>: Sheedy herself has stated that her career suffered because she was often considered "not sexy enough" at the time:

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeKindRewind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeKindRewind">Be Kind Rewind</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelonieDiaz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MelonieDiaz">Melonie Diaz</a>'s character, Alma, is played up as ugly when the male filmmakers are forced to take her over her more attractive sister. They achieve this by... having her sniff and rub her nose a couple of times. It's quickly forgotten and she's the hot girl for the rest of the movie. Especially egregious as she had just starred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGuideToRecognizingYourSaints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AGuideToRecognizingYourSaints">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a></em> playing the neighborhood hottie.
</li><li> The film adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beastly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Beastly">Beastly</a></em> has several examples:
<ul><li> Lindy is supposed to be a Plain Jane who would rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookWorm">focus on books and her classwork</a> than looking pretty. The movie version casts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanessaHudgens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/VanessaHudgens">Vanessa Hudgens</a> in the role, and "uglifies" her with messy hair, bangs, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GranolaGirl">boho</a> wardrobe. Apart from being a bit less polished, she looks no different than the "hot" popular girls.
</li><li> The witch, Kendra, is described as overweight and hideous, with bad teeth and skin, a hooked nose, green hair, and ratty black clothes (i.e. like a traditional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WickedWitch">Wicked Witch</a>). In the film, Kendra is...a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodPudgy">slightly-plump</a> Mary-Kate Olsen with bleached eyebrows, a ghostly complexion, heavy makeup (with the odd facial piercing and tattoo), and (fashionably) eccentric hairstyles and outfits. She looks like a Gothic runway model, but the popular students still treat her as if she's hideous (with Kyle calling her a "self-mutilated, tattooed Frankenskank").
</li><li> The same goes for any of the other "ugly" students Kyle puts down during his campaign rally. None of them are even below average appearance-wise, but he still them as if they're hideously disfigured. Of particular note is a shy boy whom Kyle says has "a face like a burnt Lego".
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2011/02/28">Then there is the beast himself.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> In the book, he's turned into an <em>actual</em> beast (fur, fangs, etcetera). In the movie, he just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">loses his hair and gets a lot of tattoos and scars</a>. Not ideal, but nowhere near as bad as being a literal monster. The way he reacts to this more realistic appearance (coupled with the way he treats average-looking and marginally attractive people) adds a lot of new implications about his character.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">Carrie</a></em>:
<ul><li> The book's first two adaptations manage to skirt around this with the titular character; in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie1976" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie1976">the original</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SissySpacek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SissySpacek">Sissy Spacek</a>'s character is said that she would look nicer if she made an effort, as demonstrated at the prom. And <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2002">the 2002 remake</a> has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaBettis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AngelaBettis">Angela Bettis</a> go down the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyInversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeautyInversion">Beauty Inversion</a> route to be believable as an outcast. But the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2013">2013 version</a> casts the beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChloeMoretz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChloeMoretz">Chloë Moretz</a> as Carrie. Even if her hair is messed up, it's still fashionably layered with perfect highlights. She does at least work hard to make Carrie's attitude believable for a socially awkward girl.
</li><li> Spacek herself was nearly cast as one of the pretty, popular girls (even though did well reading for the part of Carrie White) because the director thought she was too attractive to be believable as a high school outcast. Spacek showed up for her second reading in a homemade dress, with her face and hair unwashed, and mumbled her way through her lines. The rest is history.

At the start she's meant to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasQuiteALooker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWasQuiteALooker">past her prime</a>, yet is played by 60s and 70s sex symbol <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridPitt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IngridPitt">Ingrid Pitt</a> in old age make-up and a matronly dress to hide her figure. Once the blood has its effect, Ingrid Pitt just looks like herself and showcases her beauty. They do however have her becoming more deformed each time she snaps back into her older self.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalDestination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalDestination">Final Destination</a></em> often seems to do this with its heroines.
<ul><li> The first film's female lead is Clear Rivers - who's meant to be a loner that Alex wouldn't have noticed until the disaster bonded them. As she was played by late 90s/early 2000s super hottie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AliLarter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AliLarter">Ali Larter</a>, her blonde hair is dyed brown and cut into an unflattering fringe, and she's given baggy clothes to suit her 'weird artist' persona.
</li><li> The second film likewise has AJ Cook as the plainer girl in her group of friends - in contrast to her more outgoing and vampy friend Sheena. AJ Cook likewise dyes her hair dark brown and wears modest coats and cardigans for most of the film.
</li><li> The third film's script describes the protagonist Wendy as "pretty but not the most attractive girl in school". They cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryElizabethWinstead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryElizabethWinstead">Mary Elizabeth Winstead</a> and her hair is lightly tousled.

Because of this the character, despite being slightly overweight and frequently making grotesque faces, is still attractive. The trope is somewhat justified in that Georgy's insecurity and social awkwardness make her seem less attractive than she actually is.
</li><li> Charlotte Gainsbourg has made a career out of this trope, playing specifically unattractive characters in some of her biggest roles:
<ul><li> She plays the title character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em>, whose plainness is a major aspect of her character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScienceOfSleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScienceOfSleep">The Science of Sleep</a></em> she plays the plain woman whom the main character initially ignores in favor of her more attractive roommate.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyOneGrams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyOneGrams">21 Grams</a></em>, she plays a cuckolded wife whose sick husband acquires a more attractive mistress.

Though Migure's Peter Paker still acts awkward even when he's Spider-Man, which differs from the comic where he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IShallTauntYou">quip happy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrillSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrillSeeker">Thrill Seeker</a>.

She's depicted as such a "droop" that at one point Andy has to pay his chums to dance with her at a school prom. She's also played by Donna Reed.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogfight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dogfight">Dogfight</a></em>, starring River Phoenix and Lili Taylor, is about a crew of Marines who challenge each other to a 'dogfight' — finding the ugliest girl they can and bringing her to a party. Phoenix's character selects Taylor's character in order to win this 'dogfight'. By Hollywood standards, she's <em>hideous</em>. By any real-world standards, she's reasonably attractive.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEnchantedCottage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEnchantedCottage">The Enchanted Cottage</a></em>: The main woman is so "homely" that no guys will dance with her, young boys comment on her looks, and she generally limits her social life in despair. Later, a man breaks off with his fiancée and considers suicide over a barely visible war scar. As the two fall in love, they become beautiful in each other's eyes — represented on camera by a strange blur on their features.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>: Hermione Granger is a source of debate amongst fans.

The films have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmmaWatson">Emma Watson</a>, who starts out cute and, as she ages, becomes positively stunning in the role. In-universe the books are in Harry's perspective, and he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeBrotherAndSister">simply doesn't see Hermione like that</a>; the only one who outright says she's ugly is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> Pansy Parkinson. (Parkinson herself is described as having a "face like a pug" in the book but is played by a fairly cute actress, who simply has a turned-up nose.) Harry himself says otherwise in later books. It's worth noting that from age 14, Hermione started to attract admirers in Viktor Krum, Cormac McLaggen and of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Ron Weasley</a>. The only time in the movies she was said to not be pretty was when she was referred to as a "homely but ambitious girl" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndTheGobletOfFire">The Goblet of Fire</a></em> film, and that was in an article published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaliciousSlander">Rita Skeeter</a>. JK Rowling has joked that it was lucky she talked to Emma Watson over the phone first - where she apparently spoke for a minute without taking a breath and made the author realise she was perfect for Hermione. When she met the girl in person, she recalls going <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> when she saw how cute she was ("I had to say '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">it's film</a>, so get over it'...").

</li><li> Film adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre">Jane Eyre</a></em> are frequent victims of this trope.

However actresses who have played her on-screen include: <a class="urllink" href="http://www.windowphobe.com/shrine/iw40vb04.jpg">Virginia Bruce<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, <a class="urllink" href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/f4/44/27/f44427578dee92357b1b7d9d708c1f94.jpg">Joan Fontaine<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, Susanna York, <a class="urllink" href="http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/43652/399a5835.jpg">Charlotte Gainsbourg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> and <a class="urllink" href="http://wallpapersboom.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3456_mia_wasikowska.jpg">Mia Wasikowska<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JennifersBody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JennifersBody">Jennifer's Body</a></em> subverts the trope while still exploiting it anyway. The titular Jennifer is the attractive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> and Needy is her "plain Jane" nerdy best friend. Needy is played by the stunning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmandaSeyfried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AmandaSeyfried">Amanda Seyfried</a>. However, it is mentioned that Needy has to dress herself down whenever she's out with Jennifer (she's forbidden from showing any cleavage) - so it seems the latter is aware that Needy is a pretty girl who she doesn't want upstaging her. The director and screenwriter joke on the DVD commentary that only in Hollywood would Amanda Seyfried be cast as the unattractive one.
</li><li> The character Jo March in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleWomen">Little Women</a></em>, meant to be a plain tomboy, has been played by some of Hollywood's most attractive actresses, including Katharine Hepburn, Susan Dey, and Winona Ryder. The likes of Katharine Hepburn (in the 1933 film) and Saoirse Ronan (in 2019) are considered the more apt casting choices as, while very pretty actresses, they are not conventionally so and more believable against more classic beauties as the other sisters.

"Usually" is the key word there, as she is supposed to be the ugly type in this film. They don't really go out of their way to make her "ugly", but merely extremely nerdy and uncaring about her appearance - no makeup, thick glasses, overbite, mousy hair, and unflattering clothes. Once she starts gaining confidence, she works on all these and her beauty shines through.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissCongeniality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissCongeniality">Miss Congeniality</a></em> plays with the trope. Sandra Bullock has to get a makeover to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverModel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndercoverModel">Undercover Model</a>. While she's chosen to go undercover primarily <em>because</em> she looks like she could pass for a pageant contestant, the jaw-dropped reactions of her co-workers and the pageant director still feel a little overblown. The pageant director even mentions that Dennis Rodman looked better in a dress when they first met <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">although that might have been said out of spite for being arrested</span>. It does help that she's shown having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLadette">the table manners of Jabba the Hutt and the charisma of a drunk truck driver</a>, which justifies it further.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyBigFatGreekWedding">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a></em>: While Nia Vardalos is a very pretty woman she is anything but the typical Hollywood bombshell, which many people have stated helped make the film that much more appealing. Her homely look genuinely made her plain, and getting the makeover did <em>wonders.</em>

It's an early example of how to 'do an Ugly Betty'; the film came out in 1942. Bette herself wanted to look even homelier and really have her costumes padded out, but the studio rejected the look for being "too grotesque". However, in a flashback to Charlotte's life at age twenty, she's shown to be quite cute - demonstrating that she's a naturally good-looking woman who's just let herself go. The film likewise downplays the cuteness of child actress Janis Wilson as Jerry's daughter Tina (glasses and messy hair) so that she can have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheCleansUpNicely">She Cleans Up Nicely</a> moment to signal her character development.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReCut">extended edition</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFellowshipOfTheRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFellowshipOfTheRing">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></em> Sam remarks Aragon aka Strider looks foul, true Sam doesnt trust him at that point but foul is a word that does not apply to the obviously <a class="urllink" href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQg41CMMgBVU_p04wwoahLldFa5G0vGbrW4ZXNdAqjHYYj3trHC&amp;usqp=CAU">incredibly handsome and rugged Viggo Mortensen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This probably due to lifting the line from the book where Aragon is described as weatherbeaten and shady looking when he first appears as a ranger and its only later when he symbolically becomes more kingly as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLeader">The Leader</a> that he is described as handsome. In the film hes a looker from the start so Sams line is confusing. It would have been even more egregious with the original actor for Aragorn - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrettyBoy">Pretty Boy</a> Stuart Townsend!
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnlyYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnlyYou">Only You</a></em>, Andrew McCarthy's character has to make a choice between two potential girlfriends, one who is beautiful and one who is supposedly not beautiful but otherwise desirable. The supposedly plain-looking woman is played by Helen Hunt. McCarthy has to face the dilemma of whether he should settle for a woman whose worst flaw is she is only as attractive as Helen Hunt.

While this is used to show Darcy as a jerk, it's made clear older sister Jane is the beauty of the county while Elizabeth is fairly attractive but not stunningly beautiful - words that do not describe Keira Knightley.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1pl0t');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1pl0t" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1pl0t');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">What makes this especially odd is that Keira was nearly turned down for being too glamorous to be Lizzie.</span> It's even worse with Mary. Once they get into their ballgowns, it becomes ridiculous to call her plain or plainer than her sisters. The movie also files off Mary's more unlikeable traits - such as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowNothingKnowItAll">Know-Nothing Know-It-All</a> and anti-social snob.
</li><li> In the miniseries of 1995, the older sister (the pretty one, according to dialogue) is plain compared to Lizzie. This crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>; Susannah Harker, who played Jane, fits the Regency ideal of beauty perfectly, but that ideal has shifted to the point where modern viewers consider Jennifer Ehle more attractive. Additionally, there was a fashion in the Regency period for dark-haired, pale-skinned women, so Jennifer Ehle might have attracted more attention in that era as well.

After scanning the whole school, they settle on the obviously attractive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RachaelLeighCook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RachaelLeighCook">Rachael Leigh Cook</a> as the least likely to be named prom queen. She just wears glasses and paint-colored overalls - not to mention being a bit of a Klutz.

The film does at least make an attempt to address this by having the character point out that the reason Rachael Leigh Cook would be a hard sell for prom queen is not so much her looks as her scary and inaccessible personality.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleepover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sleepover">Sleepover</a></em>, the lead female runs into a "ticket girl" who couldn't go into the prom because she has never been able to get a date.

Before that, it is just the very attractive Jenna Dewan with no make-up on and unflattering clothing. The first time we see her in the movie, she's having a dream about what she would be like if she were attractive, demonstrating the fact that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imnotobsessed.com/2012/09/17/channing-and-jenna-dewan-tatum-step-out-in-style/#.UMcjjoPAeSo">Dewan is an absolute knockout.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> It makes the attempts to present her as "ugly" afterward laughable.

By the end of the film, she's able to snag the hot delivery man who always flirts with her, with a little help from Elle. Keep in mind, this is the same actress who helped coin the term "MILF" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie">American Pie</a></em>.

</li><li> V. in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola">Francis Ford Coppola's</a> <em>Twixt</em>, to an extent. She comments that other kids mock her for her overbite; aside from said overbite and her wearing braces (both of which are barely noticeable), the film does nothing to deter from the fact that she's played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleFanning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElleFanning">Elle Fanning</a>.
</li><li> The entire premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDUFF" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDUFF">The DUFF</a></em> hinges on the notion that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeWhitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaeWhitman">Mae Whitman</a> could pass for a "Designated Ugly Fat Friend", just because she's slightly huskier than the other leading female character. Though it's made clear that you don't have to be ugly or fat to count as such. Still, it's emphasized that she's unpopular because she's awkward and shy and has "unpopular tastes," but even then, someone as attractive as Whitman makes awkwardness much more charming and endearing, and her "strange tastes" (liking old or obscure movies) aren't really that strange or unpopular enough to warrant anyone running for the hills. A lot of her status also relies on the fact that her friends are more 'traditional' in terms of personality and beauty, and people would rather use her as a stepping stone to get to them.
</li><li> Mary Bee Cuddy, the frontier spinster heroine of <em>The Homesman</em> played by Hilary Swank. Two men refuse to marry her, partly because she's too "plain." While not movie-star gorgeous, she's an average nice-looking woman, not unattractive by real-world standards. (However, in both the movie and the novel, it seems likely that their primary reason for rejecting her is the other one they give, that she's "bossy.")
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FiveHundredDaysOfSummer">(500) Days of Summer</a></em> has one random guy react with shock that Summer is dating Tom. He's played by Joseph Gordon Levitt, who was a teen heartthrob for years. He's given baggy clothes and hair in his eyes, and the rest of the characters state that Summer is out of his league.
</li><li> The most egregious example comes from the 1960 film <em>Where the Boys Are</em> where <a class="urllink" href="http://www.mfwright.com/CFphotogallery/connie269.jpg">Connie Francis's character<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> is supposed to have a hard time finding a date that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsAnAmazon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoGuyWantsAnAmazon">isn't intimidated by her athletic abilities</a> and is supposed to be overall unattractive, with the actress involved, it's hard to take it at face value.

She's played by Elisabeth Shue, who is quite attractive.

Her actress? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SigourneyWeaver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SigourneyWeaver">Sigourney Weaver</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpectacularNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheSpectacularNow">The Spectacular Now</a></em> plays with this. Sutter's best friend reacts with shock that he's choosing to date Aimee Finicky. While she's a shy geek girl, she's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShaileneWoodley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ShaileneWoodley">Shailene Woodley</a>. Shailene notably insisted on not wearing make-up for the role - feeling Aimee wouldn't - but she's still a cutie. Sutter even says that two guys were checking her out at the first party he takes her to. When she dolls up for the prom near the end, she's just as gorgeous as any other girl in the film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy">Vampire Academy</a></em> - Natalie Dashkov is a very shy, awkward gawky vampire nerd girl who hangs out with the heroines. In the movie, she's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahHyland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SarahHyland">Sarah Hyland</a></em> in glasses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MeanGirls">Mean Girls</a></em>:
<ul><li> The film straddles the line with Janis. She's supposed to be an 'art freak' and considered unpopular, despite being played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LizzyCaplan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LizzyCaplan">Lizzy Caplan</a>. Producers even came close to turning her down, finding her too beautiful for the character. As she was the best audition, they opted to instead give her an alternative/goth appearance rather than dressing her down. There is a big fan theory that Janis is, in fact, a former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> who got betrayed by Regina the same way Cady plans to do to the latter - and Lizzy Caplan's beauty is a contributing factor.
</li><li> Subverted with Gretchen. She was originally written to be an unattractive girl who was only in the Plastics due to her father's wealth. This was dropped and she was played by the very pretty Lacey Chabert. There are remnants of this in how Damian has to rig the voting to get her nominated for Spring Fling Queen and Regina does say that Gretchen isn't pretty - but in this case, it comes across more as cattiness on Regina's part than Gretchen being considered unattractive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heartbreakers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heartbreakers">Heartbreakers</a></em> has Paige react with disgust that her mother liked Dean, claiming she has to be in serious denial when she says "Dean was kind of cute". You'd think <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayLiotta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayLiotta">Ray Liotta</a> was a hunchbacked leper from how she goes on about him.
</li><li> The portrayal of Eunice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsUpDoc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatsUpDoc">What's Up, Doc?</a></em> combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>. Despite being played by Madeline Khan, she's the target of multiple ugly jokes in the film, mainly from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarbraStreisand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BarbraStreisand">Barbra Streisand</a>'s character of Judy. This along with Eunice being supposedly a needy, high-maintenance shrew is supposed to make the audience want Howard to end up with Judy despite Judy being an obsessive troublemaking stalker who brings chaos wherever she shows up.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GuardiansOfTheGalaxyVol2">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a></em>. Drax and Mantis are both pretty good looking, but their species have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">different standards of beauty</a> and as a result, they find each other physically repulsive, even after they become close friends. When Drax is made to imagine them being in a sexual relationship, he comes startlingly close to vomiting. And during the ending, they have this exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Mantis:</strong> It's beautiful. <br/><strong>Drax:</strong> Yes it is. And so are you. <br/><em>[beat]</em> <br/><strong>Drax:</strong> On the inside.
</div></li><li> Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptationalAttractiveness">Adaptational Attractiveness</a>, this is the case with Samantha, a.k.a.

In the book, she has a dark red birthmark over the right side of her face, which she has a great deal of insecurity over. In the movie, the birthmark is much smaller, covering a small part of her forehead and her right eye, which she keeps hidden behind her hair. Moreover, she's played by the beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaCooke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OliviaCooke">Olivia Cooke</a>. Naturally, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HonestTrailers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/HonestTrailers">Honest Trailers</a></em> had a field day with this, with the Narrator making a reaction of exaggerated disgust upon seeing her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Polar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Polar">Polar</a></em>: Vanessa Hudgens' stunning looks are downplayed a lot by dressing her in baggy clothes and not having her put on any make-up. This makes sense from an in-story perspective since her character is reeling from past trauma.

</li><li> <em>Blended</em>: Hilary Freidman, due to being raised by her widower father, has no fashion sense and is unattractive to the point of being confused for a boy and being nicknamed Larry. The problem is that Hilary is played by the feminine and beautiful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne">Bella Thorne</a>. They try to make her less attractive via an unflattering haircut and clothes, but it doesn't really work. When Hilary gets a makeover, she literally just looks like Bella normally does.
</li><li> The '50s educational short film <em>Body Care and Grooming</em> tries to make the point that you're more attractive if you bathe regularly and wear presentable clothes... but the opening scene absurdly claims an attractive actress is <em>repulsive to men</em> because her hair's unkempt and her clothes haven't been ironed.

So she washed off her make-up and auditioned again, and won the part. For the duration of filming (eight weeks) she resorted to <em>not showering</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonstersBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MonstersBall">Monster's Ball</a></em> just gives her an unflattering haircut and light make-up, and it was enough to put her on <em>Hollywood's Ten Best Beauty to Beast Transformations</em> (in comparison to Charlize Theron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monster">Monster</a></em>).

Then after she becomes Catwoman she gives herself a makeover, and the movie stops pretending she's anything other than stunning.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Limitless">Limitless</a></em> tries to present Bradley Cooper as a loser before he takes the drug by giving him a messy ponytail that he cuts off in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeoverMontage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeoverMontage">Makeover Montage</a> to look like himself.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhileYouWereSleeping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhileYouWereSleeping">While You Were Sleeping</a></em> presents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraBullock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SandraBullock">Sandra Bullock</a> of all people as a shy, mousey Chicago transportation employee who seems to have few friends or loved ones. Perhaps invoked, since her character's primary problem in the movie is less physical attractiveness and more self-esteem; her 'unattractiveness' mainly comes from her character's tendency to wear unflattering and oversized clothing that reflects her general lack of confidence in herself.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></em>. The plot is kicked off when a beautiful prostitute named Delilah is attacked and cut up by an angry client. Her coworkers put out a bounty for her attacker and wail to everyone who will listen about how she was mutilated and disfigured, even claiming her breasts were sawed off. Then we see Delilah in person and her injuries amount to a few small, superficial scratches on her face that haven't completely healed yet. Turns out, the brothel can't actually afford to pay what they're offering; they were just trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">make an example of the client</a> for assaulting an employee, and they wildly exaggerated Delilah's wounds in the hope that any bounty hunters would be driven enough by moral outrage to kill him <em>before</em> asking for payment.

<ul><li> <em>A Nameless Witch</em> by A. Lee Martinez parodies this:

I cupped the large, fatty mounds on my chest. <br/>"Those are breasts," Ghastly Edna said. "They're supposed to be there." <br/>"But they're so...so..." <br/>"Round. Firm." She sighed.

</li><li> A perennial favorite of tabloid magazines is to show candid photos of starlets not wearing makeup.

</li><li> Nerdanel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em> is described as homely, but this is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">an Elf</a>.

She's not as much portrayed as unattractive as she is unappealing and undateable. It's suggested she is a woman whose life is out of order, wears inappropriate clothing, eats horribly, works too much and doesn't get enough sleep. The people who call her ugly are Jenna (who is crazy and jealous), Jack (who usually just points out her horrible choices) and Jack's associates (who have extremely high standards and are rich person mean). This portrayal could instead be the result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableExpositor">Unreliable Expositors</a>, given that she surrounds herself with horribly vain, manipulative people, and is ordinary only in comparison.

<ul><li> The fact that Peter and Jan tend to be more socially awkward than Greg and Marcia is the only way that episodes like "The Not So Ugly Duckling" or "Cyrano de Brady" are plausible; the general consensus amongst viewers is that the middle children were actually the best-looking of the Brady kids. Over the course of the series they went through visible pubescent awkward stages and in the last season they were so clearly attractive that the writers gave in and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">reversed course</a>. These episodes focused on Peter juggling a date with two girls on the same night and Jan ran for "Most Popular Girl" at school, and won.
</li><li> Greg and Marcia also deal with this trope (indirectly). In the late third-season episode "My Fair Opponent," Marcia plays the sympathetic friend when an awkward and butt-ugly classmate named Molly is nominated (as a cruel joke) for hostess of Filmore Junior High's Banquet Night ... only for the makeover to work out too well and Molly becomes an insufferable snob. Greg's instance (in Season 5's "Peter and the Wolf") is averted: He merely is led to believe, based on old photographs and memories of his girlfriend, that his girlfriend's cousin still wears pigtails and braces and is horribly undesirable; the cousin turns out to be a total hottie.

By the end of Season 1, pretty much everyone has caught on to the fact that she looks like a real-life Disney princess, and her lack of romantic success is attributed instead to her relative youth and naivete compared to the guys she tends to fall for. Season 2 attempts, belatedly, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justify</a> the earlier use of this trope, with Annie explaining that post-rehab she has lost a lot of weight, has better skin, and has dropped a lot of less-appealing character tics. This does explain why Troy initially fails to recognise her despite them having attended school together for years (and why he might be less than thrilled that she had a crush on him), though it's still a mystery why the rest of the study group (who'd only just met her and had no idea what she looked like before) also found her unattractive to begin with.

In fact, the character is played by a beautiful woman wearing a minimal amount of make-up and wearing average clothes with her hair in a pony-tail. There isn't even any of the usual Hollywood Homely attempts to disguise this: she doesn't wear glasses, have braces, wear hideous clothes, have bad hair, or prosthetic makeup.

George rejects attractive women for the position of secretary but Ada is not much more unattractive despite the implication.
<ul><li> George himself could be this trope to many viewers as well, his lack of attractiveness having more to do with his height, glasses, baldness and neuroses.

One personal trainer even stated that most of the women could have just been given a good gym program, a trip to the salon and tips on what clothes would be flattering - as opposed to multiple cosmetic surgeries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTudors">The Tudors</a></em>:
<ul><li> In Season 3, Joss Stone appears as Anne of Cleves. Henry VIII claims he cannot tell her from his horse (which speaks either very poorly of his eyesight or very well of his horse) and is unable to consummate his marriage to her because she is so ugly. This is based on something Henry historically said, but contemporary reports suggest that she was quite pretty. An alternative explanation suggested by other characters is that he's turned off because Anne is a virgin who doesn't know what to do. We also know that Henry was almost 50 years old and as heavy as 400 pounds, so he may have had performance anxiety of his own. Either way, it's most likely all in his head.
</li><li> This is used in Philippa Gregory's novel, <em>The Boleyn Inheritance</em>, where Anne of Cleves seems very frumpy at first because she is wearing modest (read: baggy) and unflattering clothing that she brought with her from Germany. After Henry VIII divorced her, she was free to wear English clothing and hold her own court in her own household. The next time she showed up at court, everyone thought that she looked very pretty. There are several historical accounts that support this theory. Henry slept with her in Season Four.
</li><li> A case can also be made for Henry himself in his later age. King Henry was a fit and athletic man in his youth, and even still is given an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HistoricalBeautyUpdate">Historical Beauty Update</a> with the casting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers. In his later years, Henry is plagued by age, injury, illness and obesity, but he's still played by the same actor with only minor cosmetic changes.
</li><li> A similar case happened with the portrayal of the Emperor Charles V, who appears in The Tudors with the huge Hapsburg chin and all (even though <a class="urllink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0273797/">the actor Sebastian Armesto is quite handsome without the prosthetic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), compared to Charles V's portrayal in "Carlos, Rey Emperador", where he's <a class="urllink" href="http://images.vertele.eldiario.es/2015/12/03/noticias/carlos-rey-emperador-VEINTE_1744335663_8040530_660x371.jpg">remarkably more handsome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> than any painting of his historical counterpart, and receives the same ageing process than Jonathan Rhys Meyers by the end of the series.

When the wrappings around her head are removed, she looks the pinnacle of beauty (at least according to the fashion at the time of this episode's production) but is horribly upset she's still hideous. The faces of the other people around the hospital are then revealed, which appear grotesque and inhuman but are deemed normal to attractive by the standards of their world. The episode sends <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">the message</a> that human perceptions of beauty and ugliness are created through observation of other people.

The idea is that she's working at a fashion magazine, which has a very high and conventional standard of beauty. It's not that Betty is ugly, she's just not made up like a model. Indeed, season four has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DreamSequence">Dream Sequence</a> in which Betty is "beautiful," but the beautiful version is just America Ferrera without her "ugly" accessories.

WWE were clearly hoping to recreate the 'beast vs beauty' feud they'd had in the past with the likes of Jazz vs Trish Stratus, Bull Nakano vs Alundra Blayze etc. Except Beth was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">Amazonian Beauty</a> and presented as such beforehand (her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">Red Baron</a> was 'The Glamazon') who had provided plenty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a> in Diva photoshoots as well.

Fosca is <em>supposed</em> to be ugly — that's the entire point of her character — but whenever they used prosthetics to make the actress Donna Murphy look genuinely ugly, the audience lost all sympathy for the character. They ended up making Murphy up in pale "no make-up" make-up, giving her a mole, and dressing her in unflattering clothes; that was as much ugliness as the audience could take. Lest tropers unfamiliar with the work think poorly of those audiences, the character of Fosca isn't beautiful on the inside, either—she has deep psychological scars from a disastrous first marriage and spends most of the show pursuing a man who has clearly and calmly indicated that 1. He's not interested and 2. He's already in a relationship (with a married woman but still...). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he finally reciprocates at the end, it's not clear if he has learned to love her or if she has simply broken him.</span>

Will Powers, the defendant in the third case, is genuinely rough-looking and unattractive. Maya, who has never seen him out of his Steel Samurai costume, is more than a little stunned. There are many who find Will's cragginess rather appealing, and the constant hullabaloo about how "frightening" he looks a straight invocation of this trope.
</li><li> The sequel has some more good times on this subject: Will, who lacks the skills or training for anything but television, has been reduced to hosting a children's exercise program in a rabbit costume that hides his face, Will's successor, Matt Engarde, usually looks about as attractively sixteen as you can get (until <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he pushes back his hair and reveals the extreme scar across his eye, which also signals his switch into his real personality as an inhuman, manipulative monster</span>), and Matt's supposed rival, Juan Corrida, is frequently mocked for being ugly and looking so much older than Matt (i.e. he looks to be in his early-to-mid twenties, which he is, and he looks pretty good for it too).

No-one in the series ever explicitly states that she is unattractive <em>but</em> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooMysteryInc">Scooby-Doo!

A flashback to the audition provides this exchange:
<div class="indent"><strong>Producer:</strong> What were you thinking? <br/><strong>Casting:</strong> Well, you said you wanted gritty. In other words, ugly. <br/><strong>Producer:</strong> I wanted Mary Ann on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland">Gilligan's Island</a></em> ugly, not Cornelius on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a></em> ugly.

</div></li><li> Jay Sherman on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCritic">The Critic</a></em> appears mildly overweight, balding, and short to viewers, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> he appears to resemble a disgusting animal to everyone around him.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>; at first Blackarachnias hideousness comes off like an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute">Informed Attribute</a> and a poor self-image on her part. Then her helmet gets knocked off and we learn her armor is mostly there to hide her <em>very real</em> deformities; the only part of her head that still looks normal is her mouth. The rest is best described as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">a gnarled mass of spikes and eyes</a>.
</li><li> As usual, played with in the "Fractured Fairy Tales" segment "The Ugly Duckling" on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em>. The titular duck goes to Hollywood, hoping to become an actor, but is rejected for his ugliness. He gets plastic surgery and becomes quite handsome. However, he learns to trend is now towards monster movies, so the studios <em>want</em> ugly ducklings. The segment ends with the now-attractive duck getting pummeled with baseballs at a carnival game, determined to get ugly again and be a star.
