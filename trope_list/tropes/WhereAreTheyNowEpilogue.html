<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AssassinationClassroom">Assassination Classroom</a></em>: In two phases, covering Chapters 179-180:
<ul><li> The first half of Chapter 179 focuses on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the immediate aftermath of Koro-sensei's death at the hands of Class 3-E. Shiro/Yanagisawa survives being blown away into the anti-tentacle barrier, but the damage to his tentacle-infused body has left him a vegetable, while his experiments have been finally canned by the government. Public outrage over revelations of Kunugigaoka's discriminatory policies forced Asano Sr. to step down, though he not only seems to have anticipated it, but also sees it as an opportunity to start anew. Class 3-E used part of their reward to support their later education, donate to some acquaintances, and buy the entire mountain they used to call their classroom, while the rest was returned to the government.</span>
</li><li> The latter half of Chapter 179 and the entirety of Chapter 180 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">fast-forwards to seven years later</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The moon has collapsed and coalesced again into a spherical form while it was pulled closer by Earth's gravity, implicitly normalizing the tides to pre-explosion levels. Karasuma and Irina are now married and work together as counterterrorist agents. And by the looks of it, Class 3-E's alumni have utilized everything they learned to lead successful and meaningful lives — Ritsu is now a fully-sentient being, Okano the leader of a university athletics club (which uses her old turf as training grounds), Kurahashi an ecotourist guide (using the same mountain for explorations), Takebayashi and Okuda developers of universal artificial blood, Sugino a college baseball superstar, Terasaka an apprentice to a powerful politician, Yoshida, Muramatsu and Itona inheritors to their family businesses, Nakamura a university student in London, Hazama a librarian, Kanzaki a caregiver, Sugaya an experimental artist, Karma an aspiring statesman, Kayano has returned to showbiz and is currently starring in a popular drama, and Nagisa is now teacher to a class of delinquents, while the rest are implied to be most likely finishing their education and starting new careers as well — even as they never forget to keep in contact with each other.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The last half of episode 11 in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile">Nodame Cantabile</a></em> Finale where it shows under the credits and the ending theme where everyone is going. Also, a case of All Love is Requited.
</li><li> The last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ElHazardTheMagnificentWorld">El-Hazard: The Magnificent World</a></em> ran pastel drawings under its closing credits that showed obvious "after the series" images — Makoto and Ifurita snuggling under a tree, Allielle in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joshikousei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joshikousei">seifuku</a></em>, and so on. They may simply be non-canon art pieces, however.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaAs">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's</a></em> did this in the end, skipping the series forward six years, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorlyDisguisedPilot">leaving only four more before the new season</a>.
<ul><li> The following season, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers">Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS</a></em>, did the same thing, though it didn't skip forward as far.
</li></ul></li><li> The manga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PleaseSaveMyEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PleaseSaveMyEarth">Please Save My Earth</a></em> closed with a scene showing the seven protagonists settling into their new lives several years later, as well as the circumstances of the spirits of the main couple.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Last five minutes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>, specifically the shots that show us what the digidestined's careers are, now that they've grown up.
</li><li> Also used sort of at the end of the fourth movie (2nd in English due to the combining of the first three as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonTheMovie">Digimon: The Movie</a></em>). While the credits are on we see stills of what the characters got up to more or less directly after the film.
</li><li> Last five minutes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonSavers">Digimon Savers</a></em> (5 years later, and less controversial...yeah).

The epilogue is narrated by Marie, the youngest member of the cast, now a fetching girl of about 18 or so.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Canvas2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Canvas2">Canvas 2</a></em> has one of these, including a scene which subverts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Tomoko</a>'s prior supposed death a couple of minutes before</span>.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlueDrop">Blue Drop</a></em> shows Michiko on her way to a peace talk with the aliens, thirty years after her experiences with Hagino and Mari, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">still holding a copy of the script of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay">School Play</a> she wrote and which Hagino wanted to finish playing</span>.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Monster">Monster</a></em> shows Doctor Tenma coming back to Germany to see Nina and Dieter, having joined Doctors Without Borders. It also shows Johan in a coma... until the ending credits reveal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequelHook">an empty bed</a>. Previously, it shows that Eva overcomes her problems, Dieter lives happily with Dr. Reichwein, Nina is being successful in her laws degree and Lunge fixes his relationship with his daughter.
</li><li> The end of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry">Higurashi: When They Cry</a></em> uses this, with what looks like the main cast all enjoying themselves after Keiichi managed to save Rena. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The reader is treated to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">stinger</a> in which everyone has <em>still</em> died and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop">"Groundhog Day" Loop</a> has -once again- begun anew.</span>
<ul><li> Look at the ending again. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That isn't even the same world. Ooishi acts like Miyo died last night and told Rika. He told Rena before and that happened days before.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The final scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OutlawStar">Outlaw Star</a></em> shows the crew saying their goodbyes and going their separate ways. But wait: in the post-credit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger">stinger</a>, surprise, surprise, they all get back together again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWingEndlessWaltz">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz</a></em> ended with a dialogue-free ending credits sequence that demonstrated what each character did almost immediately following. The extended movie version had completely new sequences that remained dialogue-free, but was a bit more elaborate in what it presented.
<ul><li> Most notably including <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lady Une taking Mariemaia to her "father's" gravestone</span> (though the man in question didn't really leave a body to put in a tomb).
</li></ul></li><li> The final page/episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> depicts a collage of photographs to show what the characters are up to several years after the finale, including Ed, Al, and Winry finding ways to use Al's armor to help people.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">The 2003 anime version</a> does something like this, the last half of the episode showing what everyone's up to after the fallout. That is, until the movie picks up right where the epilogue leaves off at. Whoops.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ARIA">Aria</a></em>, Akari explains in a letter to Ai what is going on with several characters, apparently a few years after she took over Aria Company. At the very end there is an even bigger time-skip, showing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ai as Akari's new apprentice</span>.
<ul><li> In the manga, Akari's letter is not to Ai, but to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the readers of her blog, which include Cait Sith</span>, although the timeskip event is still the same.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> ends with one of these. The funniest is that Jeremiah, who had been tormented by the derisive name "Orange", ends up accepting the name and living <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyEverAfter">Happily Ever After</a> <em>growing oranges</em>!
</li><li> A few examples from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a></em>.
<ul><li> The credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">My Neighbor Totoro</a></em> show incidents from the future, starting with the mother's return from the hospital.
</li><li> Similarly, the credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KikisDeliveryService">Kiki's Delivery Service</a></em> show what happened with Tombo's aviator's club, Jiji and Lily, ect.
</li><li> The credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NausicaaOfTheValleyOfTheWind">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a></em> show Nausicaa reuniting with her people, Kushana and the Torumekian army leaving the valley peacefully, and Lord Yupa and Asbel exploring the toxic jungle together.

Smokey goes to college, majors in political science, and becomes the first black mayor in his home state of Georgia. Stroheim never sees Joseph again after the battle against Kars, and eventually falls during the battle of Stalingrad, a proud German solider till the end. Jump to 1989, Joseph, now in his 60s, boards a plane to visit his daughter and grandson in Japan, setting up the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>.

The epilogue was <em>not</em> released in the magazine <em>Chrono Crusade</em> ran in, meaning that fans had to wait for the book to come out to get a clearer idea of what happened after the finale.
</li><li> The ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em> does this, showing the three protagonists walking along their individual paths after splitting up and enjoying the scenery while the credits play.

<ul><li> Turns out Masamune kind of won (Yukimura was being distracted), but didn't get round to finishing the job before a <em>new</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> showed up.

A montage of events that occur over approximately three and a half months—particularly Miaka's transition to high school—and then we see Miaka and Yui in high school (complete with montage-filled credits). Keisuke and Tetsuya then set them up with Tamahome's reincarnation, Taka Sukunami—or not, depending on which version you accept, and... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CliffHanger">Cliffhanger</a>!
<ul><li> The last few pages of volume 18 (which is the manga form of the second OVA) shows few pictures of the Suzaku Seishi after their rebirth. Nuriko seems to have gotten his wish of being reborn as a girl so "he" could be there for Hotohori, Mitsukake is studying herbs with Shouka, who is the reborn version of his girlfriend, Tasuki returned back to his bandit life. Even the cat Tama started a family! Chichiri is also shown, but we don't know if he used Mitsukake's holy water to cure his destroyed left eye. Miaka and Tamahome/Taka are happily married with a toddler aged son.

<ul><li> Also, all of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> movies end with scenes showing what Ash Ketchum, Pikachu, and his friends are doing following the films' events along with certain characters from previous movies such as:
<ul><li> In <em>Lucario and the Mystery of Mew</em> when Kidd appears to be exploring Forina, we see Butler and Diane from <em>Jirachi: Wish Maker</em>, having apparently started a farm together.
</li><li> In <em>Arceus and the Jewel of Life</em>, we see Tonio and Alice from <em>The Rise of Darkrai</em> enjoying a date in a hot air balloon while Baron Alberto attempts to follow them. Darkrai is then seen looking over the town. Then later we see Zero, the villain from <em>Giratina and the Sky Warrior</em> in prison, only to be visited by Newton Graceland who gives him a copy of Infi that survived the Megarig's wreck, much to his delight. Shaymin is also seen, looking out to a sunrise with a smile.

</li><li> The second half of the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em> took place months after Godai and Kyoko's wedding and illustrated how the lives of the various characters continued on in the months since: Akemi has married the owner of ChaChaMaru and moved out of Ikkoku, Kozue is living in Nagoya with her husband, Ibuki is attending an all women's college, Mitaka and Asuna are raising twins, with more on the way... and Godai and Kyoko come back to Ikkoku from the hospital with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">baby in tow.</a>
</li><li> The Japanese version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a>: Duel Monsters</em> has one in the final episode showing the credits montage of the characters returning home and the whereabouts of minor characters.
</li><li> The extra ending in the final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula">Future GPX Cyber Formula</a> SIN</em> takes place one year after the 2022 racing season, a new racing season opens with some of the racers switching teams and new outfits for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitGirls">Pit Girls</a> and ending with the marriage ceremony of the main couple.
</li><li> The last episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun">Simoun</a></em> is one of these as well. Paraietta and Roatreamon run an orphanage together in Mamiina's memory, Kaim and Alty have made up and live together, Floe and Vyura (who both chose to become male) are being drafted on opposite sides of a war, Morinas married Wapourif, has a child (with a second on the way), and works for Wauf, Rimone and Dominura are still in the past establishing the Simoun traditions (and it's implied that they never choose a gender), Yun takes Onasia's place as the leader of Simaulcrum, and Aer and Neviril <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tayutama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tayutama">Tayutama</a> Kiss On My Deity</em> combines this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> in an ending that makes little sense whatsoever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> doesn't have those as an epilogue (since it's still running), but it does have cover story mini-arcs that sometimes act as this, especially the post-timeskip "From the Decks of the World".
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em> anime, the last few minutes before the credits are a version of this. It shows the current antics of most the characters of the Emiya household such as Sakura, Ilya, Rin and Taiga. And then it turns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding">bittersweet</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker">depressing</a> as it shows <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/KingArthur">King Arthur</a>'s, also known as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Saber</a>'s last moments as she dies with her hoping that she'll be able to see Shirou again after her 'long sleep'.
</li><li> Within the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PrettyCure">Pretty Cure</a></em> franchise, while a case of this first used on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartCatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartCatchPrettyCure">Heartcatch</a></em>, it wasn't until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoPrincessPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoPrincessPrettyCure">Go!

<ul><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartCatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartCatchPrettyCure">Heart Catch Pretty Cure</a></em>, the first half of the final episode shows the conclusion of the final battle while the second half shows the group a few months later - they only show the main girls, mostly that Tsubomi is now a proud older sister (and she's gone back to wearing her glasses full time) and Itsuki's finally being a girl, letting her hair grow out and wearing the girl's school uniform. It goes one step further by showing Tsubomi's little sister, standing by Tsubomi's desk, looking at the picture of the Precures and holding Tsubomi's Heart Perfume, hinting that she's next in line to be a Precure.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoPrincessPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoPrincessPrettyCure">Go!

The final scenes, set at an unknown amount of year after the show ended, showed that Yui has completed her book while the Cures got themselves a crystal version of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinkets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinkets">Transformation Trinkets</a>. Interestingly, unlike all the other cases in the franchise, the grown-up versions of the Cures and Yui didn't show up their faces.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahouTsukaiPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MahouTsukaiPrettyCure">Mahou Tsukai Pretty Cure</a></em>'s proper epilogue episode shows that approximately 5 years in the future, Mirai has entered college while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassingTheTorch">Passing the Torch</a> episode reveals that Riko has become a teacher in the Magic World. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Through a miracle, they would have a tearful reunion with Kotoha and Mofurun at the end of the proper epilogue episode.</span>

It showcased that Hana is now a CEO of her own company, Saaya is now a doctor, Homare is now a gold-medalist ice skater, Emiru is full-fledged solo rockstar, while Ruru <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was reunited with Emiru as a newly-created robot unit created by that timeline's Doctor Traum. Meanwhile, the members of the Crisis Corporation have new jobs or are just growing up. The episode ends with Hana giving birth to that timeline's Hagumi.</span>

Lala is now an investigator at Starry Sky Association while Yuni continues her work to restore her home planet with the help of Aiwarn. The rest of the Knotraiders aside from the Ophiuchus Princess have converted their former base into a massive botanical garden. As for the remaining three? Well, they continued to work in relation to each other: Madoka is now the leader of Japan's first manned rocket project (with her dad as the Prime Minister), Hikaru has fulfilled her dream to be an astronaut and has been chosen to be one of the astronauts of said project's first launch, while Elena now works as an official professional translator for the United States government to cover said launch for the worldwide broadcast. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The very final scene suggests that Hikaru is reunited with Fuwa.</span>

Rua is training to be the future Turbo Duel champion while Ruka is studying in university. Crow continued to duel as a professional duelist, while Jack becomes the King of the Ride Ace Dueling league, making him the World King. Akiza is a high-ranking doctor. Yusei decides to stay in New Domino to protect it.

He and Kei are taking things slowly, while Kei is now a full-time employee for the Blue Men. Carol is in college. Al is a famous professor.

Fan reaction to the ending was mixed, not least because of a few important plot points which took place entirely offscreen (Natsumi had another adventure in the Magic World, the twins met some princes and fell in love, Nagi was freed from the Lifemaker), and a number of other characters fans were interested in were simply not mentioned (such as Fate, Fate's girls, and Arika, Negi's mother).

They're mostly lighthearted (such as Maka improving at basketball and Joe finally getting his coffee) and the final seconds show the students together one last time.
</li><li> Five years after the events of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em> manga, Kenshin and Kaoru have married and have a young son, Kenji. Yahiko is the acting instructor of the dojo, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> implies that he and Tsubame eventually become a thing.
<ul><li> Megumi has gone back to Aizu to work as a doctor/search for her family, Sanosuke has left Japan and taken on the role as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDrifter">The Drifter</a>, and Misao and Aoshi are still in the Oniwabanshuu. Saitou was transferred to an unknown police unit in the epilogue of the manga.
</li><li> The non-canon and controversial <em>Reflection</em> OVA takes place presumably 15 to 20 years after the manga, and depicts middle-aged Kenshin and Kaoru, and their teenaged son Kenji has left the dojo to study under Hiko Seijuurou. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kenshin decides to go help out in the first Sino-Japanese war by taking care of people, despite being very ill.

</li><li> The movie version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheyWereEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheyWereEleven">They Were Eleven</a></em> has a very straightforward one, detailing the future careers of the cast after the end of their Cosmo Academy exam.

An extra chapter shows what the rest has been up to in the seven years since the story concluded.
<ul><li> Romio, Juliet and Airu are all politicians now working on reforms to further establish peace between Towa and the West. Hasuki is an actress apprenticed under Juliet's mother Rackdoll. Char is still in line to inherit the West throne. Maru is a banker, Tosa is a soldier and Kohitsuji is a photographer for a magazine (he wanted to do gravure, but he wound up working for a bodybuilding outfit instead). Leon is a teacher at Dahia Academy, Rex a fashion designer, Kochou and Teria continued their respective career choices (as a pharmacist and roboticist, respectively), Cait Sith and Sieber a pediatrician and the nurse assisting him, respectively, Somali became a pro wrestler while Aby (also a politician) looks after their infant daughters, Shuna is a policewoman, Kougi a priest and Ameria a model. All in all, all characters have been pretty well off. ...Well, except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Scott</a>, who became Char's "pet". And he still hasn't gotten over Romio and Juliet getting together.
</li><li> There are a few more snippets in regards to relationships. Kochou gets inspired by the wedding to try to get together with Airu, but is too shy to make a move. Sieber makes it clear that she rejected Cait's own proposal during Romio and Juliet's wedding ceremony because she wanted a serious proposal from him. As for Romio and Juliet themselves, they have bought a house in Dahlia island, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">once again</a> they have little room for time together, since they have to return to Towa and the West because of their responsibilities and can only meet again on the weekends.

</li><li> The last issue of <em>Hard Time</em> was centered around Ethan's parole review, and all the principle characters, mostly Ethan's fellow prisoners, had their "endings" revealed.

Most are ministering in various churches across the Mediterranean area "Titus is in Dalmatia... Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus" a couple have fallen away from Christianity, and one is "ill in Miletus".

<ul><li> Malaki the rancor keeper freed Porcellus the chef from his cell, then the pair looted the treasury and opened their own restaurant in Mos Eisley with the proceeds.
</li><li> J'Quille the Whiphid found he now had a bounty on his head if he ever left Tatooine and, unable to take the planet's heat any longer, joined the B'omarr monks and exchanged his body for a brain jar.
</li><li> Mara Jade was kept very busy.
</li><li> Gartogg the Gamorrean left the palace with others heading to Mos Eisley, where he became an enforcer for a smuggling operation and faithfully took the dried-out mummies of the kitchen boy and a B'omarr monk (whose murders he'd solved) with him everywhere he went.
</li><li> Ephant Mon returned to his homeworld and started a religious sect that worshipped the Force.
</li><li> Max Robo and Sy Snootles split up; Max joined the Rebellion as an entertainer and later started his own successful multi-planet chain of restaurants, while Sy tried for a solo career that went poorly, forcing her to hook up with other jizz bands to keep her career going. Droopy vanished into the desert and is supposedly still out there with other Kitonaks, whose music can still be heard.

</li><li> <em>Ambulance</em> is one of many British documentary series focusing on medical and emergency services, for which an unofficial "industry standard" has emerged whereby these epilogues are presented as silent footage or stills in a shrunken window with white-on-black text captions beneath and accompanying music (which will fade out to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfSilence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MomentOfSilence">Moment of Silence</a> if the person died).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAstronautWivesClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAstronautWivesClub">The Astronaut Wives Club</a></em> ends with Max narrating what happens to all of the Mercury families in the last minutes of the finale.
</li><li> Each episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">Band of Brothers</a></em> had been topped and tailed by interviews with the survivors. After the final episode, the interviewees returned - this time with captions telling you who they were. Near the end of the final episode when Easy Company is told that they are going home, Winters briefly narrates the fates of several of the surviving main characters.

A teen named Rick seems to have made tremendous progress and has taken to mentoring the teens as he is at the end of the 28-day inpatient program, but most of the other teens believe they don't belong in the program and don't have a problem. David Birney plays the lead counselor, himself an ex-druggie. The irony follows at the end, where Birney's character tells the group that Rick had overdosed; he had run into some old friends who tried to get him to try a new drug, Rick refused at first but when they followed him home and kept hounding him, Rick took the drug and immediately had a seizure. Then follows the epilogue, zooming in on an empty chair. All of the teens that seemed that they weren't going to make it do ... and Rick (whose post-script is saved for last) is dead.

While the obnoxious kids have their futures told, the main characters get spoof endings, with Jeff's being that he "banged Mark's mom. Twice." This later serves up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke">Brick Joke</a> over four years later in the episode "Cooperative Polygraphy" when Britta does indeed become the proud owner of a used iPod Nano.
</li><li> The final episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CornerGas">Corner Gas</a></em> had brief snippets discussing what the characters were doing a few months down the line, which ended up sounding just like the plot of another episode, reinforcing the message of the ending that things weren't really going to change that much.

Oh, and they've adopted the Doctor, Donna and the TARDIS as their household gods.
</li><li> A mild version, the ending narration of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em>, describing the results of the case investigated in the episode over a mug shot of the suspect.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DueSouth">Due South</a></em> did a similar thing at the end of its finale, "Call of the Wild", although the revealed futures were slightly more obscure and unusual than most other series. For example, Francesca Vecchio was revealed to have six "virgin pregnancies". The futures were probably obscure because they were quickly written, after the scripted ending to the finale wasn't filmed. The unfilmed scripted ending was found a few years ago and made known to fans.

Generally this means becoming bakers (or otherwise working in some sort of baking-related area) for contestants eliminated later, and a bit more community baking for the less successful. There have also been a couple of proper standalone Where Are They Now shows.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother">How I Met Your Mother</a></em>, in the episode "Gary Blauman", Future!Ted fills in on what happened with a lot of minor characters.

This model was dropped by the second season.

<ul><li> Though even your best intentions and what seems to be the best path can instead turn out very wrong...
</li><li> Also, even most of the good endings are just a less grey ending than normal. Take New Reno, you could have it turned into a place with schools and free, clean water for all...which'll be captured by raiders or forcibly subjugated into the NCR because they don't have any protection. On the other hand, you could leave it in the control of the Bishops, who'll fight for its place in NCR and turn it into a legitimate city...that'll fight for the rights for drug use, gambling, and prostitution.
<ul><li> Notably, <em>New Vegas</em> takes both the Wright and Bishop endings as canon; the Wrights are in control of a stable New Reno as part of the NCR, yet the Bishop child was conceived and became a powerful figure in the city.
</li></ul></li><li> The endings also tell you what happened to your companions provided they survived to the end of the game.

<ul><li> That is, every single character who gets a unique model, sans the Judge (he shows up during the one for the first game, though).
<ul><li> Until <em>Investigations</em>, that is.
</li><li> Even then, there are a few exceptions. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> April May and Sal Manella are not shown in the credits, most likely because they are accomplices to the killers. Winston Payne and his brother, Gaspen Payne, appear in the credits of their introductory games, but even in later games, they don't appear in the credits. Machi Tobaye doesn't appear, despite being a defendant innocent of murder, though he is guilty of the lesser crime of smuggling. And Ernest Amano, a somewhat minor character in <em>Investigations</em>, isn't shown because he has aided the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game and is to be convicted of his own crimes.</span>

</li><li> Due to the first game's fifth case being a bonus case added to the DS remake, both the fourth and fifth cases have one of these. It's the only game in the series with multiple epilogues.
</li><li> The DLC cases in recent entries of the series contain short scenes as their epilogues; their characters are not shown in the credits after the main cases.

</li><li> Most of them have bugger all information though. Some actually talk about them getting involved with whatever it is they're doing next time you meet them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsPhoenixWrightAceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonVsPhoenixWrightAceAttorney">Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a></em> also has one of these, depending on how you view it.

<ul><li> K.O., Enid, Rad, and Dendy remain best friends, and the latter three (and Carol and Gar) continue to celebrate K.O.'s birthday with him over the years. Individually:
<ul><li> K.O. became the hero he's always wanted to be since the beginning of the series and now owns and runs Gar's Bodega. In a Call-Back to earlier in the series, we learn that as an age 35+ hero, he is Level 100.

</li><li> Boxman continues his villainy for some time, but eventually retires and passes the company to Ernesto, Jethro, and Mikayla. He and Professor Venomous get back together when the latter apologizes, and are heavily implied to have gotten married as well. He also seems to have finally reconciled with Mr. Logic.
</li><li> Some of the original Boxmore robots have gone elsewhere: Darrell owns a farm called Darrell Acres, and Shannon(s) has her own show, with Raymond(s) providing the music. Boxmore is run by Ernesto, Mikayla, and Jethro, who are still making new lines of robots to attack the Plaza with.
