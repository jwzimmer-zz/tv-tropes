If children, they are depicted as adorable; if in their teens or twenties, they simply create a sense of awe and protectiveness in their older advisers. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">naive simplicity</a> may in fact make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">good (and sometimes ruthless) rulers</a>, as they prefer to cut through the red tape of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecadentCourt">court etiquette</a>.
</p><p>Because of their youth and inexperience, they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAKid">often underestimated</a> by the villains, who are frequently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilUncle">Evil Uncles</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Chancellors</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilPrince">Princes</a> who were responsible for the assassination of the previous ruler, are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">currently in control, and do not intend to give it up</a>. If the Queen Mother is regent, she is likely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">over-control the young monarch</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">be unwilling to put down her power</a>, though she is less likely to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">actively evil</a>.
</p><p>They usually exhibit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">great wisdom</a> in the course of the story, thus justifying their enormous power despite their youth.

Many humans in the Pokemon world called Manaphy "Prince of the Sea", because it was a rare Pokemon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:

This did not stop him from becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears">a very competent captain</a> of the Tenth Division.
</li><li> Yachiru Kusajishi is a literal kid who somehow ends up with the office of lieutenant of the Eleventh Division. This is because the division adheres to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a> and no one except for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Kenpachi Zaraki</a> is stronger than her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She is later revealed to be the true form of Kenpachi's zanpakuto, however, which makes this a subversion.</span>

</li><li> Lelouch. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Before he turned 19, he already had started the world's largest revolution and took over half of the world. After he lost that half due to betrayal by his subordinates, he then proceeded to take over the <em>other</em> half, then went back and re-conquered the first half. As an eighteen year old, he was the first man to ever rule the entire world. He then proceeded to bring about the first era of true world peace by ordering his own death, at the hands of his equally young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Dragon</a> under the mask of Zero, thus leaving the path clear for Nunners becoming the Empress <em>and</em> with said dragon as a prospect <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">Mysterious Protector</a>.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TrinityBlood">Trinity Blood</a></em> features two examples: His Holiness Alessandro XVIII, 399th Pope of Rome; and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Seth Nightroad</span>, Eternal Empress of the Methuselah Race.

Dinobots are canonically younger than the rest of the Autobots (at the time of the 1986 movie, they are twenty years old as opposed to millions of years), and the author's interpretation of the Dinobots gives them a younger mental age than the rest of the Autobots as well. For this reason, Swoop (aka Pterodactus Prime) qualifies for this trope.

Justified in the storyline even when the characters are unaware of her advance knowledge as she has already shown her heroism when she merged with the Allspark, allowing her to see both the human and Cybertronian sides of various issues, and Ironhide himself observes that Optimus became a leader at the equivalent of Alison's age back on Cybertron.

Apparently, Ender's older brother Peter and sister Valentine are just as smart as him, but they don't appear to have the qualities the fleet requires. Peter has all the makings of a serial killer (he psychologically tortures Ender and Valentine and dissects squirrels while they're alive), and Valentine has too much empathy for war. While Ender is at Battle School, Peter convinces Valentine to help him take over the world in order to prevent another world war, which is sure to start as soon as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeePeople">buggers</a> are defeated. They create online personalities called Locke (Peter) and Demosthenes (Valentine), which argue competing points with the eventual goal of having Locke having so much influence he can write policy for the entire world. By that point, the truth that they're really children will be known, but no one will care. And yes, this is exactly what happens. A short war breaks out after Ender beats the buggers (before he's 16), and Peter manages to stop it and is made Hegemon of Earth shortly after. Valentine's (or rather Demosthenes's) writings are still read and discussed thousands of years later. Oh, and Ender also manages to inadvertently start a new religion before he's 20.

Being a rather realistic medieval <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowFantasy">Low Fantasy</a>, children have to grow up a lot faster, both physically and psychologically, than in real life with disastrous consequences whenever they have to take positions of authority:
<ul><li> Joffrey Baratheon is a spoiled little sadist who is far more interested in using his power to feed his destructive urges than to do any actual ruling. Even before he became king, everyone saw him as a tyrant in the making and feared what he'd be like on the throne; the answer turns out to be "even worse than they ever imagined". He ordered Ned Stark's execution on a childish whim, which went completely against the warnings of his more politically-savvy family. This sparked a civil war which devastated much of Westeros. Eventually, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he gets poisoned by his own allies at his own wedding at the age of 13.</span>
</li><li> Robert Arryn is a sickly, stunted boy who becomes Lord of the Vale at age 6 after his father's death. Robert is entirely dependent on his mother and not very likely to live long at all. His step-father and bannermen are all vying for the title of Lord Protector so they can rule in his stead. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The death of his mother at the hands of Petyr Baelish leads him to become emotionally unstable and he clings to Sansa as a maternal surrogate, who is 13-years old.</span>
</li><li> Jon Snow <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is made Commander of the Night's Watch at the age of 16. While he is just as honourable as his father, heroic, and quite a competent leader and strategist for his young age, very few of his older officers respect him. Compounded with mistrust from some due to his young age, his time with the Wildlings, his sympathy for the hardships faced by Wildling men, women, and children, and changes he makes in his efforts to save everyone from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreaterScopeVillain">oncoming army of the dead</a>, he eventually gets betrayed and stabbed by a group of his own men and it's left ambiguous whether or not he survives.</span>
</li><li> Likewise, Daenerys Targaryen is a heroic character with the best of intentions and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">is another teenaged ruler in this series, becoming the young Queen of Meereen. She struggles with rule when she becomes queen, tries to free the slaves, and utilizes some rather extreme methods for the sake of justice, leading to displeasing some around her. An assassination attempt is made on her life and after an incident in the fighting pits, she is believed by many Meereeneese to be dead, but in actuality, she escaped the city on her dragon, Drogon.</span>
</li><li> Robb Stark becomes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the King in the North at age 14. Similar to his half-brother Jon Snow, he is honorable like their father, a young leader, competent in rulership for his age, and does his best to do the right thing but ends up displeasing some very important allies when he breaks a betrothal agreement. These allies — some of whom are his own men — betray and kill him in an event known as 'The Red Wedding'.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tommen Baratheon</span> is young, timid, and signs any decree thrown in front of him, making him quite a doormat and easy to manipulate.
</li><li> A few of the Targaryen kings ascended to the Iron Throne as minors:
<ul><li> Jaehaerys I was crowned at 14, with his mother serving as regent for the two years before he reached majority; in contrast to many of the above young rulers, his reign was a long and prosperous one, and he himself was well-loved and respected by most.
</li><li> Aegon III became king at only 11, with a council of regents ruling in his name for five years. Deeply traumatized by the events of the civil war that had led to him being the top claimant, he nevertheless survived to adulthood and worked to help the realm recover, though he himself rarely took joy in anything for the rest of his life. Due to his lost childhood, he was noted as seeming much older than his years to many of his subjects.
</li><li> His son Daeron I was 14 when his father died, though he did not have a regency. A charismatic warrior prodigy, his priorities lay solely on conquering Dorne and completing the conquest of the continent that his ancestor had started, leaving most of the work of actually running the kingdom to his uncle. Before he hit 16 he had succeeded in this goal...for about a summer, after which it turned out that a talent for winning land on the battlefield did not translate to diplomatic skill at keeping its people from rebelling. Many thousands of lives were lost trying to reclaim Dorne before Daeron was assassinated only four years into his reign.
</li><li> Daeron's brother Baelor I succeeded him at 17, though by Westerosi standards he was considered an adult.

</li></ul></li><li> This was a pattern in the Scottish House of Stewart/Stuart during the 15th and 16th centuries, with <em>seven</em> consecutive monarchs coming to the throne in their minority:
<ul><li> James I became King of Scots at the age of 12, and in exile, a captive of the English. He was a younger son of the elderly Robert III - his much older brother, David, was captured and probably killed on the orders of their uncle, the Duke of Albany. He remained imprisoned and unmarried until 1424, at the age of 30, and a son was not born until 1430. He was assassinated in 1437, leaving the throne to...
</li><li> James II, just six and a half years old at his accession. He married much younger than his father (at 19) and had seven children, including three sons who survived infancy, the first of whom was born in 1451. However, James II was very warlike and an artillery enthusiast, which resulted in his early death at the age of 29, having been killed by a cannon which exploded as he was besieging an English castle.
</li><li> As a result, James III became King at the age of nine. Less warlike than his father, he also sired three boys, all of whom survived infancy. However, he was unpopular with the Scottish nobility, and he feuded constantly with his two brothers, both of whom enjoyed the support of not only much of the aristocracy but also those meddling English, plunging the country into intermittent civil wars which plagued his later reign. Surprisingly, he held out until 1488, after almost a decade of fighting, before he was finally killed in the Battle of Sauchieburn. By this time, most of the rebels had shifted to supporting his eldest son...
</li><li> James IV, who became King of Scots at the age of 15, the closest any Stewart would come to ascending the throne as an adult in a span of over two centuries. In fact, he assumed personal rule right away, and was a very successful and popular King, today regarded as the first King of the Scottish Renaissance. Although he continued his father's conflicts with England, backing several pretenders to the throne held by Henry Tudor, he eventually agreed to a peace treaty which would see him marrying Tudor's eldest daughter, Margaret, in 1502. The King of Scots was almost 30 years old at this point, and his only child to survive infancy was not born until 1512. By this time, the alliance with England was collapsing as a result of Henry Tudor's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">more bellicose son</a> (and his own brother-in-law) having succeeded him and declaring war on France in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ItalianWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ItalianWars">War of the League of Cambrai</a>.

</li><li> James V, just seventeen months old. His mother, naturally pro-English, briefly served as Regent until she remarried, allowing for more pro-French forces to assume control of foreign policy. Protracted marriage negotiations with the King of France resulted in a short-lived union with his sickly daughter Madeleine, who survived the wedding by only six months. James then remarried to a daughter of the Duke of Guise, but although two sons were born of this union, neither survived infancy. James began warring with England once again in 1541, shortly after his mother's death, and despite some initial victories, he was badly defeated at the Battle of Solway Moss the following year. By this time, he had already fallen ill, and died of what was probably cholera just three weeks later; he had only just learned that his last child, born six days before his death, was a girl, resulting in his famous quote: "<em>it came wi a lass, it'll gang wi a lass</em>" - referring to the House of Stewart's accession to the throne through marriage to a daughter of Robert the Bruce, and how this dynasty would now come to an end by his own daughter's marriage.

Her mother, Mary of Guise, was her Regent, and sought to marry her daughter to a French prince; it just so happened that the King's eldest son, the Dauphin, was available. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HenryVIII">Henry VIII</a>, on the other hand, wanted to marry his grand-niece to his own son and heir, Prince Edward - either way, it seemed likely that a personal union with another, larger and more powerful country was in the cards for Scotland. Henry VIII went to war with Scotland for Mary's hand, in a conflict known as the "Rough Wooing" - ultimately, the Scots won out (the last time they would successfully defend their independence from England) and a marriage with Dauphin Francis ensued. His father, Henry II, died in a jousting accident, and Francis himself became King in his minority, at age 15, in 1559. However, by this time, the Protestant Reformation was sweeping through Scotland, and many Scots disliked the idea of being ruled by the arch-Catholic French. The question was rendered moot by the death of the sickly Francis II in 1560; Mary returned to Scotland and eventually married her cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, thus securing the Stuart<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7uqjd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7uqjd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7uqjd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the spelling was changed from "Stewart" because Mary's French relatives and in-laws apparently kept mispronouncing it</span> dynasty on the Scottish throne. However, her second marriage was turbulent and, despite the birth of a son, James, in 1566, Darnley was violently murdered the following year. Mary then married her husband's murderer, and the resulting furor led to her forced abdication in 1567. She subsequently fled to England and, just like her ancestor James I, was imprisoned, though she was ultimately executed in 1587. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatCouldHaveBeen">Had she reigned until her death (or longer)</a>, her eldest son would <em>not</em> have been an example of this trope, but the way things turned out...

This resulted in the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland which endures to this day. James VI was the first Scottish monarch to make it past the age of fifty since Robert III (who died at 68 in 1390), and he also seems to have broken the curse which resulted in Scottish monarchs coming to the throne in their minority; when James VI (and I) died in 1625, his son <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CharlesI">Charles</a> was already 24 years old (although, granted, said son had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishCivilWar">other problems</a> during his own reign).

Since Fuad I was less than a year old at the time of accession and Farouk left the country for Italy, he was never formally crowned, with the Council of Regency led by Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim acting as regent for Fuad II until he came of age. In 1953, the Egyptian revolutionaries formally abolished the monarchy and declared Egypt a republic; as a result, he was the uncrowned King of Egypt and the Sudan in absentia from July 26, 1952, until June 18, 1953, even though his reign was never formally recognized.

<ul><li> Actually, many Japanese emperors were like this, such as the eight-year-old Antoku from the <em>Tale of the Heikei</em>. It was practice for hundreds of years to keep very young men on the throne so that the real ruling of the country was left to the members of the Fujiwara clan, serving as regents, who also married their children into the line whenever possible. Many emperors abdicated early and took on <em>more</em> power and authority as "<em>retired emperors</em>" while their younger successors were kept cloistered. And, of course, for about two hundred years during the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarringStates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarringStates">Warring States</a> period the real power fell to whoever was Shogun just then.

The throne was left vacant until the birth of the baby, which turned out to be a boy who was immediately proclaimed King Alfonso XIII. There was even a debate about whether his reign should be backdated to <em>before his birth</em>.
<ul><li> If Alfonso XIII had been female, his oldest sister would have become Queen instead (Alfonso's grandma had been the reigning queen Isabella II) ... maybe. When Alfonso's ancestor came to the throne from France as Philip V, he introduced France's Salic Law to Spain. Isabella II's father needed special and highly controversial legislation to allow her to become ruler in the first place, and it was a major reason for the revolution that eventually deposed her. Making it more of an issue is that while there was a powerful faction in Spanish politics at the time who wanted to make the monarchy into what it basically is today, it was <em>far</em> from certain that they would win.
