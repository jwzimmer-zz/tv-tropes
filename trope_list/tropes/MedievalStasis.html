</div></div><p>So, you have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicFantasy">Heroic Fantasy</a> with a <em>long</em> history in order to account for the fact that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">Sealed Evil in a Can</a> has been forgotten. You fast forward about five thousand years and reveal a world exactly like the one you started in! Same kinds of tools and devices, same form of government, same language, same culture—you wouldn't even need to dress differently to fit right in.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Medieval Stasis is a situation in which, as far as the technological, cultural, and sociopolitical level are concerned, thousands of years pass as if they were minutes.
</p><p>Heck, the "castles and knights" period of Medieval Europe didn't even make it to <em>five hundred</em> years, and compare <a class="urllink" href="http://de.academic.ru/pictures/dewiki/84/Tapisserie_motte_maquette.jpg">these<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak_des_Chevaliers">three<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.herstmonceux-castle.com/">castles<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to get some idea of how much things changed even then.
</p><p>Furthermore, there have been no wars — between countries or civil wars — no redrawing of any inter-state boundaries. No new nations have arisen, and none have been subsumed into others or wiped out. No more or less land is under the plough<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0isis');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0isis" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0isis');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> This is one area in which things most consistently changed over time throughout the last three thousand years of Eurasian (but not so much American or Australian, prior to European settlement) history, though there have been reverses. Population kept rising with it, of course</span>, no canals have been dug or allowed to silt up and no rivers have changed course or been made (un)navigable<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1jci5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1jci5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1jci5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Even today, 90% of the bulk/weight of world-trade entails shipping. Even today there is still no way to cheaply ship bulky items over long distances other than, well, <em>shipping</em> them. More cargo, both bulk and containers, is hauled on European big rivers annually than on European roads and railroads combined. Profit margins dwindled fast after the first 30km (one day's cart-travel) from the nearest shoreline, river, or canal</span>, and it certainly doesn't <em>look</em> like people have been making and accumulating things like brick and iron in the intervening time<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2tamd');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2tamd" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2tamd');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The amount of both of these in use has steadily increased over time as well. Once it's been quarried there's no reason why stone can't be used time and again, e.g. the near-complete salvaging of the stone sections of The Great Wall Of China for use in people's houses (it's had to be rebuilt a few times from scratch for just this reason). In the same vein iron was just too useful not to be well-used and looked-after and salvaged and accumulated. Knowledge and writings (scrolls, books, etc), too, have steadily accumulated over time. Most of it isn't remotely useful, of course, but it's still nice to have. Exceptions to the Rule Of Accumulation abound, such as iron-poor Japan — the islands had so little iron that it was profitable to import it from Korea and China, and every single piece of iron armour was painstakingly coated in lacquer to prevent even the slightest bit of it from being lost to rusting </span>. There have been no demographic changes (both population increase and the subsequent inevitable decrease<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3br6y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3br6y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3br6y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The soil can only support so many people. All it takes is one bad harvest and a nasty cold going around, and <em>bam</em>. Demographic decline. Then, sooner or later, the cycle starts all over again </span> have caused major changes), no changes of religion or religious observance<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4uuwy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4uuwy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4uuwy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Europe's Medieval period saw two — increasingly religious through the late dark ages as Pagan Europe was conquered or converted, increasingly secular until the 14th Century or so, then increasingly religious once more until the end of the 15th century reached the old high of general religiousness </span>, no changes of dynasty, no new organizations of political or social significance (such as guilds), no changes in art or music or clothing, no new fashions, and no changes in academic or philosophical studies. Despite the apparent age of uninterrupted peace, there will still be a professional warrior caste standing — with undiminished wealth and status despite their redundancy — for the entire period. If the landscape changes at all, even in the course of 100,000 years, it won't be due to geological processes, but due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldSundering">magic</a>. Otherwise, expect the landmarks and geography to remain identical across the eons.

</p><p>Of course, the saying goes that necessity is the mother of invention and the reverse is also true. If a nation is generally acknowledged to be a much more safe, secure, stable, and more pleasant place than any of its neighbors, it may feel very little incentive for radical change. China and Rome went through long periods of relative cultural stasis in this situation. The Egyptian empire lasted a good <em>3,000 years</em> without changing a whole lot in most of that time. At the other end of the spectrum, a "primitive" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcadia">Arcadia</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShangriLa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheShangriLa">Shangri-La</a> that has everything it needs may feel no need to change things. Compared to Europe, old Polynesia could seem positively Edenic.
</p><p>Sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by long-lived inhabitants (since much of real life change is driven by generational turnover),<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5urx7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5urx7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5urx7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's very common for people to start craving stability more and more as they get older.

</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>There is an Enlightenment idea that the Middle Ages were a "dark age", in which the brilliance of the Romans declined. However, this only really applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkAges">The Dark Ages</a>, prior to the 9th century or so, when stone buildings weren't even that common. See also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Analysis/MedievalStasis">Analysis</a> for additional facts about the Middle Ages.
</p><p>Then again, the whole 'Medieval Stasis' thing could just be the creator's attempt to avoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotallyRadical">Totally Radical</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> by the most readily available means, with no attempt at in-universe justification. Probably the most thoroughly lampshaded example of this would be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GKChesterton">G.K. Chesterton's</a> <em>The Napoleon Of Notting Hill.</em>
</p><p>It should also be noted that some fans genuinely enjoy the lack of technological development and would be rather dismayed to see their beloved fantasy world suddenly discarding swords, plate and mail armor, and other such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting">standard fantasy tropes</a> in favor of guns and industrialization (even though the former <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">really were around then</a>). Not that that's likely to happen in less than centuries, so only stories that feature <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback">Flashback</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> that long really need to worry about it.
</p><p>The availability of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">magic</a>, be it of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">controllable kind</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildMagic">otherwise</a>, can have a huge effect — consider the influence reliable healing magic would have on the the development of medicine<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note69mix');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note69mix" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note69mix');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and that's not even getting into the massive cultural effects of longer lifespans, reduced infant mortality, etc.</span>. Then again, past magic might have been responsible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">current situation</a> in the first place. Besides, your average non-magical Joe would probably be all for technology, as it would end the magic user's monopoly over things like fast travel, healing, and most importantly, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">blowing things to bits</a> assuming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpowerfulGenetics">Superpowerful Genetics</a> is in place and prevents Joe from learning magic himself. It also raises questions as to why if wizards are so good they are content to let non-magic-using feudal rulers run things (unless the wizards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">actually do run things</a>).
</p><p>And then there's the question of whether science even works the way it does in the fantasy world the way it does in our real world. Considering that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardFantasySetting">Standard Fantasy Setting</a> typically already violates some of the fundamental laws of science (wizards who cast fireballs and lightning bolts are essentially creating energy out of nothing, which goes against the laws of thermodynamics), who's to say that steam can actually serve as a viable source of power? Do the chemicals that make up gunpowder actually react the way they do in our real world, or do they just fizzle and pop, if they even do anything at all? You might be able to use oil to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Kill It with Fire</a>, but can that oil still power an engine? If it can't, would-be inventors and innovators don't have much to work with.
</p><p>On the other hand, you probably still have water, rivers that flow, land, soil, and plants and trees grown in the soil. You'll have mountains, people and objects can fall and are held to the earth by default. Humans and animals will probably bleed. Castles and other structures have been built. In short, by default, the basic laws of physics will still hold.
</p><p>Finally, "stasis" does not necessarily mean "stagnant". It's quite possible for a world to continually experience intellectual, political, demographic, or other changes even if some other element of the world remains the same for centuries. A world that becomes increasingly democratic, egalitarian and interconnected over the centuries might still have everyone wielding swords and wearing heavy armor in battles, particularly if in this world steam engines and firearms are scientifically impossible.

</li><li> The world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> has been in the Middle Ages for the last millennium or so. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigzaggedTrope">However,</a> during this time span the world has seemed to have progressed through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLowMiddleAges">The Low Middle Ages</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighMiddleAges">High Middle Ages</a>, and is currently in a stage that seems to combine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLateMiddleAges">The Late Middle Ages</a> with elements of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRenaissance">The Renaissance</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalierYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalierYears">The Cavalier Years</a> (this is more or less the time it took for real-world European cultures to progress through these stages).
</li><li> This has been divinely enforced in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDeathMageWhoDoesntWantAFourthTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheDeathMageWhoDoesntWantAFourthTime">The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time</a></em> by the head god, who believed progress, especially innovations from another world, would bring more harm than good (even if the other gods didn't think the same), so for 100,000 years, the world of Lambda remained almost completely the same. The fact that Dungeons and Devil's Nests constantly spawn monsters that make it difficult to travel also didn't help things. Our protagonist decides to shake things up with his knowledge from previous lives to make the life of his followers much easier.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero">The Familiar of Zero</a></em> technology is currently the equivalent of 16-17th century Europe despite the current civilizations having stood for six thousand years with few major changes in ruling. One possible explanation is seen in the reaction of nobles to an internal combustion engine: It's a cute novelty, but they can do the same with magic and it'd be wasteful to make something like it for commoners. Besides, said engine only makes a little mechanical toy snake head move instead of trying for something more practical like a horseless carriage or a motorized crane. <br/>Additionally as nobility is virtually synonymous with being a mage the great majority of well educated people, who are the ones that would normally carry out most innovation are magic users, who would mostly have little use for most of the inventions of this time period and earlier.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em> centers in the Great Kingdom of Shin Makoku, which is purportedly 4,000 years old, and has been ruled by the same, true-breeding twelve families the whole time, without any advancement of technology past 'horses and swords,' and an apparent decline in magic. Partially justified in that they've been being shepherded through all that history by the deific presence of their first king, who picks all their new kings and protects them, etc. Less justified in that the rest of the world has only moved forward very slightly, either. <br/><br/>A lot of the same countries are still around from four thousand years ago, some of them still ruled by the same family who ruled them back then. Or the family that exiled that family and took over, if the previous family was an ally of our guys (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> rules a country previously ruled by Conrad's father's family, loyal human allies of Shinou). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">With reference to this, Conrad inserts himself into the middle of a succession dispute in Season 3, to distract the new villain who had the last one offed.</span> On the other hand, the Mazoku, the race occupying Shin Makoku, appear to have bred to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">incredibly long-lived</a> in the four thousand years since breaking off from the rest of humanity. Apparently concentrating the magic-user genes can have really impressive effects.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ScrappedPrincess">Scrapped Princess</a></em>, what at first appears to be a stock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalEuropeanFantasy">Medieval European Fantasy</a> setting is actually the ruins of a highly advanced society possessing artificial intelligences, computer systems, and flying fortresses, not to mention <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>. Their society was artificially sealed into the Dark Ages by an external force after the collapse of this civilization. With stability enforced by genocide of uppity populations.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SoImASpiderSoWhat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SoImASpiderSoWhat">So I'm a Spider, So What?</a></em> the world where the protagonist reincarnates has been in a medieval or similar state for several centuries. This is explained by two factors.
<ul><li> Monsters are powerful, wide-spread, and come in large numbers. As a result humanity has been condensed into smaller, defended locations and much of the world is unknown to them. Even the seas are off-limits as dragons will attack anything that enters them.
</li><li> As a result of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">ancient civilization</a>'s disastrous war, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the System was implemented. To promote personal combat, certain chemical reactions such as the burning of gunpowder is suppressed within the System</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> The underground villages of Earth in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> have been in a state of technological stasis for a while, because the village elders proclaim that leaving the villages equals death. This is justified however because of the Beastmen on the surface, whose sole purpose is to crush mankind. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Further justified in that the Beastmen were devised not to evolve beyond their current state, because the Anti-Spirals would detect if there were more than 1,000,000 humans on the surface of the Earth and would promptly wipe out the human population.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked">Invoked</a> by the angels themselves in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThatTimeIGotReincarnatedAsASlime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThatTimeIGotReincarnatedAsASlime">That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime</a></em>, where they descend in mass numbers every 500 years to destroy any nation that has advanced beyond a certain level of development. The dwarven kingdom of Dwargo was the only known survivor of such an assault before the protagonist's nation of Tempest comes along.
</li><li> The world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheTwelveKingdoms">The Twelve Kingdoms</a></em> changes little from year to year, although this might have something to do with the world being run by rigid rules governing the selection of rulers and commerce and travel between the kingdoms. Additionally, many of its leaders are immortal and have been strictly charged by the heavens with achieving and maintaining a happy status quo. The lack of any fossil fuels might also be a cause. However, a number of innovations, such as Buddhism, were introduced by people from Earth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld">Trapped in Another World</a>. <br/><br/>Rakushun also credits refugees from Earth with introducing paper, print and ceramics (presumably an advanced <em>type</em> of ceramics, like porcelain?). They use Chinese characters and social structures. Presumably the gods ran off 12 copies of classical China for reasons of their own. Their technology might be 'stagnating' at the level of late China, no steam (but no coal) or electricity (if that even works), but good mechanisms the fact that many kingdoms get major disasters every 50 years or so when the king dies won't help.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> has quite a lot of examples:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet">City Plane</a> of Ravnica has apparently been ruled by the exact same ten guilds for 10,000 years and counting. This is handwaved to some extent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt">by the existence of a powerful magical pact binding them all</a>, and some change seems to have still happened. But some of the stuffs don't quite add up (e.g., it's hard to picture the fractious slum-dwelling Gruul Clans having been the way they are <em>now</em> from the beginning, for one thing). Still, seeing how much happened in the same time in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> (i.e., basically all of recorded history, plus as much time in late prehistory), it's probably a good example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SciFiWritersHaveNoSenseOfScale">game designers having no sense of scale</a>.
<ul><li> Of those said ten guilds, four are still ruled by the same immortal magical creatures that signed the Guildpact, two are ruled by immortal councils, one is basically the physical manifestation of hidebound bureaucracy, and the other three are more or less insane and generally poor at long-term planning.
</li><li> With the <em>Return to Ravnica</em> block, the Simic actually go <em>back</em> to melding with magic, rather than using the more scientific-sounding cytoplasts they favored in the classical Ravnica, because an unfortunate incident involving the Guild's leader and a giant blob monster <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> made them virtually unsellable.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em>Tarkir</em> block has the first (<em>Khans of Tarkir</em>) and third (<em>Dragons of Tarkir</em>) sets form the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">alternative versions</a> of the plane's present, with the second set (<em>Fate Reforged</em>) taking place 1,200 years in the past. The differences between <em>Khans</em> and <em>Dragons</em> are <strong>far more pronounced</strong> than the differences between either and <em>Fate Reforged</em>, to the point that most of the clans even dress the same. This may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, as the art of cards is meant to include the mechanical colors involved, so (for example) the block's red/white/blue clan will always be dressed primarily in red, white, and blue.
<ul><li> But that <strong>still</strong> doesn't excuse why the clothing styles remained so static: Even if colors are fixed, clothes could still vary in terms of, say, shapes, proportions, materials, etc.
</li><li> The fact that the five clans have persisted for more than a millennium is also rather jarring. Look back at human history, and the <em>vast</em> majority of empires didn't last more than 300 years. Millennium-spanning empires did exist (e.g., the Roman Empire) but were an absolute minority. One of the clans has persisted for 1,200 years? That's... okay. All five persisted for 1,200 years? That's a little bit less believable.
</li></ul></li><li> Surprisingly for a set explicitly focused on history, averted with <em>Dominaria</em>. Sixty years after the apocalyptic events of <em>Time Spiral</em>, the plane is covered in a variety of diverse cultures that, while they share the names of their ancient counterparts, have radically altered aesthetics and values, with advancements in both technology and science. There is a strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScavengerWorld">Scavenger World</a> component, as to be expected from a world littered with the abandoned war machines of several apocalypses, but all in all the cultures of Dominaria have only advanced since they were last seen.

Being that Ramaat is a world with three suns, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">this actually makes sense</a>, as it would keep the world from being cooked by solar radiation.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, it turns out Odin was a member of the Prehistoric Avengers. He had created the Mjollnir at a time when the Earth was in an Ice Age and humanity was only starting to evolve. Fast forward to the 21st century, and humans have anti-gravity, energy weapons and other weird science tech while the Asgardians are still using chamber pots and catapulting the full ones over the Asgard walls.
</li><li> In general, Asgard as it appears in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheMightyThor">The Mighty Thor</a> tends to zigzag the trope. For the most part they don't seem to have any technology beyond medieval (of course, with their strength, speed, and durability, why bother inventing bullets?), but sometimes they'll have actual starships and laser cannon fortifications. It seems less like Medieval Stasis and more like "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">all the coolest bits of history happening at once</a>".

These traditionalists are part of the reason Twilight met such opposition with her reforms, though things are changing in that regard now.
<ul><li> As Pinkie's chapter reveals, this also applies to medicine, with many ponies with mental problems simply declared lost causes because there's no magical cures for their conditions or arcane treatments in the works, with many simply locked up in sanitariums. Pinkie is lucky enough to have a family that can afford to import the medicine she takes, allowing her to be herself and use her talents while maintaining her sanity, but others aren't as lucky, which is part of the reason Pinkie supported Twilight's attempts to advance Equestria's medicinal knowledge.

Both Halkagenia's technology and magic are far behind Earth's and Osmond theorizes it's because with the Church (which is highly conservative in nature) mediating between the countries, they haven't had any large scale wars in millennia. On Earth there's numerous magical factions at war with each other, leading to constant innovation. For example, what Halkagenia considers the best locking spell in the world, Saito considers remarkably simple.

<ul><li> The <em>Axiom</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE">Wall E</a></em> plays with this. As far as we are shown, all the robots and technology on the ship has remained the same, with variations being only being cosmetic differences ("Blue is the new Red!"). Justified because the people on board have everything provided for them (causing them to go extremely fat), and the ship is run by robots, who have set objectives, none we see are dedicated to R&amp;D. Some things have changed however. We see the captains get fatter (and more cartoonish) in one scene, but they also live progressively longer (implying that medical knowledge and technology to deal with the health problems inherent to obesity have progressed, at least).

<ul><li> The Na'vi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar">Avatar</a></em> have existed as a tribal hunter/gatherer society for longer than humanity has existed, making theirs a case of Primeval Stasis. Unlike <em>Homo sapiens</em>, the Na'vi have a stable population, don't suffer from diseases, and the planet itself provides them with quite advanced biotech for free, so they have no <em>incentive</em> to advance beyond neolithic technology. Due to these innate connections to their sentient planet and the rest of its ecosystem, they're arguably extensions of Pandora rather a real "alien race".

One of the female exiles complains of this, saying they refused to change and bring in new things. It seems to be one reason some of them were exiled, as they wanted such change.

A 20,000-year-old ship <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">buried deep beneath the ice in Canada</span> is able to recognize and upload Krypton's own version of a flash drive that was only created 33 years ago. That certainly shows that they haven't upgraded since then, but it's also revealed that Kryptonians had flourished and prospered for hundreds of thousands of years already anyway. That Kryptonian society was largely static for hundreds of thousands of years was pretty much explained straight up in the Infodump from Jor-El's avatar.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a> had ape society. Though some apes are seen using basic guns, their technology is mostly medieval. This is true in the TV series set in 3085, the first movie set in 3978 and the last movie (of the original continuity) set in the early 21st century with some scenes in 2670. Even clothing styles stay the same. This is complicated by the fact that the place of the TV series in the film continuity (if at all) isn't confirmed and the fact that it's uncertain whether the movies are in a closed time loop (so whether the society in the early 21st century becomes the one in 3978). The animated series did actually show ape society with 20th century technology.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Predator">Predators</a>' technology is never seen to advance regardless of whether they're hunting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pirate">pirates</a> during the Age of Sail, gangbangers in modern-day LA, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AlienVsPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AlienVsPredator">marines and xenomorphs in the future</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> offers a number of explanations: one is that the yautja's tech is stolen from an older race that attempted to occupy their planet, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">they can replicate and adapt it, but lack the understanding of its base principles to improve on it</a>. Another is that the Predators' society revolves completely around the hunt, and they've lost all interest in intellectual pursuits. A related theory is that their current set of hunting equipment is deemed "sporting" and will be used regardless of further advances, much like how humans still hunt deer with firearms or bows rather than smart bombs or armed drones. The latter is suggested in the comic <em>Aliens vs. Predator: War</em>, where a team of yautja assaulting a hive on a xenomorph-dominated world to capture its queen leave the spears and discs behind and take plasma rifles and grenades.
</li><li> The Asgardians from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThorTheDarkWorld">Thor: The Dark World</a></em> are an interesting case. They are a society caught in medieval stasis that is advanced far beyond medieval times. They are shown using the same weapons (swords, shields, and spears), technology, and armor 5,000+ years ago as they do in modern times. Horses are a common form of transportation. Yet they can harvest material from stars, have flying machines, and travel between worlds through wormholes. Implied to be a combination of their extremely long lives, emphasis on close combat, use of magic, and being at the top of the food chain so long and eliminated all of society's ills that they have no reason to change. It's also intentionally vague how much of this is just aesthetics; their spaceships are made to look like longships while their armor and shields incorporate force fields. More advanced technology that kept with the theme would be visually indistinguishable.

At first it might seem highly questionable that the Centauri and Minbari, who have been starfaring peoples for millennia, are not substantially more advanced than humanity, which has only been capable of interstellar travel for barely a century.

Basically, aside from the Real World (referred to as "The Land Without Magic" In-Universe), all other worlds seen are "Realms of Story," whose events have been recorded by magically-empowered writers known as Authors. Some worlds include the Enchanted Forest (where a majority of the cast hails from), Wonderland, and Oz, which are typical fantasy worlds.

In the time that humans went from simple bows to nuclear missiles, the Goa'uld haven't added trigger guards to their guns.

Unlike Star Wars, Dune or Warhammer 40,000, history does not remain static — several factions rise and fall over the 1100-odd years of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech">BattleTech</a></em> history, with the longest-lived only 7-8 centuries old and all of them changed from their original incarnations.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>: Practically each and every game world falls under this to some degree or another, perhaps with the exceptions of the bizarre <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em> setting, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em>, which features a Pulp Adventure setting influenced by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> movies, mixed with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonPunk">Dungeon Punk</a>, in a faux-19th century world heavily influenced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">Sufficiently Analyzed Magic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>.
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ForgottenRealms">Forgotten Realms</a></em> setting generally falls under this, with a few exceptions. Countries come and go, several fallen kingdoms/empires may have been built on the same spot, and politics has dramatically changed. To the extent there's enough ancient-to-modern history to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sourcebook">splatbook</a> (<em>Lost Empires of Faerun</em>) devoted to it. And while swords-and-bow technology hasn't changed all that much, humans have advanced out of the Bronze Age and into the Iron Age, new spells and fighting styles are constantly being developed, and one church (Gond) has the invention and development of technology as one of its primary goals, thus leading to things like the printing press and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">alchemical</a> equivalent of gunpowder.
<ul><li> The gnomes tend to avert this. Heck, the only reason that gnomish inventions aren't more widespread (and more willingly accepted) is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">that the gods are ''deliberately'' meddling</a> to keep things in stasis. The only reason the gnomes have accomplished as much as they have is that they are <em>very</em> innovative: every single thing that the gods warp to try to discourage them from playing around with technology is repurposed to do something that fits with the warping.
</li><li> Netheril, one of the lost empires, had medieval technology over a thousand years before the 'present'. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> by the Netherese reliance on magic, which was both more readily available, and more powerful than it is now. Also wizards really did run this empire.
</li><li> The lack of technological progress and continuous state of warfare are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">justified</a> within the setting by the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sorcerers.net/Worlds/FR/17.php">legend of the Sea of Fallen Stars' creation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which supposes that the gods made it so that the peoples of the world would never become too curious or cooperate too much, as punishment for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndManGrewProud">the titans' hubris</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">the Hollow World</a>, where the Spell of Preservation acts to inhibit cultural and technological change, thus maintaining what amounts to a planet-sized anthropological museum. Elsewhere in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mystara">Mystara</a>, technical and social progress is much faster in some regions (Darokin, the Savage Coast) than others.
</li><li> Partially averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ravenloft">Ravenloft</a></em>, where the northwestern Core has undergone significant (Clockpunk-level) technical and scientific progress in recent decades. The fact that most domains in the Land of Mists are less than 200 years old also helps spare it from accusations of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a>; Barovia is over twice that old, but is openly derided as an archaic backwater by its neighbors. However, the Dark Powers do interfere to maintain some cultural stasis, often by mucking about with people's minds, especially those of the darklords. For example, the proximity of Falkovnia (solidly Medieval) to other domains with Renaissance-era technology does nothing to change its culture, largely because the resident darklord is averse to both magic and technology.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Dragonlance">Dragonlance</a></em> by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunglingInventor">tinker gnomes</a>. Societies have come and gone, especially with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The Cataclysm</a> wiping out the most advanced empire on the planet and sending the rest into a downward spiral. But through it all, the tinker gnomes continue to plug away at their inventions (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">doomed by the gods to fail, however</a>). Despite their handicap, gnome ships sail the seas and rivers powered by steam (occasionally exploding); labor-saving devices process wheat (usually exploding); and other gnomish inventions milk cows, shear sheep, walk dogs, groom horses, and collect eggs (at the same time. While exploding. If you're lucky). The tinker gnomes' inventions are actually the <em>cause</em> of a lot of the stasis of the continent of Ansalon. Other races are so put off by the crazy and sometimes dangerous outcomes of the gnomes' technology that they don't have much interest in developing technology themselves.
<ul><li> One short story features an insanely evil tinker gnome whose latest invention, while complete, is still theoretical. His loving, if sociopathic, description of how it works place it squarely in the category of an atomic bomb.
</li><li> An extremely tongue-in-cheek article in a Dragonlance Splatbook describes one gnome's theory on constructing a giant span of strings sprawling across the continent, connecting every town and place of interest. Since the strings resemble an interconnected rope net, he calls it <em>The Internet</em>. And given it's appearance to a spider's web, he suggests calling it <em>The 'Web</em> for short.
</li><li> Subverted by the continent of Taladas, whose gnomes are actually <em>competent</em> and are known as engineers rather than tinkers. Their inventions work much better, and so Taladas is more technologically advanced than Anaslon. In one of the more recent editions, Ansalon's gnomes were also freed from the "curse of the tinker" and are now considered engineers on the same level as their Taladas counterparts, so Ansalon may soon start to emerge from the stasis.
</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Greyhawk">Greyhawk</a></em>; between the fractured state of its politics, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyGunControl">divinely-mandated lack of traditional gunpowder</a>, and the fairly small timescale of the majority of its events. The paladins of Murlynd, the hero-deity of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> and advancement for good purposes, dedicate themselves to averting this trope, and even use guns. One Dragon Magazine article also detailed a future version of the setting where this trope is averted; after a dwarven reunification leading to an explosion in technology and 1400 years of progress, Oerth ends up with a level of advancement more or less on par with the modern day, plus magic.
</li><li> A sourcebook on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpartRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpartRace">drow</a> explains why the dark elves' technology hasn't progressed much, even though, because drow are naturally resistant to magic and highly ambitious, they embrace technology nearly as much as humans do. Because drow society is characterized by ruthless scheming and infighting, drow inventors are extremely reluctant to share their discoveries or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">write things down</a>. As a result, clockwork devices, printing, gunpowder, and even simple steam engines have all been alternately invented and forgotten by drow over the generations.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eon">Eon</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunctionalMagic">magic is the stand-in for physics</a>, making mages the stand-in for scientists, and the study of magical fields and their effects on the world around them the stand-in for researching and inventing new ways to harness electricity and advancing technology, giving this trope a rather reasonable implementation. That said, and in keeping with <em>Eon</em>'s rule of thumb to provide subversions to every trope it plays with, the dwarves' general distrust for magic has lead them to advance technologically and has allowed them to invent things like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbows">semi-automatic, pump-action crossbows.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em> has an interesting take on this, based on the setting's conception for how technology works. It typically requires supernatural powers to develop and build anything more advanced than 16th century technology, and how easily this is done depends on the people in question. The Solars had the best powers, and governed an age of technology at <em>least</em> as advanced as what we have now, and frequently greater. The Dragon-Blood ruled Shogunate didn't have the means to maintain the Solar infrastructure practically anywhere at all, and was slowly falling apart due to infighting, invasions of reality and simple entropy. The Realm (also run by Dragon-Blooded) maintained a social and technological level roughly equivalent to medieval Japan (with the occasional remnant of previous ages) for about 800 years, but that was due to deliberately enforced restrictions. Development in the rest of Creation at during that period varies, depending on factors like security from raksha or Underworld attacks, Realm influence, and available resources and Essence-users.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/FadingSuns">Fading Suns</a></em>:
<ul><li> The church blames technology for the fall of the Second Republic, so the Engineer's Guild has mostly focused on maintaining or at most duplicating old technology. What little research they do has to be done in secret.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Vau</a> are even worse than humanity; they have not advanced at all since the Second Republic first made contact two thousand years ago due to having an (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">even more</a>) rigid caste system that prizes stability over all else. Though they were largely more advanced than even the Republic at its height.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Banestorm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Banestorm">Banestorm</a></em>'s world of Yrth has been kept at a Late Medieval level of technology and society, in part due to the Megalan Empire's Ministry of Serendipity, a secret police charged with hunting down inventors, technologies and other ideas which threaten the status quo. The other nations of Yrth appear to have similar organisations. In all cases, this is because mages worldwide are in favor of maintaining stasis to protect their position.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/IronKingdoms">Iron Kingdoms</a></em> deconstructs this (with the possible exception of the elves). A few centuries ago the IK were invaded by a nation with more powerful wizards, so to retake their home they had to develop new technology powered by magic. To make it even more shocking, it isn't just the humans that have advanced. At some point they noticed that certain bands of goblins, trolls, and ogres seemed smarter than others, and these sub-species were incorporated into the societies (gobbers are the most advanced, and make excellent mechanics). Later, it turns out that the Elves (the ones form Ios anyway) are even <em>more</em> technology advanced than the other other races as they have laser guns (or guns that fire magic laser beams) and force fields.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ironclaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ironclaw">Ironclaw</a></em>, even the oldest of the Great Houses are less than a thousand years old, the youngest two centuries, and they all have detailed histories that are anything but static. In the past hundred years in particular the gun and printing press were developed, and the High King surrendered direct control of the capital city to a council of merchant guilds.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">Enforced</a> by Rokugan's ruling samurai caste in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em>. Technology and magic are both very stringently regulated, with a strong cultural emphasis on the "Celestial Order" (parallels with the Tokugawa Shogunate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">are completely intentional</a>).
</li><li> The far future world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera">Numenera</a></em> features many weird locations throughout its universe. One such setting is the Gloaming, a solar-system-sized disc with a star in the center, inhabited by millions of worlds worth of creatures within a (relatively) narrow band of the disc. Countless intelligent species and societies living within the disc, no matter their apparently capability, have managed to remain in a low-tech, medieval society for apparently thousands of years. This is in part due to the influence of psychically empowered aliens, who wish to feed on the inhabitants, and find a low-tech, culturally simple world much easier to control.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pathfinder">Pathfinder</a></em>: The main setting — the Inner Sea region — has maintained more or less the same national borders, ethnic groups, languages and culture in the four millennia and seven centuries since the beginning of the in-setting calendar. The god Cayden Cailean, who ascended a solid two millennia before the setting's present, is still a near-perfect embodiment of modern adventurers and pub regulars. The kingdom of Taldor, which has existed as a unified nation for five millennia and counting, maintains the same government structure and internal divisions that it did when it was founded. For reference, five millennia is roughly the time that passed between the founding of the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation">Indus Valley civilization<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the first city-building culture known to have existed, and the modern day.
<ul><li> One notable exception is Alkenstar, a duchy where magic does not work anymore. They have rifled guns, experimental revolvers, and a gun factory. Taldor also uses cannons for artillery, and most of the nations seem to be at a more Renaissance level. Most countries have printing presses. However, most tech is expensive as hell.
</li><li> To some degree this trope is justified by the setting's history; it seems every few thousand years some sort of catastrophe causes empires to crumble and progress to revert to more primitive times. The big one was Earthfall, when the Starstone fell from the sky causing massive cataclysms and destroying the mighty empires of Azlant and Thassilon. A more minor one happened just a hundred years before the setting opens; Aroden, the god of humanity, was supposed to return and usher in a golden age. Instead he died (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">somehow</a>), and this causes a massive rift to the Abyss called the Worldwound to open, an endless hurricane several hundred miles wide to form, and weeks of storms and earthquakes.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RocketAge">Rocket Age</a></em>: Traditional Martian society strictly regulates the maintenance and modification of technology, as most of what the Martians use was originally made by the Ancients, giving it both religious importance and a need to preserve what could otherwise end up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>. This is slowly changing as Earthlings have arrived on the red planet, although the principality of Kirtal has begun improving, repairing and advancing on their own.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Traveller">Traveller</a></em>: The Vilani First Imperium was quite stagnant, leading to their defeat at the hands of the Terran Federation.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pendragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Pendragon">Pendragon</a></em>, which starts off in post-Roman Britain until <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KingArthur">King Arthur</a> takes the throne, then each phase of his reign parallels a period in the history of England from the Norman Conquest to the Wars of the Roses with technology to match.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> both plays this trope straight and averts it, depending on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">Fantasy Counterpart Culture</a> or fantasy race in question:
<ul><li> The Empire (more or less a pagan Holy Roman Empire) has evolved over its history from barely-united barbarian tribes through medieval feudalism, and by the game's present day is essentially Early Modern Europe, roughly the era of Luther and the Reformation. Firearms are widespread, as are more experimental and dangerous blackpowder weapons like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GatlingGood">volley-guns</a> and rocket launchers, and even cantankerous Steam Tanks. The city of Nuln boasts technological innovations like clockwork horses, electricity, indoor plumbing, and drawbridges, and is so shrouded in smog from its many factories that it could be mistaken for Victorian London. The printing press is in wide use, while the free city of Marienburg is experimenting with a stock market and democracy. At the same time, magic has been "unionized" into a number of colleges focusing on styles of spellcasting, developed with the assistance of the High Elven mage Teclis.
</li><li> The other main human faction, Bretonnia ("France") was originally portrayed as on a similar technological level to the Empire, but with a social situation more akin to the 18th century with powdered and bewigged nobles mincing about effetely and ignoring the plight of the massed poor. Subsequent editions have actually <em>regressed</em> Bretonnian technology to a High Middle Ages level and given them a more "heroic" slant, with a culture of bold knights and doughty peasants straight out of Malory's <em>La Morte d'Arthur</em>. It has been implied that this is due, at least in part, to manipulation by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">immortal rulers</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Asrai (Wood Elves)</a>. For game balance they apparently have blessings from their goddess to protect them from bullets.
</li><li> The world's minor human powers are more or less static. Kislev, as a mash-up of Tsarist Russia with a hint of medieval Poland, is backwards compared to its western neighbors. The humans on the rain-drenched island of Albion are still a bunch of druids and priestesses prancing naked around the maypole. And from what little is known about them, the Eastern Empire of Cathay developed iron armor and gunpowder weapons before Nagash was born in the local bronze age... and 3000 years later is still at the exact same tech-level.
</li><li> All the variants of elves are similarly stuck in stasis. The Wood Elves are isolationist semi-barbarians, the High Elves refuse to industrialize for aesthetic reasons, and the Dark Elves arrogantly insist that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AutomaticCrossbow">Automatic Crossbows</a>, both hand-held and siege engine-sized, are just as good as gunpowder weapons despite their game stats telling very different stories.
</li><li> The Dwarfs are a mixed bag. They were the first culture to invent gunpowder, and have been writing grudges about clans not returning another's steam engines in good repair for centuries. One coastal Hold has constructed ironclad steamboats and simple submarines, and the dwarfs can even field aircraft, gyrocopters and, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GotrekAndFelix">Gotrek &amp; Felix</a></em> stories, a zeppelin capable of traversing the Chaos Wastes. The dwarfs have two major obstacles, though: first, their old empire was fractured, and their constant warring with Greenskins and Skaven means that they're more focused on producing and improving their old weapons than inventing new ones. Second, dwarfs are intensely conservative, and distrustful of any technology that hasn't proven its worth over a couple of centuries. As a result, many young dwarf engineers with new ideas end up running off to join the Empire's engineering schools, adding brain drain to the dwarf's troubles.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatMen">Skaven</a> avert this trope and continue to advance with the help of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScience">Mad Science</a> — some of their more recent innovations include trains, long range communication devices, and gatling guns (many of which have puntastic names). Their technology generally sacrifices safety for results though, and is prone to exploding and other malfunctions.
</li><li> The Tomb Kings are a justified, and more literal example, as they are all the undead remnants of the Bronze Age civilization, and are thus essentially incapable (or possibly simply unwilling) of advancing their technology.
</li><li> There's an interesting case with the Lizardmen — they're the oldest inhabitants of the <em>Warhammer</em> world, and have some of the most powerful magical relics in the setting, but apparently haven't invented the wheel yet, something even the Orcs have gotten around to. Their Slann rulers are slow to react and even more conservative than dwarfs, due to reluctance over doing anything that might disrupt the Great Plan of the Old Ones. And when some Lizardmen tried to colonise a new area and got cut off from their froggy leaders, they regressed even further, to a society with less magic and overall co-ordination, with some completely isolated islanders devolving into mere beasts. This seems to suggest that not only are the Lizardmen locked in Medieval Stasis, but that it's only due to the Slann that they're not going backwards.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> game setting is another sci-fi example of this trope:
<ul><li> The Imperium of Man has been in a state of cultural stagnation and slow technological decline for ten thousand years. Regardless of its civil wars and periods of division, the Imperium is plagued by a hideously inefficient central bureaucracy and administrative infighting. The Adeptus Mechanicus have a monopoly on technology, wrap routine maintenance in superstition and religious ritual, and are more concerned with rediscovering the technology of humanity's lost golden age than trying to innovate. Some Imperial worlds have regressed to pre-blackpowder or even Stone Age technology levels, and when rediscovered by the rest of humanity may be left in that state because the natives make for natural warriors.
</li><li> The Eldar have been crippled by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">the Fall</a> of their galaxy-spanning empire, so that now even their own history is passed down in the form of esoteric myths and legends, and their limited resources are focused on preserving the technology they have rather than advancing. The Craftworld Eldar are focused on the Path, a philosophy and lifestyle intended to prevent them from falling into dangerous decadence, and as such are culturally static. The Exodites have similarly embraced a comparatively primitive existence on the galactic frontier. And the Dark Eldar have no intention of giving up the same hedonism and vices that led to the Fall, only in staving off the consequences for it.
</li><li> The Orks are much more dynamic. Their society is too chaotic and violent to let them develop very far in most cases, but they have basic technological knowledge hard-coded into their very genes, and are unconsciously psychic, allowing their more insane gadgets to function <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsifYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsifYouBelieve">because they think it should.</a> They've also come up with devices such as "deff koptas" and "Gargants" (helicopters and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>) within the Imperium's lifetime, have managed to invent crude tractor beams and mass teleporters that are more effective (and more dangerous) than any other race's equivalents, and in the era of the Beast managed to briefly <em>surpass</em> Imperial technology. Of course, Orks aren't driven by scientific inquiry or a desire for a better life, but the need for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> and more killy war machines, so culturally and politically they're perpetual barbarians.
</li><li> The Necrontyr turned themselves into mindless automatons serving star sized soul-eating monsters. On the other hand, they are so far ahead of everyone else already that it hardly matters. The armies used on the tabletop are scouts and raiding parties; their full-powered war machines aren't even reactivated yet.
</li><li> For beings that include the incarnations of change, Chaos Daemons and Gods tend to stick to swords, spells, claws and cavalry, to the point that the same models for a <em>40k</em> Chaos army can be used in <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy if you swap out the round bases for squares. In fact, for a god that was born from an ultra-tech alien species, a big technological advance for Slaanesh was when some Daemonettes discovered that a muscle-powered agricultural machine makes for a great weapon.

The Imperium first encountered them as primitives that had just discovered fire, then just under 6,000 years later were shocked that the alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RisingEmpire">Rising Empire</a> with railguns and plasma rifles were the same xenos species.

</li><li> Majorly averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>. Despite the "present-day" setting of 1000 AD having a strong medieval feel, a quick trip back to 600 AD makes it obvious that there has been some significant advancement in the intervening years.

Armies consisting of the same mixes of infantry, cavalry and archers/pikemen are raised from the same castles, cities and temples, which are ruled by the same types of noble, mayor or priest. The tech system means that troops from more technologically advanced cultures will beat their equivalents from less advanced ones, and tech gradually increases with time as does levy size (as well as new holdings getting built), so armies gradually increase in size and power as the game goes on. The tech system also unlocks new buildings, making holdings richer and more powerful as the game goes on as well. There are also areas of the game that starts out as tribes or horse nomads and may transform into feudal or republican governments (including the player if they were one of them), and frequent wars tend to change the political and religious landscape. That said, the game's mechanics also means that empires and dynasties are much more stable than they were in real life (though given it's game over if your dynasty dies out, the latter can be excused by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFun">Rule of Fun</a>), so if you start in 769 it's not at all unusual to see the Umayyad Caliphate of Cordoba (collapsed in 1031), the Abbasid Empire (fragmented and was subdued by the Seljuks in 1055), the Byzantine Empire (died a slow death between 1202 and 1453) and the Carolingian Dynasty (last male-line heir died in 1085) all still alive and kicking in 1453.

</li><li> There's one character in the series who suggests the setting might actually avert this; Marvelous Chester from the first game's Artorias of the Abyss DLC.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragaliaLost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragaliaLost">Dragalia Lost</a></em> justifies this trope.

In order to stop him the Goddess Ilia and the dragon Elysium united Humanity and Dragon so that they could seal the demon away forever. And humanity, in order to make peace with dragonkind, left their creations behind to live a more simple lifestyle. This along with the rise of a religion that actively encouraged stagnation is why technology has not advanced. Though recently some of that ancient technology was found and used again such as the androids and Manacasters.
<ul><li> The second anniversary event <em>Forgotten Truths</em> goes into great detail of what truly happened during that time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">1000 years ago when Dragons and Humans were at war an otherworldly being was summoned by Ilia, the same one who would eventually be revered as a goddess. This being grew to care about Ilia, who crafted him a body and taught him emotions. However the human government planned on killing all the dragons in one fell swoop with mana bombs. In an attempt to stop them Ilia and company tried to warn the dragons but were found by Elysium instead. He explained that humanity was nothing but destructive whelps who would doom the entire world because of their greed. So he forced a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">Morton's Fork</a> on her: the bombs that would be used to kill the dragons would have caused the world mana to effectively explode, creating a fire so large the world itself would be burned. So to prevent that from happening he effectively forced her to make the first Pack with him, creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">Dragalia</a> giving him complete control over all the worlds Mana and how it works, in order to force his desired order unto humanity and the world. This in turn also seemingly killed Ilia in the process. The aforementioned Otherworldly being, now known as Mordecai was consumed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">such rage and hatred for Elysium</a> that he became the demon that supposedly tried to end the world. Elysium then used Morsayati as a pawn, using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorruption">Black Mana</a> the latter created to wipe the slate clean for his new world. A world where Dragons ruled over all, where technology and progress would remain in stasis forever. While Morsayati was sealed, Mordecai had to shove him through a portal to make it stick, and Ilia followed Mordecai under the belief that the problems would continue if she stuck around; the entire Church of Ilia was a fabrication created by Meene, both to help establish some sense of order and prevent this tragedy from repeating itself and a means to cope with the loss of her adoptive daughter.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The land of Thedas from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge">Dragon Age</a></em> is hit hard by this. Due to over-reliance on magic coupled with distinct bans on in-depth research on the phenomenon, the nations of Thedas have remained stagnant socially and technologically since the fall of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagocracy">Tevinter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilEmpire">Imperium</a> over 1200 years before the start of the story. The only groups that seem to have made any technological advancements are the dwarves and the Qunari. Both isolationist peoples with very little reliance on magic. Even then, the advancements are extremely slow and, socially, both are <em>even more</em> rigid than the general populace.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em>, a dwarven merchant tries to "court" the Qunari into selling him the secret to their "blackpowder"; the Qunari leader he's courting explains to all involved that non-Qunari aren't ready for the responsibility to use the substance (not to mention it's a significant advantage for their military to possess). Earlier in the quest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Hawke</a> can ask why the merchant he's bothering when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">lyrium</a> can also act as an explosive. The merchant lists the problems with using lyrium as A) it's lethally toxic, B) its trade is controlled by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChurch">Chantry</a>, and C) its blue-white glow makes its user visible at a distance. Blackpowder has none of these problems and would be a great help against the Darkspawn Horde that continually attacks the last of Dwarven civilization. So, while the setting's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> is useful, it's also restricting the development of the cultures reliant on it. Why the Qunari haven't developed personal firearms isn't certain, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">but who knows why the Qunari do anything they do?</a> While the Qunari sense of honour might prohibit the use of personal firearms, they <em>do</em> have cannons for their ships.

The sentence "that mages are holding the world... back, even as they hold it up" could be used for every medieval fantasy setting.
</li><li> As of the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> this all may be changing; at least, it certainly appears that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> humanity has discovered gunpowder... and that gunpowder plus magic is <em>very</em> destructive.</span> The future ramifications of this remain to be seen.
</li><li> The epilogue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins  Awakening</a></em> has the Qunari sending assassins after a dwarven explosives expert who is dangerously close to figuring out how to make blackpowder. The Qunari actively enforce medieval stasis in this case to maintain their military advantage.
</li></ul></li><li> A recurring theme, confirmed by various ancient characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a></em>, is that the world is actually in decline. Technology advances or is reclaimed, albeit slowly, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderIsBetter">Older Is Better</a> is still in full effect for weapons and armor and they haven't matched the level of before the First Blight yet. Magic is consistently getting weaker, and even by that time had been much diminished from when the Elven empire was at its height. Some things, like the old Imperial Highway, are not really beyond their current technology but do require manpower and logistical capabilities that the modern kingdoms don't have. Bizarrely enough this even effects the Darkspawn, who have no culture to lose; the First Blight devastated the Imperium and the Dwarves at the height of their power in a grinding conflict that lasted centuries, but each subsequent Blight was shorter (from nearly two centuries to decades to merely a year at most) and less and less successful than the last, despite their foes being shadows of what the First Blight faced.
<ul><li> Though the case of Blights might actually be justifiable. In the first one, no one knew how to kill the Archdemon , who is the main cause of the Blight on the surface (since Darkspawn numbers are essentially unlimited the only real way to deal with the Blight is to kill the one organizing them). When the first Grey Wardens figured how to kill the Archdemon (around 120 years after the Blight), the tide slowly turned. The Second Blight was devastating because it came right after great upheaval in the Tevinter, making them choose to cut their losses in most cases instead of fighting. As kingdoms become more and more organized and Wardens became a more powerful organization, the Blights got shorter. The case of the Fifth Blight might have been a special one as well mostly since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it was artificially and accidentally caused by the Architect trying to end the Blights instead of due to the natural way of things, thus cutting the number of Darkspawn armies greatly</span>.

This may change, but the developer has said that the technology present in the game won't become more advanced than "1400 AD."
<ul><li> On the other hand, players can make ludicrously complex death traps, like one that uses water funneled from a glacier to freeze enemies — it's essentially a liquid nitrogen thrower. This isn't even getting into other mechanisms; one player made a Turing-complete calculator.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InGameNovel">in-game historical fiction</a> <em>2920, The Last Year of the First Era</em> is set about 1300 years prior to the start of the series, and the world is largely the same as it is in the games. Similarly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsOnline">The Elder Scrolls Online</a></em> is a prequel to the main series set about 500 years prior to the main series and likewise shows the world much as it is centuries later in terms of technological and societal progress. There is some indication of technological progression between the First and the Second and Third eras, with evidence that the First Era was more akin to Tamriel's equivalent of the Bronze and Iron Ages. By the later Eras, technology was moving to a medieval-level — for example, armor technology in the First Era tended toward leather and bronze, and a man in full plate armor was thought to be a golem rather than a flesh-and-blood warrior. By the Second Era metal armorsmithing was more common and plate armor began to appear. For reference, the Second and Third Eras covered about thirteen-hundred years, making both the Second and Third Eras only about three hundred years longer than the real-life Middle Ages.
</li><li> Dynasties are also much longer lasting than in reality. For example, the Direnni Hegemony of High Rock. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Altmeri (High Elf)</a> clan, the Direnni's once controlled about 1/3 of Tamriel's land mass at their height thousands of years in the past. They're now a mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">vestige of their former glory</a>, controlling only the island of Balfiera in High Rock, but they still exist and have political influence.
</li><li> At least in terms of technology and advanced knowledge, there are a few groups or individuals who provide exceptions. However, for various reasons, their advancements have been lost or have never proliferated throughout Tamriel. To note:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame">Dwemer (Deep Elves or "Dwarves")</a> were an extremely technologically advanced race. They were master enchanters and engineers, blending these skills to create <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a>-style technology far beyond anything any other group in Tamriel has been able to create. They also (in)famously studied the "tonal architecture" of the world, essentially the laws of nature and physics, in order to find ways to circumvent them, making them literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warpers</a>. One of the major ways they used this ability was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagnarokProofing">Ragnarok Proof</a> their creations, allowing them to function in working order for thousands of years. Among their other known creations were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mechas</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherControlMachine">Weather-Control Machine</a>, a Steam Punk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolAirship">Cool Airship</a>, and a computer-like machine capable of safely reading an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TomeOfEldritchLore">Elder Scrolls</a> which bypasses the usual nasty side effects. Unfortunately, while attempting to tap in to the power of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">heart of a dead god</a> in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendToAHigherPlaneOfExistence">Ascend to a Higher Plane of Existence</a>, they did <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RiddleForTheAges">something</a></em> which caused their entire race to disappear from the face of Nirn in an instant. Their creations have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>, and, while enterprising scholars and mages over the thousands of years since have been able to study and repair their technology, no one has been able to actually replicate their achievements.
</li><li> The Psijic Order is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilOfVagueness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmniscientCouncilOfVagueness">secretive</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenownedSelectiveMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RenownedSelectiveMentor">selective</a> monastic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalSociety">Magical Society</a>, the oldest in Tamriel in fact. Through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SufficientlyAnalyzedMagic">thousands of years of intensive study in the nature of magic</a>, they have become able to utilize it in ways the rest of Tamriel is unable to match. However, their philosophy precludes them from sharing these abilities outside of the order. They subscribe to the belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">The World Is Not Ready</a>, and must progress on its own, slowly and at a safe rate. Their many advanced feats include making their home island disappear without a trace (twice), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeatherManipulation">summoning a storm</a> to swallow the Maomer fleet whole, using various forms of teleportation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AstralProjection">Astral Projection</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Telepathy">Telepathy</a>, and there are even reports that they possess a limited form of clairvoyance and sight into future events.
</li><li> Sotha Sil is (was) one of the Dunmeri <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Tribunal deities</a>, three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeityOfHumanOrigin">formerly mortal</a> advisors to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDeadBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongDeadBadass">Lord Nerevar</a> who successfully tapped into the power of the aforementioned Heart of Lorkhan after the Dwemer (apparently) failed. In the millennia that followed, he spent much of his time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefectorFromDecadence">withdrawn from the world</a> in his self-built <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockPunk">Clockwork City</a>, studying the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseAreThingsManWasNotMeantToKnow">hidden world</a>". As revealed in <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, Sotha Sil's creations reach full blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> status, as he was creating complex computer systems, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MechaMooks">semi-organic cybernetic servants</a>, turned himself into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cyborg">Cyborg</a>, and may have even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainUploading">uploaded his own mind into his city</a> (meaning he may not have been killed during the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIIMorrowind">Morrowind</a></em>'s <em>Tribunal</em> expansion) all while the rest of the world was stuck in medieval stasis. Given that he is (was) a reclusive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a>, his creations and advancements have never proliferated outside of his city.
</li></ul></li><li> There is also evidence of this trope being Downplayed or Subverted in cycles throughout Tamriellic history, with technology progressing at times but the <em>regressing</em> for various reasons. For example, during the late 1st Era, the Second Tamriellic Empire under the Reman Dynasty engaged their rivals, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Aldmeri Dominion</a>, in what is essentially a "space race" to explore <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VoidBetweenTheWorlds">Oblivion</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritWorld">Aetherius</a> (which, given Nirn's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienSky">Alien Sky</a>, are essentially outer space and the celestial bodies). The Aldmeri used Sunbirds, ships somehow literally made from the Sun (which, in this universe, is a portal to Aetherius through which magic flows into Mundus). The Empire, on the other hand, used "Mothships", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingShip">enormous Ancestor Moths</a> bred, hollowed out, and flown into the void on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicWillpower">strength of willpower</a> alone. (Ancestor Moths have a special supernatural connection which also allows them to be used to somewhat protect mortal readers from the power of the Elder Scrolls, which is why the Scrolls are kept and read by the Cult of the Ancestor Moth.) The results of these expeditions have largely been lost to history, and operations gradually ceased because the trips were way too expensive for very little material gain (much like the real world space race between the US and the USSR after the initial trips). On the other hand, as magical technology regressed, mechanical technology has slowly improved, with new types of weapons and armor and machinery being slowly developed over the centuries. However, a great deal of both mechanical and magical knowledge has been lost over the millennia, due to a near constant series of disasters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeCrash">temporal anomalies</a> causing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicRetcon">Cosmic Retcons</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">political upheavals</a>, and massive wars, on top of the interference by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassGods">Daedric Princes</a>.
</li><li> The largest exception in the series to date, at least when it comes to the political climate change, occurs during the 200 year <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>. With no Septim on the throne for the first time in nearly 500 years, the Empire begins to crumble as provinces secede while its ancient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a>, the Aldmeri Dominion, reforms and grows in power under the leadership of the extremist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a>. On top of this were multiple destructive cataclysms, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsIVOblivion">Oblivion Crisis</a>, the Umbriel Crisis (in which a massive continent from Clavicus Vile's Realm invaded Tamriel), the Red Year (in which the massive volcano at the heart of Morrowind detonated when an asteroid struck it, davatstaing one of the most prosperous provinces in Tamriel), and the Great War between the Empire and the Dominion. For those used to the climate in the first four games in the main series, seeing the Empire in such dire straights in <em>Skyrim</em> is quite the shock.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fable">Fable</a></em> games, where society does indeed change over the course of time. The first game uses a basic medieval setting; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableII">Fable II</a></em> takes place 500 years later and has a distinct late Renaissance flavor (for instance, guns are commonplace); lastly, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FableIII">Fable III</a></em> takes place 50 years after <em>II</em> and the setting mirrors the Industrial Revolution of the 1800's. At this rate, if <em>Fable IV</em> ever comes out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopmentHell">Development Hell</a>, it could very well approach modern times.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em>: In the 116 years between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, the world has apparently changed very little. Even decades-old settlements look like they were just recently built out of the scrap available, despite their settlers seemingly having plenty of food and protection (so little reason they wouldn't be making their towns any more comfortable). Take Megaton for example, which has been inhabited for three generations and is a major trade center in the Capital Wasteland, yet all structures date from the settlement's founding and mainly consist of scrap metal scavenged from planes from a nearby airfield.
<ul><li> Bethesda acknowledges in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> art book that the lack of societal reconstruction isn't realistic, and is only that way to keep with the series' style.
<ul><li> The Capital Wasteland appears to be a worst-case post-apocalypse scenario, however:
</li><li> As the location of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C., it was one of the hardest-hit sites in the country. It's implied that nuclear bombs with a low explosive but high radiation yield were purposely chosen and used on the region to render it uninhabitable in the long-term (salting the earth, so to speak). The local watershed and much of the soil was consequently heavily irradiated. This made farming above subsistence level and obtaining enough potable water to sustain communities larger than a few dozen people extremely difficult <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> before the activation of the Project Purity water purifier at the end of Fallout 3's main storyline</span>.
</li><li> Another factor is the presence of Super Mutants. On the West Coast, the tremendous threat these monsters posed didn't arise until a few decades after the Great War, and fortunately that threat was dealt with in the first game, allowing the formation of the early NCR. The Capital Wasteland was not so lucky; Super Mutants began to emerge within a year of the Great War and were on the verge of completely overrunning the region by the time the Brotherhood of Steel showed up 22 years before Fallout 3 and reclaimed some areas. Super Mutants are still a major threat to everyone at the time of Fallout 3, but there is some hope: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the supply of the virus used to convert humans into new Super Mutants is running out, so in theory they could all be killed off eventually if they don't uncover a new supply.</span>
</li><li> Yet another factor is the Talon Company, a large group of ruthless mercenaries plaguing the Capital Wasteland. They were hired by a mysterious unidentified client to <em>deliberately</em> sow chaos and destruction throughout the region so that it remains perpetually stagnant and lawless. To that end they readily kill anyone who isn't a fellow Talon on sight (usually a one-sided fight since they possess weapons and equipment that are generally superior to what the locals have scrounged together).
</li><li> It also doesn't help much that there's countless dog-sized (at the smallest) mutated creatures, feral ghouls, haywire homicidal commercial and military robots, slaver bands, psychotic raiders, etc. all over the Capital Wasteland. It's actually more of a surprise that there's anyone left alive not to mention able to make new tech in Fallout 3 at this point.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">The Commonwealth</a> is also a justified version. The Commonwealth was struck by a large nuke that missed Boston. However, The Institute's dicking around with the world above by either sending Super Mutants out there, rather than euthanizing them, sabotaging a united Commonwealth conference, sending out synths to kidnap and replace settlers. Not to mention the constant threat of Raiders, mutated creatures and radiation storms.
<ul><li> The Institute controls a chunk of Massachusetts centered on Boston and has technology capable of creating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">Ridiculously Human Robots</a> so advanced they pass for human and can even question their own existence as well as the morality of killing humans and/or other androids. It's implied the Institute was founded by the remnants of MIT or the in-universe equivalent. Even so, the Institute has fallen to this trope in a less visible way: in contrast to other factions, they remain content to remain within their walls with what they have, wasting resources on ridiculous projects like synthetic gorillas. Synths, as advanced as they are, were designed with the objective of destabilizing the region to lessen the chance of the Institute being discovered.
</li></ul></li><li> The series also implies the world never left The Fifties in style and culture, despite the war happening in 2077. While transistors were only invented shortly before The Great War, fusion power was, among other differences, causing technology and society to develop differently.
</li><li> The Brotherhood of Steel in general IS this trope, they only care about preserving Old World Tech, they are in a slow death, mostly thanks to the NCR who don't care much about this trope.
</li><li> A large part of Mr. House's plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> involves averting this trope. He intends to use Vegas to kickstart a new era of scientific progress, eventually culminating in space travel so humanity can abandon their craphole of a planet for something better.
<ul><li> The same goes with the NCR just not to that scale as much slower, by the time of New Vegas California is near pre-war standards.
</li><li> This <em>would</em> be easier, if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Lone Wanderer</a> would just share the captured alien ship from the <em>Mothership Zeta</em> DLC. Of course, the first thing most would do is fire that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> at any area of the planet they don't like.
</li><li> The fan-made mod "Mothership Zeta Crew" addresses the issue of the wasted potential of the orbiting alien ship with an ongoing story-driven questline on par with official DLC.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em>, for two reasons. First, there exists a gargantuan sea monster named Sin that exists to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">destroy all the high tech it can find</a>. Second, the state religion made high tech taboo in the hopes of staving off said sea monster. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX2">Final Fantasy X-2</a></em>, set after the delegitimizing of the religion and destruction of Sin, shows that given the chance, Spira can rapidly take to new technology.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After 1,000 years after the War of the Magi</a>, civilization has rediscovered steam engines and "...high technology reigns." However, 80% of the world is locked in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis">Medieval Stasis</a> with a Victorian skin, as the only signs of any sort of technology are Narshe (steam and coal), Figaro Castle (but not South Figaro), and the Empire's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>. Although there are also gramophones in most houses.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXII">Final Fantasy XII</a></em> and the other Ivalice Alliance games, where the further you go along the in-world timeline the more things have gone to hell, mostly likely due to the sort of turmoil caused when your religious warfare gets even the gods involved. In <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> mention is made of how they no longer have the technology to make airships and by <em>Vagrant Story</em> even magic's been largely forgotten.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> uses this trope a hell of a lot. While politics and society may change a bit, architecture, transportation, weaponry, and technology in general is pretty much the same as it was 1200, 1000, 800, or however many years it was since the great cataclysm or war between humans and monsters/demons/dragons that sets up the game's plot. Most games also take place in different universe however, explaining this to an extent.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGenealogyOfTheHolyWar">Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThracia776">Fire Emblem: Thracia 776</a></em> do this rather egregiously, as supplementary materials indicate they take place a millennium and change before Marth's era on another continent, yet the only recognizable change in technology is the <em>disappearance</em> of light magic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Awakening</a></em>, set 2000 years after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemMysteryOfTheEmblem">Marth's era</a>, plays this extremely straight, though many liberties are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BroadStrokes">taken with past plots</a>. Apparently, records are well-kept enough that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Chrom</a> is able to identify historical figures by sight alone. Chrom is also aware of the majority of the heroes and villains from earlier games. Based off the lack of Cannons which existed in Marth's time, one could even argue technology has regressed! The only part of the setting to avert this trope is the geopolitical situation; the nations of Ylisse and Valm serve as the successor states to Marth's Archanean Alliance and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemGaiden">Alm's One Kingdom of Valentia</a> respectively, and Marth's former homeland of Altea is ironically now Plegian territory.

</li></ul></li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em> lore. The Golden Age of Man ran on Alchemy-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>; when Alchemy's power was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicGoesAway">sealed away</a>, the Adepts and craftsmen dwindled in power and number, beastmen went <em>extinct</em>, the very world itself began to crumble at its edges, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">Muggles</a> who had no way of working with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> became the dominant race. As a result, civilization experienced a <em>huge</em> kickback, but appears to have been slowly rebuilding technology even in the first two games, going by NPC chatter about newfangled developments in architecture and nautical engineering. Then the heroes reverse the seal on Alchemy, and during <em>Dark Dawn</em> there's obviously a fantasy-counterpart Renaissance in full swing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> averts this trope, with the 250 years between the first and second games having given way to full-scale industrialisation by the Charr — to the extent that the Charr have large gun platforms, cannon weaponry and even primitive tanks. Then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrystalSpiresAndTogas">Asura</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiTek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiTek">technology</a>.
<ul><li> The dates are about a thousand years behind the actual technology level. 1000 AD is clearly similar to the late 20th century in our world, just in a land where many of the medieval buildings have been preserved instead of torn down. 600 AD is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHighMiddleAges">The High Middle Ages</a> (although 200 AD might have been more appropriate in that case). 1999 AD looks like something out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheJetsons">The Jetsons</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingsQuest">King's Quest</a></em> universe: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> material says that magicians, mythical creatures, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">The Fair Folk</a>, fairy tale characters, and those sympathetic to them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">withdrew to another universe</a> to escape the enchroachment of "enlightment" thought that wanted to study them into irrlevance or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">destroy them through disbelief</a>. There is evidence that they're taking a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> route instead of conventional industrialization.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a></em> games jump around by millennia, but always stay firmly stuck in vague middle ages with very little technology thrown in. However, the world of Nosgoth is in a permanent state of biological and spiritual decay, so advancement might be hampered.
<ul><li> In the original backstory of the first game, there was minimal to no advancement in a 5,000 year period; later games retconned this to only 500 years.
</li><li> Interestingly, one game in this series completely averts this; <em>Blood Omen 2</em> takes place 400 years after the original <em>Blood Omen</em>, and in that time has Nosgoth go from a midieval fantasy world with sparse dashings of magitek and steampunk to a full on industrial revolution(still, technically, magitek and steam punk, but on a much grander scale). Averting this trope is one of the reasons that <em>Blood Omen 2</em> is the least popular game in the franchise; most fans felt it didn't fit withe the over all tone of the series (it also exists in an alternate timeline created by the various time travel shenanigans in the other games, so it has absolutely no effect on anything). Possibly justified, since the ones spearheading this revolution <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">are the Hylden, demonic beings mostly unaffected by the decay affecting everyone else since they rejected being part of the Wheel of Fate. And their reason for doing so is hardly benevolent — they want to complete the weapon that will wipe out everyone on Nosgoth but themselves.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfDragoon">The Legend of Dragoon</a></em> seems to have barely changed within <em>eleven thousand years.</em> This is even a plot point, as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> wants to destroy the world so a new one can take its place and advance farther. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's eventually revealed that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a> planned on destroying the world over 11,000 years before the story takes place, and possibly intended to do so every 108 years</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> has three timelines displaying varying levels of this (and standard Medieval Stasis in the era prior to the branching point, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em> through the first third of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> exists throughout, of course, although the amount seen and its prominence varies with the game's tone.
<ul><li> Timeline A, containing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em> through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ZeldaIITheAdventureOfLink">Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</a></em>, averts the trope in a strange way as there is a great technological <em>regression</em>. There is a clear loss of historical and architectural knowledge, loss of more complex clothing technologies, a large population crash, and the loss of much of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> artifacts such as juke boxes, telephones, hardhats, etc. Out-of-universe, this can be explained by the original two games being the <em>last two</em> games in this timeline. In-universe, this is explained as this timeline being one where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuyWins">Link lost at the end</a> of <em>Ocarina of Time</em> and Hyrule entering a long period of decline afterwards.
</li><li> Timeline B, containing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em> through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaFourSwordsAdventures">The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures</a></em>, has stasis throughout, with no seen loss of random schizo tech or noted advances <em>or</em> losses. Since it only contains three games, technology could still be progressing, just not enough to notice by the end of the timeline.
</li><li> Timeline C, containing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> through <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em>, averts the trope the normal way, with a slow but noticeable technological progression, including photography, steam engine-powered boats, and trains. This is likely caused by the massive social shift and need to adapt to the Fall of Hyrule and migration to island living.
</li><li> Across the franchise (most notably in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>) there is evidence that previous generations had technology that would be considered advanced even in the modern-day real world (such as artificially-intelligent robots and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMecha">Giant Mecha</a>). Even the Beamos enemy, which is present in most games, is evidence of this. By all appearances there seem to have been two periods of high technological advancement — one before the chronologically earliest game, <em>Skyward Sword</em>, that was ended by a war against demons; the other 10,000 years before <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, in a point where Hyrule developed incredibly advanced technology again but slowly crumbled back to a medieval level over the interval leading up to the game proper. <br/><br/>Notably, <em>Breath of the Wild</em> actively invokes this trope. Set so far in the future that it might be any of the three above timelines, the Sheikah managed to begin recovering, reinventing and rediscovering advanced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>. This sudden advancement and advantage to one tribe scared the king so much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureIsTheOnlyOption">he commanded them to bury all of it and abandon advanced technology research</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLongestJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLongestJourney">The Longest Journey</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamfallTheLongestJourney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DreamfallTheLongestJourney">its sequel</a> posit that, way back in history, the inhabitants of the world in question had to make a choice between "magic" and "science", and two parallel worlds were created, between which the player character can skip. Our PC is from the Science world, apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a>, whereas the Magic world is still on swords and bows, because anyone born with ingenuity and inventiveness ends up in the Science world.
<ul><li> There's also the fact that the laws of physics exists in a state of flux in Arcadia. Making a power plant must be hard when the technical principles you relied on yesterday have been inverted and will probably invert again by the end of the week.
</li><li> Twice, however, groups have attempted to introduce the Arcadians to new technology. In the first game, the Vanguard are offering people inventions from Stark (the science world) so as to subvert the power base of the Sentinels who believe that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a>. In the sequel, the magic-hating Azadi Empire takes over a large chunk of Arcadia and introduces airships and steam engines. However, it is mentioned that this is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a>, as this is the only way to make them function reliably.
</li><li> On the other side of the coin, most advanced Stark tech suddenly fails after the Collapse (the rebuilding of the Barrier between the worlds). Most in fandom speculate that this is because some of this tech (e.g. antigravity, FTL) defies the laws of physics and only worked through the unintentional use of magic. This explanation also justifies the high number of antigravity accidents prior to the Collapse, as magic is inherently chaotic. The entire world had to revert to using old tech, losing all contact with extrasolar colonies.

A few scientists also mentioned steam-power energy from foreign countries without magic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarEternalBlue">Lunar: Eternal Blue</a></em> takes place 1000 years after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LunarTheSilverStar">Lunar: The Silver Star</a></em>, yet there are practically no advances in technology.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em> universe has a zig-zagging example of the trope. On one hand, technology doesn't seem to have advanced too much since the Council started inhabiting the Citadel. On the other hand, we do know that it is advancing technologically, as more powerful "heat sink," based weapons are the norm by ME2, as well as omni-gel proof systems, and by Mass Effect 3, Mech suits and omnitool lightsabers have come into practice. On the <em>third</em> hand, everything about the technology in the Mass Effect universe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> is a trap. Everything is reverse engineered from technology left behind by the Protheans, who reverse engineered the tech from another race that came before them, who did the same thing to the previous race, and so on and so forth. The entire tech base is a trap set by the Reapers, who use organic life to further their own technology before taking anything good, while having the benefit of millions of years of development to crush anything in their path.</span>
<ul><li> On the <em>fourth</em> hand you have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Geth, the machine race that happen to not only have the most advanced technology (aside from the Reapers) and progress at the fastest rate, but since they believe in self determination, all of their tech is of their own design, and may be the only suitable counter against the Reapers.</span>
</li><li> Humanity's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly">tendency to avert this</a> is lampshaded in the second game, where by 2185 their businesses have become responsible for nearly every new technological innovation currently out on the market. This has forced the other races to break out of their complacency in order to keep ahead of the curve.
</li><li> One small aversion. You go out for Wrex's family armor, but it is made very clear that it is obsolete (it's well over a thousand years old) to any other armor you can give him. Wrex wants it for sentimental reasons and afterwards doesn't have a problem with you grinding it to Omni-Gel.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em> takes place in the 2030s, but technological advancement seems to have stopped after World War II (with some Vietnam trappings like helicopters). The sequels veer into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>, where one moment you'll be fighting propeller planes and the next you'll be fighting a giant laser-spamming robot in power armor.
</li><li> Averted, to a degree, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VIII</em>. Three plot points centres around recent technological and magical inventions (though you only deal with two of them in any one given play-through): <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The stolen Nightshade Brazier, the Necromancers' Skeleton Transformer and the Regnan Pirates' Prototype Super-Cannon</span>. In addition, the Handwave given for vampires in the party being able to walk around at day is that the Necromancers' Guild recently developed a new sort of amulet that protects a vampire against the sunlight. It's too costly for producing in any larger numbers, though, so it's only vampires that <em>need</em> to travel around that gets them.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> games don't even sport a medieval stasis. It's actually a sci-fi series where worlds have been created or seeded by a highly technologically advanced race, called the Ancients. However, due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a war with an alien race, the Kreegans</span>, the whole system collapsed and many worlds fell into barbarism for as much as 12 centuries. Considering the fact that this actually happened in the course of our own history, it's not strange. Also changes in styles, fashion and sophistication in building, etc., are clearly evident. Newer castles are depicted with different styles, weapon technology changes, newer metals are used, etc. It's just that the actual games span a time-frame of no more than a century, so these changes are not evident from game to game, so much; it's rather historical evidence present in the games (items that you find, building styles, etc). Games other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a> VIII or IX, feature actual laser guns, which are from the time prior to the event marked as the Silence (see spoiler). There are also spacecrafts and robots from the same period and tons of other technological stuff, depicting the advance of the Ancients.
<ul><li> <em>Heroes Chronicles</em> used the same towns as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> III</em> while covering a period many centuries in length (the chronologically first has been fan-dated to around 200 AS, while the chronologically last takes place around 1172 AS). Given that the series also used a grass/forest town to represent the Vori <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Snow</a> Elves, this is likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">Gameplay and Story Segregation</a>, however.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MonsterHunter">Monster Hunter</a></em> plays with this. Technology has visibly advanced as the series as gone on; the first game was very much Bronze Age/prehistoria with some very primitive firearms, but the latest games feature widespread use of balloons and airships, as well as advanced mechanical contraptions like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwissArmyWeapon">Switch Axe</a>. However, society as a whole hasn't progressed past the hunter-gatherer stage after all this time. Agriculture does exist, as indicated by the resource-multiplying farms you have access to in later games, it is just not widely spread, as that would require having to move outside the protective walls of the cities. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">Supplemental material</a> released only in Japan reveals that the world takes place <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">after the fall</a> of an "Ancient Civilization".
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth">Myth</a></em> prequel <em>Myth III: The Wolf Age</em> changes little from the original games despite being set 1000 years earlier, as commented on in <a class="urllink" href="http://www.applelinks.com/reviews/myth3.shtml">this review<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Dwarves still fight mainly with grenades, and at one point get a flamethrower to boot.
<ul><li> The backstory has them at this level for several millennia before that. They never have more than a millennium at a time to progress before the Leveler knocks civilization back down, though.
</li><li> The Humans and Dwarves were down to one city each at the end of <em>Myth III</em>, so even maintaining the status quo is impressive. The backstory is that civilization rises up only to be toppled again every thousand years, but even so they've been locked for at least six cycles.

<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> What actually caused the war was long standing social issues that weren't resolved between pureblood elves and humans and the half-elves stuck in between. As half-elves keep being rejected by the elves <em>every single time</em> the humans do something the elves don't like, the purebloods isolate themselves from the world and the half-elves are forced to try and make their way in human society, including the creation of magitechnology, in order to gain acceptance, after being rejected by Elven Society.

Despite being in the high age of sail, most of the world remains completely unexplored but uninhabited, and when scouts do go to the Outer Seas, they find pristine ruins loaded with treasure. Many regions of the game have ruins of completely different architectural styles, often lost civilization technology shows up that's at about the same level as the current world, but runs on such fundamentally different theory it's impossible to even reverse-engineer. Eizen, a treasure and history buff, mentions that there are a lot of independent civilizations that appear to have risen, and then fallen very suddenly, preventing any of them from getting much further than the current era is. It turns out this is a side-effect of something bigger: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">humanity would eventually destroy the world with the Malevolence they produce as a by-product of simply existing, so they periodically have their free will utterly suppressed to let it disperse. This takes a few generations; by the time it wears off, those left to rediscover independent thought have had the academic slate wiped clean and start over. This cycle is broken at the end of the game, so</span> by the time of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria">Tales of Zestiria</a></em> 1000 years later, technology has continued to advance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Touhou">Touhou</a></em>, sort of. The setting was a backwater back in the Meiji era when it was sealed off from the rest of Japan, so this really makes sense. Then the kappa started building sci-fi technology and a hell-crow turned into a living nuclear furnace, and things are starting to head towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a>.
<ul><li> This was averted earlier with Rinnosuke; the man runs a shop that sells "odd things," although most of the stuff consists of things that fell across the border. Among other things, he has a Game Boy, and iPod, and a small personal heater. All of these things work, he just doesn't know how.
</li><li> Also in the second game of the series, Rika is apparently the only human character who possesses the knowledge needed to construct motorized vehicles. She uses it to build <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness">tanks</a></em>.
</li><li> An aversion comes from the Moriya Shrine characters, who transferred to Gensokyo from the Outside World relatively recently and are attempting to introduce more advanced technology like hydroelectric dams and even nuclear power. This isn't just for Gensokyo's advancement but because Kanako, one of the shrine's patron goddesses, wants to shift her godly domain to technology so she can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodsNeedPrayerBadly">get more worship</a>; she's also the one responsible for the aforementioned hell-crow. However, when they discuss this in one of the official manga, Kanako remarks that it'll take a few generations for any of their ideas (even lesser ones like a cable car) to be implemented. Nevertheless, by pooling together resources with the tengu and the kappa, she's able to successfully build her cable car just a few years later with a minimum of fuss; earlier, she was unable to execute the plan by herself.
</li></ul></li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TrailsSeries">Trails Series</a></em> Series. 1200 years ago the world was ruled by a civilization of advanced technology with airships, elemental powers, and left behind several artifacts of great power and utility after the Great Collapse. Society across Zemuria rebuilt itself after around 1200 years. The aversion comes when a scientist is able to reverse engineer artifacts and develops a new technology called Orbments, basically quartz crystal put into clockwork with different elemental properties. This single invention kickstarted the Orbal Revolution, allowing the creation of Orbal lightbulbs, working power grids, Orbal guns that shoot plasma, and phones, all within the span of 50 years. It's portrayed as chaotically and realistically as one might imagine as old middle-age maps are redrawn, several countries have urbanized their cities, warfare has changed entirely as a few well-trained Orbal users can level small armies with magic, and democracy and free thought have caught on, leaving nobles struggling to keep their power under outdated monarchies. The plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a></em> comes from the fact that the small country of Liberl has suddenly become incredibly important as they sit atop a wealth of Septium crystals for mining quartz, and the Erebonian Empire wants it, similar to the effects fossil fuels have in developing countries. Not only did the world go through the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution, but they did it in triple the speed, making it a very exciting time to live.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> On the one extreme, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurElvesAreDifferent">Night Elves</a> have existed in what seems to be a state of technological and societal stasis for <em>ten thousand years</em>. However, this is explicitly shown to be part of the (very conservative) race's way of life; a large segment of their population goes into otherworldly trances, sometimes for centuries at a time, and the remainder are so devoted to their sylvan ways that until recently they tended to disparage all technology or arcane magic. The fact that they were immortal at the time and this represented a single generation also contributed.
</li><li> And on the other extreme, the civilizations of capital city of Dalaran, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDemonsAreDifferent">Burning Legion</a>, the gnomes, the goblins, the high elves, and the draenei and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurAngelsAreDifferent">naaru</a> patrons all have access to exotic (and in the case of the gnomes, goblins, and dwarves, extremely quirky) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> technology.
</li><li> Last but certainly not least is the fact that many of these cultures, having allied and interacted, are beginning to pick up each other's tricks. This leads to some interesting interactions in the present, more internationalist era, such as an Alliance <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SteamPunk">Steampunk</a> airship, golems being produced like mass-produced robots, or a druid of the Cenarion Expedition excitedly studying super-advanced Ethereal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> for possible ecological renewal purposes.
</li><li> In <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, Garrosh Hellscream goes back in time and helps the Orcs of Draenor avert this by granting them a powerful artifact that kickstarts an industrial revolution. The new "Iron Horde" rejects the Fel magic that corrupted the original Horde in favor of the power of iron.

The world is largely dependent on Titan technology — that is, literally building mechanical attachments onto the living creatures to make transports, airships, and artillery platforms. It gets there using equipment brought up from the Cloud Sea by salvagers — nobody knows <em>how</em> salvaged stuff works, only that it does, and how to use it in their own creations.

However, Amalthus is also a giant hypocrite, as his egocentrism and god complex have him keeping the entire world dependent on an unsustainable resource he controls the distribution of.

It's suggested that the magic-using Creatures have suppressed technological development to prevent non-magical Beings from presenting a threat to them. It's also been hinted at as an "it doesn't work here anyway" situation, in the sense that the whole world is suffused with natural-law-disrupting magic. Jyrras, who has been pushing the envelope of technological development, had to first invent a very laborious, very slow, very expensive method for <em>removing</em> magic from materials before he could use the resulting metal to create the very-first firearm.

At one point, Gil showed his friend/rival Tarvek his prototype for heavier than air flying machine and he treated it like it was some type of evil magic. This is because the world is run by mad scientists who are more interested in making monsters and death rays than any form of practical technology, meaning the world hasn't had any real type of major advancements in centuries.

However, it is noted that the entire reason for the conflict was because humans wanted Gummi technology, which is quite advanced compared to what humans have.
<ul><li> In the course of the series, the Gummis are known more for their magical prowess and general cleverness, but two standout examples of their technology would be a human-sized, combat-capable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiniMecha">Mini-Mecha</a>, and the Gummiscope, which could be used as either a long-distance communication device (complete with an animatronic hand for transcribing the message on the receiving end!), or a colossal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathRay">Death Ray</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the flashbacks of Aang's three previous lives, which seems to span somewhere on the order of three or four hundred years, most of the world seems to have changed very little (Aang's outdated knowledge of slang aside). Even the Fire Nation, the setting's sole industrialized country, isn't completely immune; its ironclad steamships seen during the bulk of the series are virtually indistinquishable from the ones seen in flashbacks taking place <em>one hundred years ago</em>.
</li><li> We see some technological innovation over the course of the war (and the art book states that Zuko's own ship is quite old compared with the current Fire Nation standard), but the overall developmental pace over those hundred years still seems quite slow considering that the Fire Nation already had a 19th-century <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> level of technology; you'd expect the war to have accelerated the technological development of it and its opponents. Heck, even the innovations we do see were mostly created by just one inventor towards the end of the war. It's occasionally inverted in spectacular fashion; they went from capturing the burned-out wreckage of said inventor's prototype hot air balloon to deploying an entire fleet of massive battle zeppelines in a matter of <em>months</em>.
</li><li> Even if technology has been slow to change, <em>culture</em> has evolved over time. The Sun Warriors were apparently precursors to the present-day Fire Nation, and had similar but different architectural styles and a very different perception of fire. The Fire Nation itself used to be a theocracy ruled by the head Fire Sage, until one of those Fire Lords became the start of a monarchy. In Kyoshi's time the Earth Kingdom was apparently a collection of warring states with little respect for the Earth King in Ba Sing Se; even in Aang's time another city, Omashu, has its own king, and Kuei isn't particularly considered outside of his own city, wheras in Korra's time the monarch has enough power that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> her death</span> destabilizes the entire continent. Before Kuruk's time the Water Tribe was united in the north, then the Southern tribe seceded and built its own culture. The culture that seems to have changed least is the Air Nomads, who are clearly recognizable in Wan's time, even having similar tattoos. Given their Avatar statues they might have a collective interest in preserving and maintaining their history and way of life.

<ul><li> The flashbacks to Avatar Wan's time 10,000 years ago show a world that is clearly different from the world in both Aang's and Korra's time, but less different than would be expected for a 10,000 year gap.
</li><li> <em>Korra</em> averts the trope not only in terms of simple technology, but it also goes to great lengths to show cultural change. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The reformed Air Nation, being formed from people from several different nations who joined at various ages, are shown as being far less monastic than their Air Nomad predecessors, and much more active in world affairs. Also, head-shaving is far less common, and modern Airbenders have replaced their traditional clothes with wingsuits developed by Future Industries.</span>

Not only is it a Medieval society set seemingly in the Dark Ages, but it is surrounded by a layer of black clouds and all time literally stands still, along with technology failing to work.

</li><li> The series itself could count in a strange way. Due to many alien invasions, robot rebellions, wars with carrots, and brutal dictatorships, Earth has had many years of technological stagnation, and they still use the same technologies for over a thousand years (such as the suicide booths that advertise their use since 2008).

</li><li> Most versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em> take this to the extreme of nothing much changing over <em>millions</em> of years.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Trollz">Trollz</a></em>, Simon invokes this in the time travel arc. He sends Trollzopolis to the Middle Ages and plans to make sure it <em>stays</em> that way.

<ul><li> Averted one way or another in real life, every era and location on earth has been home to some scientific, legal, or social innovation however small. Even societies that actively attempted to invoke this trope never succeeded in doing much more than greatly slowing innovation and even then only regionally and not for very long.
</li><li> Averted in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>; the people of the Middle Ages certainly didn't think of themselves as living in stasis (or, indeed, in the 'middle' of anything). The Middle Ages saw a great deal of technological innovation. To name a few, the windmill, spectacles, sophisticated armour, three-crop rotation, the mechanical clock, gunpowder and the flying buttress all were medieval inventions.
<ul><li> During the Middle Ages art and architecture evolved from a Late Roman style to Romanesque to Gothic. By the High Middle Ages, fashion and design was very distinct from what was present after the Fall of Rome. For instance, Constantinople's Hagia Sophia was created in a revolutionary new architecture style, only sixty years after the Fall of Rome.
</li><li> However people in the Middle Ages also had a skewed view of the past, for example many Roman and Greek myths survived and were expanded upon, but with knights and castles added in. Similarly Medieval literature often portray mythological and historical figures as following a weird hybrid of Christianity and the Greek/Roman Pantheon. And in some of the Baltic states (which remained the most primitive region of Europe until the Teutonic Knights forcibly modernized the place), the old Norse and/or Slavic gods were still worshiped until the last medieval centuries, meaning that most of these countries were Catholic for only a few hundred years before Protestantism or Orthodoxy swept in. For all intents and purposes they thought the world had been as it was then since civilization picked up.
</li><li> Medieval art was an inversion. Later Medieval paintings of great battles such as the siege of Jerusalem in the First Crusade would often depict the armies in whatever the latest, most fashionable, and most advanced armor of the painter's time, leading to paintings of early Crusaders dressed in full plate mail armor instead of cloth and chainmail. Even early events, such as a painting from 1470 CE of the Siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar (a battle which took place in 587 BCE) showed the fighters dressed as knights riding on horses with full plate armor and lances.
</li><li> This is also why the popular images of Jesus, the saints, and many angels look suspiciously like Renaissance-era Italians both physically and in how they are dressed.
</li><li> Both may have an explanation other than the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanBrowned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanBrowned">author's own ignorance</a>, specially in the case of religious paintings which were intended for "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">mass consumption</a>" in churches (and not to sit in modern museums, as any guide will remind you). The paintings weren't there to look pretty, but to help parishioners visualize and memorize biblical stories and saints lives. This was easier and required less explanations if the characters in them dressed and looked like the viewers. This practice continued well after the Renaissance, as missionaries in other continents would represent the people of the Nativity scene in the local clothes and skin color despite this being obviously impossible. Colonial Peruvian art includes roasted guinea pigs in the Last Supper and gives the archangel Michael a gun instead of a sword, for instance. This is because Peruvians were more familiar with the former: swords were not used in the Inca Empire, and the typical Medieval sword was in decline in Europe when the Spanish conquest happened.
</li></ul></li><li> From the perspective of the <em>longue durée</em>, one can actually see the true medieval stasis to be...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic">The Roman Republic</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanEmpire">The Roman Empire</a>. For all its status in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NostalgiaFilter">early modern, enlightened and romantic imaginary as a modernizing and civilizing force in Europe</a>, there was nothing in terms of advancement in science and mathematics.
<ul><li> The great achievements of the Ancient World in mathematics and physics come from Egypt and Greece. The antique technology of later eras, the Antikythera Mechanism, the Baghdad Battery originated outside Rome. Meanwhile Caesar's invasion of Egypt resulted in the burning of the Library of Alexandria. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">Punic Wars</a> saw the death of Archimedes at the hands of a Roman legionary, since he, a Syracusan, fought on the side of Hannibal Barca. The Romans were brilliant engineers but they merely synthesized pre-existing works in engineering from the Etruscans<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8wx4f');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8wx4f" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8wx4f');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">whose writing if they knew or capable of deciphering, they did not choose to translate and maintain unlike the Ptolemaic-Greeks with their Rosetta Stone</span>, and their greatest and most enduring technical contribution, the Julian Calendar (later corrected to the modern Gregorian Calendar) came from their interaction with Egyptian astronomers.
</li><li> The Romans fascination for all things Greece led them to adopt the Aristotleian conception of physics for centuries, an attitude that Christians imbibed, and this put a stop to the natural development of the scientific method. Indeed, modern civilization actually revived during the so-called Dark Ages, first with the Viking invasions which revived trade routes across all of Europe, then the rise of the Arabs, the establishment of the House of Wisdom, and their spread of Indian mathematics westward, resulting in the formation of the universally used Arabic Numerals which Fibonacci introduced into the Western World in 1202, to replace the cumbersome Roman numeral system.
</li><li> The Romans were however great innovators when it came to legal matters. Many modern concepts of citizenship, republican government, individual rights of citizens and even what it means to be a state were originally codified by statesmen trying to resolve the various social conflicts of the Roman state. There's a reason that Latin is to Lawyers what Greek is to Scientists.
</li><li> The stasis of Imperial Rome can be compared to that of Imperial China, despite the apparent contradiction that many technological inventions happened there first. It wasn't unusual for those same technologies and other things like philosophy, medicine, bureaucracy or military doctrine to remain unchanged for hundreds of years after being adopted, or even millennia. China was so sure of its own superiority historically, that it was extremely reluctant to adopt the ways of foreigners (a.k.a "barbarians") until the Opium Wars showed them why they should.
</li></ul></li><li> Earth — Industrial technology has existed for at least 2500 years going back to Ancient Greece, but it wasn't till the end of the eighteenth century that one small, damp little island in the corner of Eurasia decided to do something with it.
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism">Antikythera Mechanism<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a good example of this.
<ul><li> The kicking off of an industrial revolution requires several complex factors, none of which Ancient Greece had.. To begin with, the place has to have basic law and order. It also has to make economic sense for people to invest in tools and machines to do things rather than just hiring (more) people and animals. Furthermore, people have to be able to get money to pay all these tools and machines — which means (easy-to-obtain) loans and institutions which can issue them at reasonable rates of interest. And that's just for efficient arable-<em>farming</em>, never mind the intricacies of manufacturing industries.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The political, social and technological organization of Japan remained the same from 1600 to 1853 — while the rest of the world changed — but this was mostly intentional, due to legally enforced restrictions (known in Japanese as the <em>Sakoku</em> or 'closed-nation' policy, though the term has fallen out of use in favour of 'isolationism'). The basic structure of Japanese society and state remained largely unchanged through the Feudal period, 1185-1868, though the 'warring states' period that immediately preceded the rise of the Tokugawa Shogunate saw a lot of (upward) social mobility.
<ul><li> By the time Commodore Perry arrived off what is now Tokyo Bay in 1853 however, there were at least a handful of changes from the days of Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Samurai in general had long turned into a landed peacetime caste, though their place in society was gradually being challenged by the merchant classes. With the exception of fringe and particularly stubborn clans, most were either allied to or puppets of the Shogunate. A fair bit of knowledge of the outside world filtered through the Ryukyus (that was technically an independent country<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note92ugs');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note92ugs" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note92ugs');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Ryukyu Kingdom was officially a vassal state of the Ming Dynasty of China and later the Qing Dynasty, that Japan did <em>not</em> want to provoke. When the Japanese Satsuma Domain invaded in 1609, the Qing Dynasty preparing a relief force was enough to get them to restore formal independence, but kept secretly controlling the Ryukyu Kingdom until the Meiji Restauration saw their formal annexation to Japan, leaving the Ryukyuans free to adopt outsider knowledge</span>) Tsushima, and the isle of Dejima (modern medicine and science being called "Dutch studies/learning", acquired as it was from contact with the Dutch trading post confined to Dejima Island in Nagasaki). This meant that while the Japanese didn't have the technology that showed up on their doorstep (i.e. the "Black Ships"), they knew <em>enough</em> for the better-informed among them to figure out just how far behind they were falling in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.
<ul><li> During the mid-sixteenth century the Japanese got a hold of two Portugese matchlock muskets and quickly figured out how to both mass produce them (it's estimated that pre-Tokugawa Japan had more firearms than existed in all of late-16th century Europe) and use them effectively in battle far before Europeans ever did. Unfortunately, they never improved on the design and when Europeans and Americans showed up in the mid-19th century with far more modern weapons, the Japanese were hopelessly outclassed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Amish deliberately shun most or all kinds of new technology due to religious beliefs and enforcing a strong belief in hard work as rewarding, instead electing to live a life that is not very different from the lives of those who lived around the 18th century or before that, on the whole. They do have contact with modern society, and some do use modern technology like tractors, but they mostly aim to be self-reliant and any use of modern technology is rare at best.
<ul><li> This will occasionally move into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchizoTech">Schizo Tech</a> territory, with motorized farm machinery mounted on a wooden platform and pulled by horses or sewing machines which are powered by a foot-operated treadle and controlled by mechanically linked dials and switches.
</li><li> The Amish value group effort when determining whether to use or avoid a piece of technology. Families are discouraged from using mechanical farming equipment in order to motivate them to work together in order to accomplish a harvest. In one case, a governing council actually <em>commanded</em> an elderly Amish farmer to purchase a tractor as his sons had moved out and he could no longer accomplish his harvest. The idea is that relying on the community discourages vanity and other sins.
</li><li> The Amish will use technology when required by the law — modern pasteurization for dairy products was the first example of this. Likewise, if you hire Amish for construction work and ask them to use power tools or supply them, they will use them without considering it a "sin."
<ul><li> Amish and similar groups are survivalists who don't want to be dependent on other people. They simply don't use technology they can't <em>reproduce themselves</em> but doing a job for someone else does not contradict this rule.
</li></ul></li><li> Interestingly, while a lot of people may be opposed to genetically modified food, the Amish love the idea of disease-resistant crops and eagerly grow them.
</li><li> And while the Amish may not use nor closely follow the latest in technology, they're hardly ignorant about it. They know what computers are and have a grasp of what sort of things they do — if an Amish person is injured and an ambulance takes them to a hospital, they will hardly be confused and think there's magic at work — they won't gasp in shock at a person's cellphone.
<ul><li> Children raised as Amish are actually expected to spend a few months living in the modern world upon reaching adulthood, so that if they do decide to commit to the Amish lifestyle, it's an informed choice.
</li><li> There is an Amish-run ice cream shop equipped to take not just credit and debit cards, but app-based payment methods like Apple Pay and Venmo.
</li></ul></li><li> Some Amish have started using solar panels in order to have electricity without needing to abandon their self-reliance.
</li><li> With the popularity of Amish furniture as being extremely well-crafted and durable, a few Amish businesses have devised absurdly clever "no-tech" ways to shuttle the <em>one</em> telephone they have between everyone in the building to handle business calls.
</li></ul></li><li> Believers in the Phantom Time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheory">Conspiracy Theory</a> argue (among other things) that little to no architectural evolution happened between the years 614 to 911 and take that as evidence that those years of European history are in fact fictitious and the work of Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, who wanted to be crowned around the year 1000, despite it only being the year 703.
<ul><li> There are many reasons why the PTH is ridiculous, not the least the fact that this supposedly "unchanged" intermediate time saw the rise and expansion of Islam, the Islamic Golden Age, the entire history of the Carolingian Empire and its own (Carolingian) Renaissance, and the birth of the Papacy as a political power, among others.
</li></ul></li><li> We all do this from a psychological standpoint in our heads. It's why we are always so surprised upon returning to our "old neighborhood where nothing ever changed" and finding trees cut down or grown larger, neighbors having moved on or passed away, houses painted differently, etc. It's not that we don't expect things to change, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TethercatPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TethercatPrinciple">it's just that the human brain isn't usually thinking about how things may be changing</a> back in or old neighborhood as we move on-we're just busy with our lives where we live <em>now</em>, and so <em>our memory</em> of our old neighborhood goes into a medieval stasis of sorts.
</li><li> The first thing a student of any discipline dealing with the past should learn, be it History, Archaeology or Paleontology, is that people have a natural tendency to see "the past" as simpler and shorter than it was. Just look at pages like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnachronismStew">Anachronism Stew</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyThink">Older Than They Think</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewerThanTheyThink">Newer Than They Think</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrieferThanTheyThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrieferThanTheyThink">Briefer Than They Think</a>.
</li><li> There are, even today, a number of isolated societies that have never gone beyond a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, for the simple reason that the regions they live in lack native animal and plant species that can easily be domesticated in order to facilitate a shift to herding or agriculture and in most cases those areas are also not conductive of farming or herding anyway due to lack of rainfall or other factors (which is why some other group that did practice herding or agriculture never bothered to come and take the land).
</li><li> During the union times, and before modern communication and roads, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Norway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Norway">Norway</a> came out as incredibly stable. Firearms aside, the farmlands continued to work out things after medieval fashion for centuries. Thus, iron age attitudes lasted among them all the way to 1830. In some remote areas, a proper country road or a railway was the changing factor. Natural household, as opposed to money household, was the rule rather than not in the period, as were the use of the old norse <em>thing</em> to settle disputes.
</li><li> For the overwhelming majority of human existence, as "modern humans" and before, humanity used stone tools. Copper, bronze, iron, steel and more advanced technologies came in "the last 5 minutes" or so of our species' "technological clock".
<ul><li> The trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAdvanceSwiftly">Humans Advance Swiftly</a> is very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>. Before the "mental revolution" in African <em>Homo sapiens</em> about 70,000 years ago, it was <em>the norm</em> for lithic industries to remain unchanged for hundreds of thousands of years, even as their makers evolved in completely new biological species.
</li><li> Oldowan or "Mode I" tools were used both by <em>Homo habilis</em>, who was little more than a glorified <em>Australopithecus</em>, and the much more human-like <em>H. ergaster</em> in Africa and <em>H. erectus</em> in Eurasia. They appeared 2.6 million years ago and were phased out 1.7 million years ago, 900,000 years later.
</li><li> Acheulean or "Mode II" tools were used from 1.7 million years ago to only 130,000 years ago in Africa. This makes its main development, the hand-axe, the longest used tool in all of human history.
</li><li> Mousterian or "Mode III" tools were used by the Neanderthals of Europe from 160,000 to 40,000 years ago. A brief, enigmatic new technology known as Chatelperronian (45,000 — 40,000 years ago) has been interpreted as Neanderthal attempts to imitate the Aurignacian or "Mode IV" used by newly arrived <em>H. sapiens</em>. If true, this means Neanderthals were smart enough to realize their technology was outclassed upon meeting <em>H. sapiens</em>, yet it didn't occur to them to improve on their technology before that.
</li></ul></li><li> Finland was hit with this after being conquered by Russia. Alexander I allowed autonomy to Finland, but every change had to be approved by him. After the Diet of Porvoo Finland remained in the 18th century for <em><strong>fifty years</strong></em>.
