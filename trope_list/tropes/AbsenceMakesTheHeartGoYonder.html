However, sometimes this is actually quite hard to accomplish, especially in the case of someone believing their lover will never come back, or that they are dead. But unexpectedly, their lover comes back to them, and they are happily reunited.
</p><p>Or they would be, if it weren't for a little problem  they didn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWillWaitForYou">wait</a>.

Minmay's feelings for him, on the other hand, never diminished during his absence.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SevenSeeds">7 Seeds</a></em> seems to be playing with the idea of subverting this, but also playing it straight on the emotional side. Hana and Arashi are a couple and have been placed in separate Teams for the project and, upon learning that the other is alive and part of the project, finding each other is their personal goal. While Arashi seems resolutely having his heart set on Hana, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousToLove">despite Natsu being obviously in love with him but him not noticing</a>, Hana seems to be more inclined to liking Aramaki.

It's actually far more heartwarming than it sounds, as given how things ultimately turned out, the most probable reason for why they did so was to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ensure that even if they passed away, they'd have descendants to make sure that Watanuki's never alone</span>.
</li><li> Completely subverted in regards to Watanuki's feelings for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Yuuko</span>.

She was gone long enough that Robin's relationship with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Cassie</a> had both come and gone, but at the time of her return Tim was dating Zoanne, a normal girl at his high school, and she took it quite well, acknowledging that it was her fault for disappearing. She and Tim managed to remain friends and crimefighting partners as he stayed with Zoanne. Of course, then a new creative team came on board; Steph was ordered by Batman to betray Tim to a villain to help "make him a better Robin", in the process entirely ruining her friendship with him. Very shortly after Tim then finally hit the end of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaCongaLine">Trauma Conga Line</a> that his life had turned into ever since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IdentityCrisis">Identity Crisis</a></em> and Steph's faked death, had what can only be described as a complete nervous breakdown, and in the process of cutting himself off from any and all beneficial human contact, Tim broke up disastrously with Zoanne. And so the whole point was rendered spectacularly moot.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheBatmanAdventures">The Batman Adventures</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a>. According to <em>The New Batman Adventures</em> episode "Cold Comfort", after Nora Fries was cured of her terminal illness, she waited for her missing and presumed dead husband Victor Fries for some time before she gave up waiting, marrying her doctor Francis D'Anjou and leaving Gotham for good. This was expanded in <em>Batman: Gotham Adventures</em> #5, <em>Batman: Gotham Adventures</em> #51, and <em>Batman Adventures</em> #15. In <em>Batman: Gotham Adventures</em> #5 Mr. Freeze teams up with Robin, Nightwing and Batgirl to rescue Francis because he cares about her happiness; after Francis is save and Freeze escapes, Francis reveals that Nora still loves him. <em>Batman: Gotham Adventures</em> #51 shows that Mr. Freeze has been sending letters to Nora asking to see her one more time, but that Francis has been hiding all the letters. The issue ends with Mr. Freeze leaving for the Arctic, accepting that Nora does not want anything to do with him, as Nora arrives at Arkham Asylum asking for him. In <em>Batman Adventures</em> #15, Francis, jealous of Nora's feelings for Victor, frames him for attacking him by having a robot freeze him, hoping to convince her to see Victor as a monster. Nora refuses to believe that Victor was behind the attack and leaves for the Arctic to find him. Victor confirms that he was not responsible, and that he would never hurt Francis because she loves him. Nora wants to believe him and admits she does not love Francis, and is not sure she ever did, as she embraces him. Batman and Batgirl arrive to apprehend Victor, who chooses to fight back, thinking Batman will arrest him for his other crimes even if he isn't responsible for Francis' attack. During their fight, Batman causes Victor's suit to overload, which leaves his head to fall into the Arctic Ocean, devastating Nora. After learning the truth, Nora leaves Francis in prison. After Nora talks with Victor's former assistant Koonak, Nora returns to the Arctic, hoping to find Victor's head. It's implied that she never found him and spends her whole life looking for him. So because she understandably tried to move on with her life, Nora separated from Victor again, and what makes it worse is Victor did not come to see her because his condition has completely destroyed his body and he believes he can never be with her, when in fact Nora does not care and still loves him.
</li></ul></li><li> Prior to dating Tim, Cassandra "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderGirl">Wonder Girl</a>" Sandsmark had been with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy1994" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy1994">Superboy</a>, who died. Tim and Cassie had a brief relationship (which could be interpreted as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexForSolace">Sex for Solace</a> without having ever gone as far as sex), then break up. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsCheap">Then Superboy comes back from the dead</a>.

One year and a lot of adventurers later he finally meets up with his dear sweetheart, Beth... only to find out that she had intended to break up with him during that phone call one year ago, because her heart had gone yonder during his absence. Not only that, but she had realized that she was actually in love with Yorick's sister!

This is a particularly painful one because both the husband and the new guy are focus characters, so we get to spend the entire time the husband is making his slow, tortuous journey back home knowing exactly what's waiting for him, and that things will get very bad when he finishes his quest. Turtledove eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">has him go nuts and get himself killed</a> to resolve the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>.
<ul><li> In another Turtledove example, in the timeline-191 series, Jefferson Pinkard is drafted to go fight in WWI. When he finally gets leave, he finds his wife in bed with his old steel-mill buddy, who came home from the trenches short an arm. He forgives her, largely due to his own transgressions at whorehouses near the front. After the war, the sorry state of the Confederacy drives him to the Freedom Party. His absence leads his wife back to the steel-mill buddy. These betrayals are a big part of what turns him on to the path that ends in his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> execution for crimes against humanity during the "population reduction."</span>

Definitely doesn't forget about #2 (who was presumed dead) when she went back to #1, but felt guilty for wanting to be with #2 when #1 still existed in his own timeline alive and well.
<ul><li> It applies even better to Jamie's activities in the 20 years Claire spent in the 20th century. He has a couple flings, one resulting in a child, and even gets married to a widow who once tried to have Claire killed as a witch.

Then, Garion get swept up in this whole 'save the world from an evil god' quests, leaving the farm behind, and quickly maturing into a bona-fide, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicKnight">Magic Knight</a>-style hero. Then, 'bout halfway through his quest, the party swings by the old farm, and he finds that his friend married the girl... said friend, however, is terribly impressed with Garion's new heroic profile, and apologizes for snatching up the girl in his absence... and the girl is both ready and eager to dump him to run off with the new and improved Garion, too.

<ul><li> There's also that if Garion doesn't marry the princess, a centuries-old treaty will be voided and the resulting diplomatic disaster will irreparably sunder the armies of the West at just the exact time all goodly nations need to unify to avoid being crushed by said evil god. Add in that Garion <em>is</em> falling genuinely in love with Ce'Nedra and vice versa, and that Zubrette's life expectancy would be measured in days if she tried to share the rigors of the quest with Garion, and, well, who can blame him for not wanting to ruin her marriage and then end her life in the same month.

It's also specifically stated to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexlessMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexlessMarriage">Sexless Marriage</a>.
</li><li> This is Ron's main fear in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> following graduation. Since Kim was getting hundreds of college acceptance letters while he wasn't getting any at all, he was worried that the separation would lead to a break up. Whether they go to college together or not isn't revealed, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> confirms that no matter what, their relationship will endure and flourish.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles">Gargoyles</a>,</em> it's implied that Una may have had a thing for Griff, who vanished and was presumed dead during the Blitz. The tie-in comic reveals that she eventually wound up with Leo instead.

<ul><li> Dogs avoid this trope, due to their inability to tell time. They are always most excited to see you when you return, as they have no idea if minutes or days have passed.
</li><li> On a particular episode of Dr. Phil was about a soldier in Iraq who was counted for dead, and then his wife went on to marry his best friend. Needless to say the fellow turned out to be alive and returned home to an unwelcome surprise. Cue the Dr. Phil theme.
</li><li> There's a couple stories floating around about men who went off to fight in wars (most notably, the Mexican-American War) with their girlfriends promising to wait, and when they get back, they find out their girlfriend... didn't. Usually by walking in on their girlfriend and her lover.
<ul><li> War is not even a necessary prerequisite. At least in Russia the (lack of) commitment of girls waiting for their drafted boyfriends to return from the service (two years until recently and one year now) is a common topic of drama both in fiction and in real life. More often than not it can turn ugly, as the thoughts of their betrothed ones are usually among the few things that keep the conscript's spirit high throughout the army hardships and a sudden hammer slam of a letter saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveWaitedLongEnough" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveWaitedLongEnough">I Have Waited Long Enough</a>" can become that last straw that breaks the camel's back and lead to violent or suicidal behavior. Sometimes they desert and venture to "sort the things out." Sometimes they take their guns with them.
</li><li> In the American military, this trope is made light of with Jodies, marching songs named for Jody, the hypothetical man back home who is no doubt doing the deed to your woman, so obviously there's no reason for you to worry about leaving the military to get back home anymore. Jokes aside, divorce rates amongst military members is far out of proportion to the civilian population, due to various combinations of the partner back home or the partner deployed abroad (it's not just the civilian who might be prone to wandering) not staying faithful, combined with the repeated strain of long-distance relationships due to military deployments.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20100721/eu-poland-escape-from-auschwitz/">There was a young man in World War II<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who freed his Jewish girlfriend from the camps by pretending to be a Nazi soldier. However, they got separated while they were trying to get out of the country. Neither waited for the other, and both got married. When they finally met up again as old folks, her husband had died but his wife had not. In a rare show of honor for this type of story (usually, in fiction at least, the old lovers get back together no matter what), the guy wouldn't leave his wife for his old flame, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMourningAfter">she died never talking to him again</a>.
</li><li> Not uncommon with slavery. Since people could be sold away at any time and for any reason, you could absolutely be separated from your spouse or your children for the rest of your life. Which could lead to tragedies like <a class="urllink" href="http://www2.uncp.edu/home/berrys/courses/hist310/hist310_docs_slavery_3.html">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where people gave up and started new families, and could not reunite with each other even after they became free.

A subtrope involves a young man going on an adventure in order to impress the object of his affections, and returning to find that she's become engaged, or even married, while he was away. (Often her choice will demonstrate that what <em>really</em> impresses her is a man with a steady job who can be relied on to stay by her instead of disappearing off on adventures.)
<p></p><h2>Examples:</h2>
<p></p><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostWorld1912" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLostWorld1912">The Lost World (1912)</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArthurConanDoyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>: The narrator joined Professor Challenger's expedition because his young lady said she could only marry a heroic man of action. When he eventually returns he finds she's married to a solicitor's clerk.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitchesOfKarres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWitchesOfKarres">The Witches of Karres</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHSchmitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHSchmitz">James H. Schmitz</a>: At the start of the book, Pausert is engaged. When his ship returns after his first encounter with the people of Karres, he finds that not only is he in trouble with the law, his fiancee married someone else almost as soon as he left.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stardust">Stardust</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman">Neil Gaiman</a>. Which is a subversion within a subversion. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Tristran, the adventurer, fell in love with Yvaine during his journey and was no longer in love with Victoria, the object of his affections, when he came back to see her.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlandersAndSwann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FlandersAndSwann">Donald Swann</a> performed a song called <em>The Youth Of The Heart</em> on this theme: the singer's girlfriend wants to marry him, but he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnableToSupportAWife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnableToSupportAWife">wants to be financially secure first</a> and travels to America to seek his fortune. He returns, having saved enough money, to find that she married someone else a few hours before.
</li><li> The song "The Errant Apprentice" by Bill Watkins and Andy M. Stewart is a comical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiLoveSong">Anti-Love Song</a>, in which the girl tells the singer she'll love him if he becomes a soldier, and then gets married while he's fighting in the Boer War.
</li></ul><ul><li> Karim of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em> is tasked by Chandra to retrieve an ancient treasure if he wants any chance of her love. However, when he speaks with her later, she admits that he was gone on his quest so long that she gave herself to a nobleman. However, the nobleman's mistress didn't take kindly to this... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Chandra was dragged from her bed and murdered.

A man asks his girlfriend to give him a quest to prove his love. After he refuses to kill a panda for her, her second suggestion is that he can go to the Arctic Circle for ten years, and when he returns, if she's still unmarried, he may claim her as his bride.
<div class="indent"><strong>Man</strong>: <em>If</em> you remain unmarried?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Woman</strong>: It's your quest, not mine. You might die out there! I'd look pretty silly then, if I'd waited.
