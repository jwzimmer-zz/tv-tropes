At one point, Youko's consciousness is sucked into the blade, where she <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">meets the spirit of the sword in the shape of a talking monkey who tries to corrupt her into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>. She must beat him in a dialectical duel to break the psychic entrapping, return to her body and (finally) gain full control of the sword.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheBigO">The Big O</a></em> plays with this trope a lot.
<ul><li> Roger Smith's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> locks up on him in combat more than once as a direct result of his emotional state.
</li><li> When Alan Gabriel tries to use another mech for nefarious purposes, it outright murders him in particularly nightmare-inducing scene, even if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire">sicko</a> did deserve it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a></em>:
<ul><li> More Gundams do this sort of thing than you'd think. Though it's either Retconned or handwaved away, oftentimes many Gundams somehow respond to their pilot's emotional state. Examples include the Zeta Gundam powering up to destroy the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, or the Nu Gundam's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">psychoframe technology suddenly creating a large psychic wave and sacrificing itself (and presumably the pilot) to prevent Earth from being hit with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">Colony Drop</a></span>. The titular mech of <em>Gundam 00</em> activates itself based on what appears to be Setsuna's <strike><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove">Power of Love</a></strike> persuasive argument to do so. The Unicorn Gundam shuts down on its own when Banagher is crying, but once he decides to fight, it activates on its own, and on occasions it has activated its NT-D when Banagher wants it to.
</li><li> The Gundams of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam">G Gundam</a></em> all tend to have an empathic component, which is required to use their full strength.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamWing">Mobile Suit Gundam Wing</a></em>, most of the characters talk to their mecha, though it could be for other reasons. You also have the case of when Quatre activates the Sandrock's self-destruct with the intent of sacrificing himself with it. Sandrock then opens its chest with the implication being that it wants him to survive, before walking towards the enemy on its own so Quatre can get away. Then there is Duo's Deathscythe when it is heavily damaged in space; Duo attempts to hit the self-destruct button, but as he is not wearing a spacesuit to get out, it just plain refuses to work.
</li><li> Where other Gundam shows leave it ambiguous, the Universal Century series make it clear that the entire point behind Psycommu Systems like the Biosensor or Psychoframe is to turn mobile suits into this for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">Newtype</a> pilots. Since its introduction in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitZetaGundam">Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam</a></em> the technology has been refined and enhanced, starting with Kamille and Judau being able to give their machines a power-boost, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamCharsCounterattack">Amuro</a> being able to directly control his Nu Gundam with thoughts alone (to the point where stray thoughts can make him lose control of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackDrones">Funnels</a>), and finally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamUnicorn">Banagher</a>, who's able to take this to its logical conclusion by being able to control the Unicorn and its Funnel-Shields even when he's not inside the machine.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceRunawayIdeon">Space Runaway Ideon</a></em>, though the title robot itself is not sentient, the strange energy that powers it (called Ide) has a will of its own, and though it is never seen or technically communicated with, the show's cast know when it has been angered or has decided to forsake them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Shinigami all have an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a> that is born from their own souls and imprinted onto an Asauchi, which is a blank slate with limitless potential. As the Shinigami bonds with the Asauchi, the Asauchi takes on the form of the Shinigami's soul power in the form of a Zanpakutou. Only the most talented Shinigami can realise this process to such a degree that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">Empathic Weapon</a> fully awakens into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">Talking Weapon</a>. If the sword breaks in battle, it can heal itself afterwards if given enough time. However, if the sword breaks while in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">bankai</a>, the weapon can never be restored to its original form. The only exception is believed to be Komamura's. At one point, the villainous Pepe Waccabrada points out that since Zanpakutou are sentient, they are vulnerable to his Love ability. He makes Byakuya's sword Senbonzakura fall in love with him, to the point it jumps out of Byakuya's hand and attacks him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em> has the swords of the Magic Knights. As their spirits and convictions mature, so do their weapons (and their armor as well, for that matter).

Stronger-willed and more aggressive people use their kudan to fight each other. Unsurprisingly, both the protagonist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellMyNameWithAnS">Syaoran</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">tough guy Kurogane</a> get kudan that take the form of weapons, although they don't get to take the weapons with them when they leave.
</li><li> The legendary Maou's sword "Morgif" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KyoKaraMaoh">Kyo Kara Maoh!</a></em> is supposed to be a powerful weapon in tune with its wielder, but because Yuuri's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde">demon king side</a> is usually sealed, all it does for him is groan a bit.

<ul><li> The Nirvash type ZERO mech; Eureka frequently communicates with it and says that it has feelings, although Renton seems unable to perceive or understand these things. Further it reacts to Renton's emotions and his desire to protect Eureka. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end of the series, it's revealed that Nirvash is actually a sentient being, and experiencing Renton and Eureka's love for one another helps it reach enlightenment and prevent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">The End of the World as We Know It</a>.</span>

</li><li> The Nirvash requires its pilot(s) to have confidence in themselves and in it; in the <em>New Wave</em> PS2 game, military pilot-turned rebel Sumner Sturgeon could not get it to start until he said that he believed he could.

</li><li> Sakura's holy sword Arataka is also like this. It won't allow anyone unworthy to wield it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Akatsuki member Kisame Hoshigaki wields Samehada, a living, shark-skinned sword which <em>eats</em> chakra and <em>visibly digests it</em>. Also, if anyone other than Kisame tries to grab the handle, it skewers their hands with spikes. Its full form steps right into terror as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it starts making noises, grows at least double its previous size and a mouth grows near the tip of the sword and <em>starts drooling</em></span>. In chapter 472 <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it rebels against Kisame. Apparently it likes the Hachibi's chakra so much that it doesn't want him and his chakra to disappear. Later this turns out to be a ploy, but it still did something it wasn't supposed to. And it goes back to the Hachibi's host <em>again</em> at the first opportunity, leaving Kisame to fight (and lose to) Might Guy without its assistance. It turns out that when your sword decides it likes your enemy better than it likes you, you're in trouble. Imagine that.</span>

</li><li> The Seventh Holy Scripture from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em>, a humongous harpoon gun thing that fires bible scriptures (... as spears, okay?) to stop reincarnations. It's powered by the soul of a young medieval girl crossed with the horn of a unicorn. Generally, it's called Nana (7 in Japanese) until Arihiko renames it Nanako. Oddly enough for this sort of thing, it's definitely its bearer who has the upper hand here, because Nanako is terrified of her.

<ul><li> Tessaiga and Tenseiga both have consciousness and a will of their own, most evident in Sesshoumaru's interactions with both swords. He loathes Tenseiga for being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingShiv">Healing Shiv</a> that can't cut anything and covets Inuyasha's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Tessaiga</a> instead, but Tenseiga freely protects him anyway and often prompts him to use its healing power. Tessaiga is less assertive but prompts Inuyasha the same way when necessary. On one occasion, both swords even <em>work together</em> to nudge their two stubborn masters into cooperation, a phenomenon which Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru end up calling "Resonance." Sesshoumaru unhappily interprets it as a sign that Tenseiga is Tessaiga's slave. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It actually means that Tenseiga is Tessaiga's <em>guide,</em> which is the role their father intended for Sesshoumaru to play for Inuyasha.</span>
</li><li> Along the same lines, Sango's boomerang Hiraikotsu is inhabited by the souls of several demons whose bones were used to make the boomerang, giving it its own degree of sentience. At one point <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the demons actually become rather cross with her and refuse to help her because she sacrificed Hiraikotsu in order to save Miroku</span>.
</li><li> Sesshoumaru's <em>other</em> sword, Toukijin, has its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">evil</a> will and takes control of the body of the smith who forged it by sheer force of malice. The terrible amount of malice and evil power contained within it allows it to animate its creator's corpse even after Miroku kills him and not even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith">Ultimate Blacksmith</a> Toutousai can get close to the sword later on to negate its power. However, Sesshoumaru is so much more powerful (and strong-willed) that he completely represses Toukijin's will when he takes possession of it, and the sword's will is therefore never again an issue.
</li><li> In the third movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYashaTheMovieSwordsOfAnHonorableRuler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYashaTheMovieSwordsOfAnHonorableRuler">Swords of an Honorable Ruler</a></em>, it's revealed that Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's father had a third sword, Sōunga, called by Toutousai "the sword of hell," which is so evil it turns Inuyasha full demon, then finds, resurrects, and control's the man who killed Inuyasha's father, and tries to open the portal to hell just out of spite.

The reason Shinji is selected as the pilot for Eva 01?

Equipment-types are slow to respond while Parasite-types <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and Crystal-types</span> react much faster. Sentient Innocence are rare, with only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedRightHand">Allen's Crowned Clown</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithMonkeys">Klaud Nine's Lau Jimin</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">Cardinal/Apocryphos</a></span> being known to have sentience.
</li><li> The Master Key from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TenchiMuyo">Tenchi Muyo!</a></em> is quite fussy about who is allowed to wield it. Anyone unsuitable gets a painful electric shock. In one case, when the unsuitable wielder insists on holding on, the jolt got so powerful that it <em>blew up his hand</em>. He promptly grew a new one, but it did stop him from stealing it.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrettySammy">Pretty Sammy</a></em>, Sammy's baton is shown to have a will of its own whenever it gets separated from her. When Haida ends up with it, it tries to direct her behavior towards being a paragon of justice while she just uses her powers for selfish reasons.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrainPowerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BrainPowerd">Brain Powerd</a></em>, the Brains are organic and intelligent, and their pilots tend to do more guiding, training and ordering than piloting in the traditional sense. At least for newborn Brains; most of them are outfitted with a cockpit at the first opportunity. Still, it's possible for a Brain to get angry or rattled in battle and do something stupid, at which point the pilot's job is supposedly to <em>scold</em> it.

Thankfully, they had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheDog">Boota...</a>

</li><li> The Buster Machines from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DieBuster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DieBuster">DieBuster</a></em> are an extreme version of this, as not only do they "talk" to their pilots, but they actually <em>outlast</em> them; to a Buster Machine, the pilot is little more than a battery, and the oldest Buster Machine, Dix-Neuf, has had <em>dozens</em> of pilots in its lifetime.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilentMobius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilentMobius">Silent Möbius</a></em>: Grospoliner, Gesso, and Medium are examples of this trope. Of these, only Grospoliner is heard to speak to anyone other than its wielder, and Medium is an evil sword capable of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicPossession">possessing</a> its wielder.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Cloths</a> of Athena's Saints in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SaintSeiya">Saint Seiya</a></em> have a will of their own. Those who wear them must first prove themselves worthy of the honor, and they must make <em>some</em> effort of upholding Athena's ideals (such as when a Gold Cloth outright <em>abandoned</em> its master in the middle of a battle.) The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicFlail">Andromeda Chain</a> takes this one step further, as it can sense and attack a source of danger long before its wielder does, sometimes <em>against</em> said wielder's intentions.

More importantly, the mech's Lambda Driver superweapon runs off of Sōsuke's own emotions and aggressive impulses.

It also has beyond godlike power and a tendency to try and be helpful, whether by giving suggestions (responding with instructions to Garion's offhand, sardonic comment about writing his name in the stars) or just being overenthusiastic. Case in point: Garion uses the Orb to knock down a city's gates as a distraction. Said gates (and part of the surrounding walls) are suddenly blasted miles away into the ocean. A little while after acquiring it, he contemplates the "damaged" world and how to fix it. The Orb promptly starts feeding him instructions on how to REBUILD THE WHOLE WORLD.

They also happen to be the most powerful weapons known (on special occasions), with the possible exception of the Black Athame. They don't appear to be sentient in of themselves, but are often used as a conduit by anything up to an Archangel/God himself (that incident at the end of Changes is a bit ambiguous as to which Judaeo-Christian higher being it was), and each chooses their new wielder, often in fairly spectacular fashion.

Since accidently absorbing the essence of a Shade Charon's Claw has developed a "Liking" to him, and resists even more than usual anyone who tries to wield it. So far the only people other than Entreri who can use it are an epic-level monk, a Netherese lord, and Drizzt Do'Urden. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In its last appearance, it seems to act a lot like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The One Ring</a>, in that it attempts to corrupt its carrier, causes him to be possessive towards the sword, and is destroyed by being thrown into a volcano despite attempts by its former owners to reclaim it and gain in power.</span>

</li><li> Ovinrbaane is a cursed greatsword that attempts to trick its wielders into thinking that they're its original wielder, a barbarian warlord named Armag, and that everyone they see is an enemy that needs to be destroyed. Further, Ovinrbaane gradually transforms its wielder into a perfect copy of the long-dead Armag, in an effort to recreate the one it perceives as its true master.

See <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oN0IlOcBykQ">this clip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> And then there's the Masou Kishin machines, giant mecha hailing from a techno-slash-fantasy-medieval land, which as quoted by legends function as chariots by a patron elemental god. Their level of empathy is mostly left in the air, however.
</li><li> The Mechanoids also are mostly requested by their pilots to perform their attacks than "piloted"to do so. Justified in that they have a mind and even a voice of their own, and that their power output is highly dependent of the pilot's willpower.
</li><li> Speaking of which, every pilot has indeed a "Will" statistic representing fighting spirit that modifies his or her robot's stats and determines what attacks it can use. Depressed pilots deal less damage, take more, and can only use basic weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> The Masamune in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em> and <em>Chrono Cross</em>. Also the Einlanzer, to a less extent, in the second game.
</li><li> Asgard from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WildARMs">Wild ARMs</a></em> activates only when Cecilia shows understanding of its purpose and reluctance to fulfill that purpose. Cecilia also shows respect for it by asking it for help rather than forcefully controlling it. To a minor degree, the titular ARMs of the series also qualify, as they're usually portrayed as only usable by certain people who have the capacity to attune their bodies and spirits to them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Suikoden">Suikoden</a></em> uses this trope quite a lot:
<ul><li> All the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">True Runes</a> are implied to choose their own bearer.
</li><li> Every gun in the setting is also implied to have a soul, and may refuse to work for people who don't have the "right" to operate them.
</li><li> The Star Dragon Sword has a significantly abrasive personality, and often disagrees with its' wielder. You have to <em>fight</em> it in the second game before you can use it.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>
<ul><li> Sora's Keyblade is very particular over who wields it, and will normally teleport itself back into his hands if held by anyone else. This is used humorously in the second game when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PiratesOfTheCaribbean">Jack Sparrow</a> asks for the Keyblade as payment. Sora willingly hands it over to him only for it to return to Sora a second later. He can also summon it back to him if it's knocked out of his hands, as seen in his dream-fight against Roxas. If he doubts himself, the Keyblade won't stick around, as seen at Hollow Bastion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em> reveals that the ownership of a Keyblade <em>can</em> be transferred, but only to other worthy wielders, as seen when Riku gives a Destiny's Embrace Keyblade to Kairi.
</li><li> Roxas and Xion have a pair that get passed around a bit, Xion borrowing Roxas's a couple times, Riku taking Xion's a couple times, and finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Roxas taking Xion's and wielding it along with his own before Riku takes it back <em>again</em></span>... and it all makes sense in context.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsBirthBySleep">Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep</a></em> sort-of clarifies the process. Sometimes the Keyblade is passed down (Yen Sid giving Mickey the Star Seeker), while in other cases, existing Keyblade wielders can grant the same power to those with strong enough hearts (Terra to Riku, Aqua to Kairi).
</li><li> Data-Sora, the manifestation of Sora as recorded in Jiminy's (digitized) first journal in <em>Re:coded</em>, was supplied with a programmed replica of the Keyblade for use in the Datascape. That imitation Keyblade was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">later shattered by Maleficent, only to be replaced by an authentic one responding to Data-Sora's genuine experiences with Mickey &amp; friends.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Blackrock Sword from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UltimaVII">Ultima VII</a></em> and its <em>The Black Forge</em> expansion. The sword is only usable because of a demon sealed in the hilt of the sword, making it perhaps the ultimate tool in the entire game. This sword can instantly recharge the player's mana, instantly kill any enemy in one swipe, can provide hints for the player (by "talking" to the sword). In the sequel, you cannot escape the starting area without shattering the gem holding the demon, rendering the sword useless, in the spirit of starting with nothing.
<ul><li> The sword is actually lost at the beginning of the game, and recovered about halfway through the game. You get the awesome power of the sword for approximately <em>five minutes</em> before it becomes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a>. You can eventually repair the weapon, but it never becomes as powerful as it was before.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkCloud">Dark Cloud</a></em>, one of the weapons you can find is a talking slingshot named Steve, who gives advice about any monster you aim at, as well as talking about other unrelated things, such as his mother being a catapult, and he seems to have a crush on his owner, Xiao. He can be upgraded just like most other weapons... to <em>Super Steve</em>, which bears very little aesthetic change, apart from the cape adoring the human-shaped slingshot handle. And yes, it still talks.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Awakening</a></em> expansion to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>, the sword Vigilance is implied to be this in the epilogue.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries">Soul Calibur</a></em> series of games features a few empathic weapons, all of which are (one way or another) the result of direct or indirect contact with the main evil one:
<ul><li> Although much closer to an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Artifact of Doom</a></em>, Soul Edge is a fully sentient weapon that seeks to control its wielder into killing people so it can eat the souls and gain power. The sword has an actual soul/mind (Inferno) and can communicate to its wielder mentally, usually to harass or demoralize him/her. It can also form into any weapon the wielder is most familiar with when held.
</li><li> Soul Calibur was originally a bit emphatic, merely choosing to protect its wielder from Soul Edge and help fight it. <em>IV</em> and <em>V</em>, however, saw the sword go through considerable development: <em>IV</em> revealed it to actually be a purified shard of Soul Edge itself with an opposed but extreme goal to achieve peace and order by freezing the world in crystals. In <em>V</em>, it becomes the driving force for Patroklos when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his older sister Pyrrha is manipulated into becoming the next wielder for Soul Edge</span>. Though apparent in <em>IV</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it becomes clear that Soul Calibur herself can be just as bad as Soul Edge since she is only concerned with killing Soul Edge and its wielder and possesses Patroklos and removes his empathy to become an unfeeling and loyal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>.</span> Also, much like Soul Edge, it changes shape to accomodate her wielder.
</li><li> Ivy's sword, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhipSword">Valentine</a>, is described as sentient, having been (unknowingly, at the time) animated by the evil energy of Soul Edge. It has a mind of its own and will protect Ivy from any harm, as shown in her ending during <em>IV</em>, where the sword shatters itself to protect Ivy from the evil of Soul Edge when the sword was destroyed.
</li><li> Taki's second sword, Mekki-Maru, is somewhat empathic as it was also affected by a shard of the sword forged into it. It reacts strongly to the sword's energy and other similar emanations.
</li><li> Yoshimitsu's self-named katana gains some sentience as well, once again due to its proximity to Soul Edge's aura. It feeds on the negative emotions of its wielder, slowly gnawing at their life. As it fed of Yoshimitsu's desires for revenge, he found a way to keep the sword in check, but since his successor (who's similarly furious at his mentor's killer) is incapable of doing it, he needs a second sword that palliates the effects of the first as a (temporal) failsafe.
</li></ul></li><li> The above weapon is seemingly the same one used by the modern-times Yoshimitsu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>, whose katana is described as turning its wielder crazy if it's not used to kill (bad) guys.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/BaldursGate">Baldur's Gate</a></em>
<ul><li> Yoshimo's +1 katana from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGateII">Baldur's Gate II</a></em>. To very loosely quote the flavor text, traditional enchantments on katanas are next to impossible due to the extremely high basic quality of the swords. Instead, it's implied that fallen warriors may have begged a Wu Jen to infuse their fighting spirits in their weapons with their last breaths, giving the swords a tiny sliver resembling sentience that improves effectiveness in battle. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStorySegregation">This might make the enchanted katanas wielded by about everyone in an army of drow in the expansion pack difficult to explain.</a>) Yoshimo's own sword isn't mentioned to be magical at all, but instead implied to have bonded with Yoshimo to the point where it's superior to a normal katana and refuses to be wielded by anyone else.
</li><li> Xan from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate">the first game</a> has an elven moonblade, who are all empathetic weapons. Because the moonblade has chosen him as its wielder, only Xan can use it.
</li><li> Lilarcor, meanwhile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingWeapon">falls under a completely different trope</a>. Not much 'empathy' to be had on that front.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheElderScrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a></em>
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegendaryWeapon">artifacts</a> of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGodsAreDifferent">Daedric Princes</a> play with it. The artifacts have a tendency to disappear and separate from their wielders if said wielder becomes too dependent on them or otherwise uses them in a way not intended by the patron Daedric Prince. How "empathic" the artifacts actually seem to be varies, and it may be more the will of the Princes simply taking the items back. They are most often handed out by the Princes themselves to faithful servants and tend to show up where important events are unfolding, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">justifying the appearance of the items in high concentrations in certain regions</a>.
</li><li> The sword Umbra crosses over with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">Evil Weapon</a>. It was forged long ago to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YourSoulIsMine">steal the souls</a> of its victims. However, the wielder of the blade becomes a victim as well. Over time, it takes over the mind of the wielder, until they begin to refer to themselves as "Umbra", and turns them into a vicious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>. Either they slay their opponents and steal more souls for the sword, or they are slain, and the sword finds a new and more powerful wielder.
</li><li> From the series' lore, the HoonDing, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Yokudan/Redguard</a> spirit of perseverance over infidels and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddJobGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OddJobGods">Make Way God</a>", will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodInHumanForm">manifest in mortal form</a> whenever the Redguards need to "make way" for their people. In some tellings, the HoonDing does not manifest as a person, but as a weapon. Specifically, a sword.
</li></ul></li><li> Most of the swords and other melee weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> are empathic. In the first game, the Alastor (sword) and Ifrit (gauntlets) actually attempt to kill Dante as a test of worthiness. Meanwhile, in <em>Devil May Cry 3</em>, Dante's weapons (aside from the keepsake Rebellion sword) are all actually the remnant of a defeated boss. Even Rebellion is implied to be this, too, since he can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponAcrossTheShoulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponAcrossTheShoulder">hoist it over his shoulder without cutting himself</a>, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when it <em>does</em> get a taste of its master's blood, it unlocks his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Devil Trigger form</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Special Mention goes to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithFire">Agni</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Ruudra</a> from <em>Devil May Cry 3</em>. While other demons in the game <em>become</em> weapons for Dante in death, these brothers' true forms <em>are</em> weapons; a pair of scimitars with head in their pommels, wielded by two identical headless bodies. Which means after being defeated, <em>they can still talk</em>.
<div class="indent"><strong>Agni and Ruudra</strong>: <em>You shall take us with you! We can be of great help to you!</em> <br/><strong>Dante</strong>: <em>...Okay, but on one condition.</em> <br/><strong>Angi and Ruudra</strong>: <em>What is it? Name it!</em> <br/><strong>Dante</strong>: <em>No. Talking.</em>
</div><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> moments later: when Dante shows off his skills with his new weapons, one of the brothers tells him "Impressive." Cue Dante banging their heads together and reminding them of the condition. When they stay silent, he merely comments "Good."
</li></ul></li><li> The Devil Sword Sparda is the strongest case for this trope, as while the weapon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguousSituation">may or may not carry the soul of the Legendary Dark Knight,</a> it certainly shares his will.

The goats were technically innocent, and upon using it to kill them the sword "abandoned" Jack, requiring him to go on a spiritual quest to retrieve it.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats">Thunder Cats</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Sword of Omens seems to be partly empathic. On many occasions the Sword of Omens reacted on its own, usually by flashing and growing, to Mumm-ra or other evil characters touching or even just approaching it. In one episode the sword was broken after Lion-O was tricked into attacking Tygra with it, and the rest of the episode revolved around the ThunderCats trying to find a way to fix it. Furthermore, the sword has exhibited something of its own personality, such as when Lion-O decided to hunt for sport. The sword reacted by flying from the ThunderCat's hand, embedding itself in the ground, and refusing to be removed until the spirit of Jaga appeared to tell Lion-O that it will not cooperate in an act of evil.
</li><li> At one point Mumm-ra uncovers Excalibur, King Arthur's legendary sword. The swords do battle (eventually abandoning their wielders and duking it out in the air) until Excalibur pierces the Sword of Omen's eye. The ThunderCats suddenly collapsed at the destruction of the Eye, but fortunately Merlin the Magician appeared to restore it before Mumm-Ra could fully triumph.
</li><li> In another instance, Mumm-Ra tricked a Samurai named Hachiman to go after Lion-O, only to discover that both of their respective weapons refused to come out of their scabbards, since neither person was evil.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em> episode "The Forest of Magi-Oar", the Wood Forgers tell the Cats that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantFlyer">Viragor</a> has been terrorizing them and the forest. But when Viragor attacks later in the episode, the Sword of Omens won't work against him. Lion-O later figures out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's because Viragor is the forest's true protector, and the Wood Forgers are really the ones terrorizing him and the forest.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em>: The Omnitrix has a mind of its own — possibly more than one. It will often turn Ben into an alien other than the one he's trying to become, and has a tendency to act in self-defense by zapping bad guys who try to tear it from Ben's wrist. Ben doesn't ask it for help so much as argue with it when it acts up. You could probably even say that the Omnitrix is trying to <em>teach</em> Ben something. His usual plan is to turn into Fourarms and just smack everything around until the problem's solved; forcing him to use other, more complicated aliens like Grey Matter and Cannonbolt is a good way to make him fight more strategically. It also seems to dislike being removed from Ben's wrist. It seems almost happy and enthusiastic when it jumps back on him after being removed in the season two finale, and after being stuck in the bottom of Ben's closet for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">5 years</a>, it refuses to work, and the watchface turns blue <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note123wt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note123wt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note123wt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Forget the Blue Screen of Death; that watch was just <em>feeling blue</em>.</span> When Vilgax later steals it during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10AlienForce">Alien Force</a></em>, the watch refuses to work for him... until <em>Ben</em> presses the dial in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickingTheShapeshifter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickingTheShapeshifter">Tricking the Shapeshifter</a> plan. Even though removing the watch is now possible in the sequel series, Azmuth still seems sulkily resigned to the fact that Ben must be the wielder of his invention.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Centurions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Centurions">Centurions</a></em>, the heroes' Assault Weapon Systems respond to their mental commands.

So if someone was ever, say, despairing and feeling sorry for himself, or high - (stop scoffing, it happened) - the ring wouldn't respond.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReBoot">ReBoot</a></em>: Glitch and the other Guardians' keytools are almost literally a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoAnythingRobot">Do-Anything Robot</a>, able to become any tool or contraption ranging from simple devices to complex machines, and has never been unable to respond to ANY command (barring being incapacitated or damaged). In turn they show sentience, being capable of making decisions based on vague wording or the general needs of its Guardian. This was amusingly demonstrated in one episode when Bob was fighting Megabyte and Bob panics, telling Glitch to turn into 'anything'. It decides to turn into a lamppost, which Megabyte runs into it face-first.
<ul><li> In one episode Glitch was incapacitated by Hexidecimal accessing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> Paint app, literally melting off his arm. Acting on his own Bob managed to gain access to the app and revert all the changes, but still needed Glitch to finish the job. He called for Glitch, now reformed, who immediately flew across the city to aid him.
</li><li> Turbo revealed to Matrix that keytools choose their wielders and would refuse to function for anyone they don't like, and it's later shown that keytools are intelligent and can even communicate directly with their guardian. Glitch was the one to suggest to Bob to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">fuse together</a>.
</li><li> The Daemon arc revealed that the keytools abandoned any Guardians that Daemon had infected. This is why Daemon needed to infect Bob to make portals. Being fused with Bob, it was impossible for Glitch to leave like all the other keytools.
</li></ul></li><li> In the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ExoSquad">Exo Squad</a></em>, Able Squad sacrifices their E-Frame mecha to stop a NeoSapien plan. When Marsh disconnected from his, preparatory to dropping it in a volcano, its onboard computer unexpectedly said, in its emotionless female voice, "Farewell, Operator J.T. Marsh." Another squad member uttered a bromide about "Humans are great creators, but often do not know what they create."
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> was tasked to take a singing sword from a castle guarded by a dragon in the Oscar-winning short "Knighty Knight Bugs"; the sword is a bit on the heavy side for him and has the habit of breaking out into song at inconvenient times. Given that this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a> (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a>), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a>.

</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures">Jackie Chan Adventures</a></em>. Jackie uses a magic walking stick to battle some bad guys. When he gets disarmed, he calls for the stick to return to his hand, only for it to fly into his gut and knock him out. It's played straight when Jade retrieves it and fights with it perfectly. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reincarnation">It was implied that this wasn't the first time that Jade has used that stick.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em>: It has a set of weapons with demons known as Shu-Shus that are bound to them.

Rubilax's eye in the hilt is fairly expressive.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em>: Though appearing only once in the series, the Lotus Blade is implied to be one. In addition to being able to transform into nearly any kind of weapon (and then some) in the hands of those who possess Mystical Monkey Power, it can be summoned by a pure-hearted wielder, and it seemed to have a sense of humor since it ripped off Ron's clothes as it flew by. Since then, it has become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSceneWonder">One-Scene Wonder</a>, and has been a subject that appears in many fanfics, as well as having its abilities fleshed out.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em> episode "Blade of Grass", Finn's newly-obtained grass sword first appears to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">Evil Weapon</a> bent on keeping itself attached to his arm whether he wants it or not, but when he accepts the fact that the sword will always be with him, it does a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and becomes this.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SofiaTheFirst">Sofia the First</a></em>, although not properly a weapon, the Amulet of Avalor possesses a certain degree of self-awareness, enough to know when its bearer is doing something good or bad, in order to deliver a blessing that can be very useful for Sofia or deliver a curse in order to make her understand when she's doing something bad. We then find out why it acted that way—it's holding its original wielder.
