Might even be deliberate, seeing as after the Angels are destroyed, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">civil war swiftly erupts.</span>
<ul><li> Somewhat justified in the fact that over the course of the series, Tokyo-3 and the evas take an ernomous amount of damage, and NERV's infastructure is incredibly expensive just to begin with (Massive rifles for the Evas to use? Experimental particle beam weapons? That crap's not cheap). It's also implied that the economy of the post-2nd impact world is much worse then ours, particularly if doing your laundry and buying steak dinners is "expensive".
<ul><li> Cruel irony. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The real reason NERV exists "is" to bring the End of the World itself on SEELE's terms. The only reason there was Civil War was because of Gendo Ikari attempting to hijack the End of the World himself.</span>

They ultimately succeeded in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescueArc">rescuing the lead</a>, though not without tremendous hinderance and generally having life made a little harder.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, Lelouch and Suzaku want to end Britannia's tyranny. They also happen to be best friends. Unfortunately, Lelouch uses ruthless tactics to get results for the Japanese, while Suzaku believes that Britannia can be reformed with patience. Lelouch's best schemes are too often foiled by Suzaku's ace piloting at the worst possible times, and Suzaku is being used as a pawn by Britannia's corrupt nobility. Eventually, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lelouch is expelled from the Black Knights due to a brutally effective frame-up / exposition combo ploy by Schneizel. Meanwhile, Suzaku realizes he effectively became the very Britannian nobility he spent his whole life opposing and defects to Lelouch. Schneizel believes that two bitter rivals teaming up will still be a fractured allegiance that can be defeated with the combined forces of Britannia's warhead science division and the Black Knights. He's dead wrong.</span>
<ul><li> Also, the Black Knights leaving the JLF to die<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0n49d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0n49d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0n49d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The JLF were generally composed of honor-obsessed suicide soldiers and former Japanese nobility seeking to reclaim their dominion. Lelouch decided the corruption wasn't worth the team-up, especially since they were going to murder a Japanese-sympathetic Britannian princess on her race alone</span>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassNightmareOfNunnally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CodeGeassNightmareOfNunnally">Nightmare of Nunnally</a></em> takes this one step further into Zero <em>and</em> Kyoto flatly selling them out.
</li><li> Britannia made a back-deal with the Chinese Federation's leaders to assimilate them into their empire, but quickly reneged on the deal once it became apparent that the whole country was in a complete anarchic riot. This rational act eventually leads to the total collapse of Britannia, because they unwittingly left one of their key assets in China undefended<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1avlg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1avlg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1avlg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Specifically, the Geass Society that secretly manipulated the entire world with empowered child assassins. If V.V. had survived, the final confrontation between Lelouch and Charles could have gone very differently</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> At least twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Vegeta</a> would deliberately allow the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Universe-Destroying Abomination Of The Week</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">power up</a> so he could have a "worthy" opponent to fight —even going as far as to battle his own allies to let it happen. First, he did it in the Cell Saga, where he stood back while Cell attained his "Perfect" body, then battled Trunks, his own son, when the latter tried to stop it. In a later arc, when he and the other Z fighters raced to avoid the awakening of Majin Buu, he let the magician Babi Di empower him with a malevolent sigil, and forced Goku to battle him instead of helping save the world. Gohan and the Kaio-Shin were left to try to stop Buu on their own. Naturally, they failed, since Buu absorbed the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura">Battle Aura</a> shed by Vegeta and Goku in their duel.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: while Mello and Near start out as enemies (at least, from Mello's perspective), and when Mello visits the SPK headquarters he uses a hostage and is held at gunpoint, but instead gives him a vital- if cryptic- piece of information about Kira.
</li><li> Cosmo Entelechia and Ala Alba are both trying to save the magic world in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>. The problem is that the former doesn't believe in the latter's plan, which has a more optimistic solution. Which is honestly justified considering the situation and who is informing them of it.
</li><li> By volume 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidenRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidenRose">Maiden Rose</a></em>, Eurote and some aristocrats from Taki's country are so determined to get rid of Taki because he's second-in-line to the throne that their in-fighting becomes a great asset to the Western Alliance who they are currently at war with.

Eren has heard that legend before and thinks it's naive because humanity still hasn't banded together. Pixis agrees with him. He tells Eren that humanity does need to stand together soon, or they would all be wiped out eventually by the Titans.

This came to a head when admiral Greenhill and a number of competent officers launched a coup... Only to fail to gain Yang support, as the latter was too loyal to the ideals of democracy to support them, leading to a short and disastrous civil war right when the Galactic Empire was undergoing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">its own civil war</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivideAndConquer">and in fact Reinhardt orchestrated the Alliance Civil War specifically to make sure they wouldn't be a threat or capable of rebuilding after their recent losses</a>). Yang being Yang, he won, restored the democratic but corrupt government... And was the victim of an illegal inquiry <em>because</em> he had saved them in addition to being a war hero, and thus had enough popular support he could have toppled the government by announcing he was doing that. With the Empire fragmented by its own infighting the Alliance could survive, but once Reinhardt stopped the infighting and installed himself as emperor the war ended in short order.

<ul><li> Extremely common in superhero comics, as many writers look for any excuse to have heroes fight each other. As a specific example, the official superteams of countries America is less than friendly with, like Marvel's (former) Soviet Super Soldiers/Supreme Soviets/People's Protectorate/Winter Guard and DC's Great Ten (China's national super team) are always - ALWAYS - more interested in keeping American hero teams out of their home countries than they are in teaming up to stop the rampaging monster/villain/aliens/whatever that the American heroes have chased across their border.

When the four ask if there's any chance at all the two groups can cooperate, they're told that the two groups have been rivals for a long time, and it would take more than the defense of the minor, extrauniversal C'hou to bring them together.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInitiateBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInitiateBrother">The Initiate Brother</a></em>, Emperor Akantsu won't send forces to help against the barbarians, believing that Lord Shonto is disloyal and is exaggerating the threat as an excuse to build up an army. Inverted and subverted, though, since Shonto ends up pursuing Divided We Stand: he <em>encourages</em> these fears of rebellion, figuring that if he can't convince the Emperor to raise an army against the barbarians, he can still convince the Emperor to raise an army against <em>him</em>, and it's better the army is prepared for the wrong reason than not prepared at all. Shonto then agrees to surrender his "rebel" army so that the Emperor can meet the barbarians with a joint force - although in fact, the Emperor screws it up.

</li><li> The battle of Chibi, where Wu's navy and the nascent Shu army have to work together to defeat the enormous Wei navy—this lesson sticks and they succeed in driving off Cao Cao's forces.
</li><li> The battle for southern Jing had several Wei-allied local commanders who just couldn't manage to work together, and each lost their garrisons in turn to Shu forces.
</li><li> Hefei is notable for Li Dian, Yue Jin, and Zhang Liao not getting along at first and at risk of being wiped out in their garrison. However, Zhang Liao convinced Li Dian and Yue Jin to put aside any personal inemnity for the duration of the battle, and they were wise enough to listen to him, resulting in a surprise Wei victory.
</li><li> Meng Da's rebellion fell apart because its conspirators were too interested in saving themselves when cornered rather than supporting each other, leading to Wei forces taking the rebellion apart with ease.

</li><li> Taya Valkyrie has never treated Ivelisse Velez well, but her behavior never had a negative impact on her team, Perros Del Mal, because Velez was too brief and minor a member to matter.

A relevant Imperial propaganda piece states that 'There is no innocence, only shades of guilt.' <em>Everyone</em> is held in the darkest suspicion of heretical thought, <em>entire worlds</em> are lost while organizations bicker over their jurisdiction. The only person above reproach is named the Immortal God Emperor of Mankind and he might be <em>dead</em>.
<ul><li> The Imperium has at least half a dozen Thoughts For The Day dedicated to this, among them "Divided we stand, united we fall". Considering the extreme hierarchical nature of the Imperium, a few higher-ups going rogue could (and has) lead to massive problems - some regiments probably only recognized their superiors turning to the side of Chaos a few weeks <em>after</em> being told to paint those cool spiky stars over their old insignia.
<ul><li> The Imperium at present is extremely decentralized for a reason, though, because of laws enacted after the events of the Thorian Reformation, no one power group can have control over more than one function (administration, technology, etc.) of the Imperium, and there are <em>several</em> extremely powerful watchdog organizations in place to make sure no-one oversteps their mandated authority and to control abuses of power. And burn heretics, of course.
</li><li> This state of affairs came about as a direct result of the Age of Apostasy, where due to some complex political maneuvering one man, Goge Vandire, became head of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">the Administratum</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SinisterMinister">the Ecclesiarchy</a>, and the Imperial Assassins at the same time, and (as a result of controlling the entire supply chain and being able to excommunicate anyone he wanted) also became de facto leader of <em>both</em> the Imperial Guard and the Imperial Navy. He promptly set himself up as Emperor-in-all-but-name, established a rule that became notable in Imperial history for its tyranny, despotism, and body count <em>even by Warhammer standards</em>, acquired a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade">harem/bodyguard</a> of elite female fanatics, and had a personal fleet of warrior-priests who went around purging everyone who might be a threat. Only the Space Marines and (parts of) the Adeptus Mechanicus remained outside of his command, mostly because they withdrew into their own fiefdoms. Needless to say, nobody with knowledge of the Age of Apostasy is eager to let it happen again, hence the decentralized command structure.
</li><li> Said organisations <em>are also hanging separately</em> within their own ranks. The Inquisition spends hours in philosophical debate with a bolter in one hand and a power sword in the other. There's even two different factions within the Inquisition arguing over whether or not it's a good idea to <em>euthanize the Emperor</em> to see if he'll reincarnate. Oh dear.
</li><li> You have this problem within organizations within the Imperium, with many sub-factions constantly fighting each other, sometime literally. One common justification for Imperium players to fight each other on the tabletop is that both companies got the same order to get some holy item and bring it to their superiors, and they're fighting to the death to just make sure the other guy <em>doesn't do it first</em>. On a grander scale, you would think the Tau, Eldar, and Imperium would work together more often against the Cyborg skeletons, raving green brutes, galaxy eating bugs, and the literal legions of Hell, but you'd be dead wrong.
</li></ul></li><li> Thankfully, this also works against the Imperium's enemies as well. Ork Waaaaghs only last for as long as a single Ork Warlord can successfully exert his authority; if he dies or gets discredited in some way, the battered defenders now face a dozen smaller Ork armies fighting each other as well.
</li><li> Chaos works like this: Khornates turn on each other if no other enemy presents itself, Slaaneshi think of defeat as yet another sensation, Nurglites will spread disease to everyone, and Tzeentchians will backstab you at the most inopportune time to carry out some massively convoluted plan (and that's not even getting into the established rivalries between servants of opposing gods). Each and every of Chaos' Black Crusades have all failed for this reason.
</li><li> Even the Eldar will occasionally fight each other, usually because two Farseers had differing visions of the future and how to bring about the best possible outcome. One White Dwarf battle report had Ulthwé fighting to stop Alaitoc from massacring a human colony based on how they saw the resulting domino effect playing out. This is <em>really</em> bad because even without killing <em>each other</em>, they're sliding to extinction due to low birth rates and almost every other race in the universe wanting to kill them too.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>, oh so very much. Solars, Lunars, Sidereals and Dragon-Blooded are all trying to protect Creation in their own way; it's just that the Dragon-Blooded's way involves demonizing all the others to keep their orderly society going, the Sidereals' way involves manipulating said society from behind the scenes because they don't trust any of the others with power, and the Lunars' way involves tearing down said society because of its increasing corruption and instability. The end result is Creation's heroes spending a whole lot of effort fighting each other when they could be fighting the Abyssals, Deathlords, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairFolk">Fair Folk</a>, and other forces who want to <strong>destroy the world</strong>.

Let's see, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack">Task Force VALKYRIE</a> wants to deal with the supernatural in secret, while Network Zero wants to blow open the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">Masquerade</a> through new media. The Long Night are premillenialist Christians aimed at "redeeming" monsters who view the Malleus Maleficarum, the Catholic Church's black bag group, as followers of "the Great Whore of Babylon." The Philadelphia sample setting takes it a few degrees further, with the general mood of "Not In My Backyard" and an emphasis on how the hunters are more devoted to territorial pissing than, you know, monster hunting.

Partially due to propaganda made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Kane</a>, the United Nations temporarily cut military funding to the GDI.

Once Nod was fully committed, he returned with funding not only restored but increased.</span>
<ul><li> A little distraction like, lets say... a fullscale alien invasion is not a reason for Nod and GDI to quit fighting each other. This caused some irritation by the aliens, calling humans "warlike to the extreme".

<ul><li> Shepard can level this accusation at the Illusive Man in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em>, calling him out on his descent from quasi-heroic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidWhatIHadToDo">Doing What He Had To Do</a> to out-and-out attacking the Alliance at a critical time. Despite his efforts to brush aside Shepard's allegations, it's clear he doesn't really care, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> mostly because he's indoctrinated</span>. Conversations with Javik and the AI Vendetta suggest this is pretty common where Reapers are concerned; they had a similar faction in their own politics which prevented them from deploying the Crucible.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> and all its expansions, are is built by this trope.
<ul><li> In the vanilla game, the Alliance and Horde are in a cold war, but that does not stop either side from having adventurers(i.e. players) screw with the other side. When C'thun shows up and kicks off the Old Gods plan to kill the planet, it is only because they worked together did they stop Crisis #1. Once that's dealt with however, it's right back to screwing the other which starts Crises #2 through #4.
</li><li> <em>Burning Crusade</em> brought Crisis #2 which opened the Dark Portal to Outland and an invasion from the Burning Legion. The Alliance and Horde team up and push them back and, once they get through the gate, the first thing they do is screw the other side over. Because they are so busy screwing each other, they do not deal with Illidan Stormrage, and tha t threat falls to the Sha'tar and adventurers to deal with. When Kael'thas goes all Burning Legion, the Sha'tar form the Shattered Sun Offensive which was comprised of both Alliance and Horde and they successfully averted Crisis #2.
</li><li> In <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em> Crisis #3 takes center stage. At this point, <em>WoW</em> takes this trope and goes ham: the the Alliance and Horde weren't fighting each other at first, they just thumbed their nose while they actually dealt with the Lich King. Then rebel Forsaken kill both the Alliance and Horde troops at the Wrath Gate, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">then the Alliance invaded Undercity in an attempt to take back Lordaeron while the Horde was in disarray, then King Varian Wrynn and Garrosh Hellscream got into a fight and open war was declared, while they were already fighting a war against the Scourge</a>. This led to the Broken Front, where the Alliance was beating Scourge forces, only to be attacked from behind by the Horde, who were in turn slaughtered by the Scourge giving the undead two battlefields worth of troops in one victory. Meanwhile, the Argent Crusade, realizing that the Lich King would not fall to a world divided, decided to host a friendly jousting tournament designed to get the Alliance and Horde to work together when the time came to assault Icecrown Citadel, but this ended up being all for nothing because the two factions ended up fighting each other <em>again</em> in a gunship battle over Icecrown. The Lich King would have won the final battle if it were not for the intervention of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tirion Fordring and Terenas Menethil's ghost.</span> And it should be pointed out that while the paladins and death knights of their respective organizations don't get along perfectly well due to their contrasting motivations and methods for their fight against the Lich King, they are able to work together.
</li><li> <em>Cataclysm</em> shows up Crisis #4 &amp; spends a large portion of time on the very costly and devestating war Garrosh Hellscream is waging against the Alliance, and not the giant pissed off dragon that wants to end the world. Various lesser factions end up pulling most people's heads out of their asses and avert the end of the world.
</li><li> In <em>Mists of Pandaria</em>, the Horde under Garrosh's leadership is falling apart because everyone started to notice how big of a prat he was. Garrosh's warmongering, disregard for all life that isn't an orc, and his love of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Kick the Dog</a> tactics have caused the Horde to fall apart, while the Alliance solidify their unity and take advantage of the fracturing Horde which will eventually lead to a two sided invasion of Orgrimmar to end Hellscream's rule.
</li><li> Following their formation in <em>Cataclysm</em>, the dwarves' Council of Three Hammers was beset by mutual distrust on the part of the Bronzebeard and Wildhammer representatives towards Moira Thaurissan of the Dark Iron Dwarves. This paralyzes them in <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> when the Zandalari trolls get the local trolls to rise up against the dwarves. Neither Muradin Bronzebeard nor Falstad Wildhammer will send troops out of fear Moira will take advantage of their absence. In response, Moira sends <em>her</em> troops out to fight and aid Varian Wrynn. Shamed at how their distrust nearly doomed them, Wildhammer and Bronzebeard swear to not let such feelings get in the way of what has to be done again. As a result, in <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, the Dark Irons are an active participant in the Alliance's campaign into Draenor.
</li><li> <em>Legion</em> starts a whole new crisis in the form of a fresh invasion by the Burning Legion. At the beginning, the Alliance and the Horde <em>were</em> working together, launching a joint attack on the Broken Shore. Things go sour when the Horde is forced to retreat and, to the Alliance, it looks like they're being abandoned. This, as well as the fact that the battle cost both sides their top leaders, leaves them disinclined to work together in the Broken Isles and even has Gilneas's Genn Greymane actively gunning for Sylvanas Windrunner.
</li><li> There's some of this in the Order Hall campaigns unique to each class. Some of the campaigns consist of avoiding this trope by bringing together disparate factions of the same class under one banner regardless of being Alliance, Horde, or other. For example, the multiple paladin orders joining the Order of the Silver Hand. The Shaman campaign consists of trying to unite the four elemental lords together under one cause, the problem there being most of them are concerned only for their own realms and the Firelands and Skywall both being in the midst of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a> that the Earthen Ring shamans must resolve before securing their aid. The death knights of the Ebon Blade actively attack the paladins' Order Hall <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">out of a desire to resurrect Tirion Fordring into their ranks, despite the rift and outrage this would cause</span>.
</li><li> The backstory of <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> has Sylvannas intending to cause this in the Alliance with the War of Thorns. She believed that occupying Darnassus would force an immediate response from Anduin to free the hostages. However this would anger the Gilnean refugees, who have spent years waiting for the Alliance to retake their homeland from the Forsaken. The resulting friction would have weakened the Alliance and given the Horde the upper hand, were it not for Genn becoming more level-headed and Sylvannas deciding to simply <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">burn Teldrassil and Darnassus with it</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTierkreis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenTierkreis">Suikoden Tierkreis</a></em>, this plagues the Magedom of Janam. The Mage Forces are led by Danash VIII's <em>first</em> wife, Shairah; their Arcane Acadamy is headed by his <em>second</em> wife, Rizwan. Then there's the Blades of Night's Veil, commanded by Chrodechild, who Danash <em>wants</em> to take for his <em>fourth</em> wife — yes, there's a third, who complicates things even more <em>without</em> her own command... Needless to say, they have problems <em>without</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">The Order of the One True Way</a> breathing down their necks.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Arcueid</a> seems to have little issue with cooperating with the Church when necessary. They, on the other hand, feel differently as she's technically a vampire as well. Fortunately, she's essentially indestructible so they decided 'Fuck it' and agreed to work with her on occasion. That's mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">background material</a> due to our only seeing sane Church members, but Ciel and Arcueid also have a funny tendency to start fighting to the death when differences arise. And they're <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">friends</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em> takes this trope and runs with it. At the end of the first (non unique) chapter, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loghain ditches the battlefield and lets the king die - along with all but two or three Grey Wardens.</span> The Wardens themselves are then persecuted from one side of Ferelden to another, even as the darkspawn steadily devour the countryside.
<ul><li> Worse, a civil war starts when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loghain basically shoves his own daughter and the queen off the throne as her "regent" and more than a few of the nobility take offense to this, as the King of the Ferelden must have the support of the Bannorn and Loghain isn't even in line for the throne</span>. It also helps (?) that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loghain</span> doesn't believe that a Blight is occurring and thinks the Wardens (who <em>know</em> that a Blight is happening) are enemy agents from a country that occupied Ferelden and ruined his childhood. Since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Loghain</span> is a war hero that freed Ferelden from said country a lot of his supporters follow him even as he grows increasingly paranoid and commits greater atrocities to protect his nation.
</li></ul></li><li> Used to great length in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> with multiple factions warring against one another. The templars and the mages fight constantly, even though they should be working together to help everyone in Kirkwall. Members of the Chantry oppress the qunari, who in turn try to overtake Kirkwall in disgust. This even occurs with members of player character Hawke's party. If Hawke picks a side in the final act and the party members on the opposing side don't have their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues">friend or rivalry meter high enough</a>, they'll leave the party. In some cases, they may even try to kill Hawke.

He hates Team Rocket beacause <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Giovanni was his father and after Team Rocket was defeated by Red, Giovanni left him and he blames Team Rocket</span>.

</li><li> Yet another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> example is in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em> series, which contains <em>five</em> different campaigns (so far) in which everyone would much rather kill everyone else than work together to defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsualAdversaries">Orks</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar">Necrons</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">Tyranids</a>, and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLegionsOfHell">Chaos</a> that are rampaging everywhere. This ranges from <em>Winter Assault</em>, in which the Imperial Guard and Eldar briefly ally before arbitrarily betraying each other, to <em>Soulstorm</em>, in which three different divisions <em>of the same faction</em> are pounding at each other.
<ul><li> It gets lampshaded repeatedly in the sequel, especially the <em>Retribution</em> expansion, as you can hardly go two plot-centered missions without someone calling out their same-side enemies on how there's such a bigger issue at stake. The Space Marines deal with the obfuscating Senator, they end up fighting themselves when Chaotic corruption begins to infiltrate their ranks, they have quite a few bitter issues with the Guard, the Eldar want to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">wipe out the entire planet</a> rather than fight WITH the Imperium against the Tyranids, etc. Ironically enough, only the Inquisitor (the one usually most hell-bent on driving wedges between factions) seems willing to use cross-faction Alliances, even enlisting the Orks as mercenaries during their campaign.

</li><li> This is the plot of the third Spec Ops mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelAvengersAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelAvengersAlliance">Marvel: Avengers Alliance</a></em>. Five of the X-Men got possessed by the Phoenix Force and wanted to use it to save mutantkind. The Avengers, on the other hand, were of the opinion that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsNotAToy">Phoenix Force Is Not a Toy</a>, and that it would end up wiping out the entire planet, mutants and all. And while they were at each others' throats, the bad guys were trying to turn the situation to their advantage. This even turned into a gameplay mechanic; you had to choose whether to side with the X-Men or the Avengers each time you started a mission, and you weren't allowed to use core members from the opposite side during fights or deploys.

</li><li> Firefall: Despite the fact that literally over 99% of the planet is covered in Melding (alien corruption used by the Chosen alien race) and humanity's populace has dwindled from ten billion to less than a million, you still kill about 4-12 humans per mission. On average. Between the Somalian Pirate look-alikes, the Black Hills gang, the Reaper Assassin's Guild, the Biker Buzzards (though, about a third of these guys are nice people), the android-loving Ophamin, and even some fucked up corrupt Accord Generals, the Accord and Ares have more than they can take. Even ARES teams will duke it out against each other and fill mass graves, especially over valuable resources like mineral-rich mining sites and high-value treasure maps. Luckily for humanity, the Chosen tribes have their own tribal wars in pursuit of total dominance over the rest of the Melding lands, so the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Enemy Civil War</a> prevents total victory for the Chosen.

<ul><li> After taking over their own province of Alinor, seceding and annexing the provinces Valenwood and Elsweyr to create The Aldmeri Dominion, the Thalmor manipulated the centuries of racial strife between the Argonians of Black Marsh and the Dunmer of Morrowind to provoke the former into warring with the latter while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown">they're still reeling from</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">a much bigger crisis</a>, causing the Empire to withdraw from both provinces and leading to Morrowind and Argonia's independence.
</li><li> When they finally attacked the empire openly, their invasion was driven back by the combined might of the Imperial Legion, Skyrim's Nord militias, and Hammerfell's Redguard warriors defeating them on separate fronts. Yet because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">the war had been so costly for the Empire</a>, the Dominion were able to force a "peace treaty", known as the White Gold Concordat, that was heavily skewed to their interests, in particular agreeing that the Empire would relinquish territory in southern Hammerfell that the Redguards were still holding. Rather than accept this and yield to the Dominion, the Redguards chose to secede from the Empire and the Concordat, and continue to hold off the elven invaders themselves. Though the Dominion was eventually driven out of Hammerfell as well, it's thought by many that that forcing this issue and fracturing the Empire further was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">what the Thalmor had wanted all along</a>.
</li><li> Finally, another key concession in the Concordat was renouncing the man-turned-deity Talos from the Empire's pantheon. As the Nords of Skyrim deeply revere Talos, and already hold mutual animosity and suspicion towards elves, seeing the Empire renounce their venerated hero for the sake of elven interests is taken by many Nords as a sign of cowardice and surrendering, turning a good portion of the once-totally loyal province sour towards the Imperials. The Thalmor at this time had also <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">captured a skilled Nordic aristocrat-turned-soldier, one who would naturally become a strong leader and champion for the Nordic people, and subtly manipulated him into developing an anti-Imperial secessionist agenda of his own</span>, planting the seeds for the Skyrim <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a> within the main game, the outcome of which could potentially fatally shatter what's left of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire">the Empire</a> and leave both sides weakened for an inevitable second invasion.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Scion kills off half the world's population and many of the most powerful heroes sent to stop him</span>, various groups decide to fight amongst themselves believing it's hopeless to resist.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deviant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Deviant">Deviant</a></em>, various conflicts are made ten times more difficult because of the frequent heroic in-fighting. The fact that they don't share many similar goals and have clashing personalities only makes matters worse.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em>, This is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Salem</a> is relying on, as she sends her followers into the different Kingdoms to divide them against each other, to ensure that they can never unite against her, which is what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Ozpin</a> is trying to accomplish.
<ul><li> Volume 7 ends this way. After defeating Tyrian and Watts, the heroes discover that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cinder</span> has infiltrated Atlas Academy, most likely to hunt down the Winter Maiden, and that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Salem</a> is on her way to Atlas with an army of Grimm in tow. The next course of action? Ironwood decides to turn on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Rubys group</span> for keeping vital information from him and going against his orders, and has the Ace-Ops (sans Clover) take down <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Team RWBY, as well as sending all other personel after Jaune, Nora, Ren, Qrow, and Oscar.</span> When the latter attempts to confront the General and try to restore peace, Ironwood responds by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shooting Oscar, a boy in his early teens, off a cliff.

<ul><li> On a smaller scale, The Ace Ops continuously bicker with each other without Clovers leadership, which is what allows the much more united <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Team RWBY</span> to defeat them in battle in the 12th Episode of Volume 7.

<ul><li> The American military in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited">Justice League Unlimited</a></em> spends so much time making superweapons to defend against/destroy the Justice League, they completely ignore the fact that relying on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a> as opposed to the people who are busy saving the world every day might actually be a bad idea.

</div><ul><li> On a larger scale, this has played out in the war as a whole. The Fire Nation launched an overwhelming first strike against the Air Nomads, managing to commit genocide without any other nation coming to their defense (at least successfully). The Water Tribes and Earth Kingdom then decided to see to their own defenses, with the Southern Water Tribe only coming to the Earth Kingdom's aid 97 years into the war.
<ul><li> The Southern Water Tribe had been enduring constant raids by the Fire Nation for sixty years before the beginning of the show, so they had their own problems to worry about. The Northern Tribe, though? No excuse.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder14');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder14" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A classical parable concerning this is about the sons of king Attalus of Pergamon (although similar motifs seem to reoccur about a lot of different people) and his large number of sons. As they were squabbling over who would succeed him, he took a bundle of spears and asked his sons that whoever could break them could succeed him. No one could. The king then took each spear in turn and broke it easily, making a point about unity being strength.
<ul><li> Variations of this parable have since been recounted far, <em>far</em> too many times to count, in both history and fiction. When it's not representing the fascist movement, it's illustrating the key to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedCliff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedCliff">defeating Cao Cao</a>, or teaching <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeNinjas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThreeNinjas">three young brothers</a> about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePowerOfFriendship">The Power of Friendship</a>. It has nonetheless avoided becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a>.
</li><li> The metaphor for this "strength through unity" approach is visually symbolized by a bundle of sticks often including an axe and is called a fasces. It is commonly found in art and heraldry all over the world. Its use has lessened somewhat after Mussolini adopted it as his symbol and named his ideology after it, but unlike <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSwastikas">another symbol we could mention</a>, it is still fairly easy to find outside of Italy, particularly in the United States (where the old national fondness for Roman imagery and the institution of federalism make the fasces an apt symbol) and France (they're on the semi-official arms of the Fifth Republic).
</li></ul></li><li> A warning against this was attributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> at the signing of the Declaration of Independence: "We must all hang together, or assuredly we will all hang separately."
</li><li> Extremely prevalent trope in the military: every organization has some degree of political infighting and factionalism. Patton himself said that 'Competence in the battlefield is a myth. The side who screws up the least wins.'
<ul><li> Many, many other examples can be found <a class="urllink" href="http://www.strategypage.com/humor/articles/military_jokes_20047130.asp">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This was the reason the republicans lost in the Spanish Civil War. While the fascists were all united and had a well-defined leadership and chain of command, the republicans had many factions. The Trotskyists allied themselves with the Anarchists because they thought the Revolution needed to come along the War (on grounds that not doing so would be the reason they would lose, just as the German revolutionaries had). The Stalinists thought that they needed to win the war first and then implement the Revolution. However, despite their ideological differences, the Stalinists openly persecuted the Trotskyists and the fact that their factions split further between Stalinists, Trotskyists, Anarchists and democrats meant the fall of the Republic and the rise of Franco's regime.
</li><li> This is also the reason why the Nazis arose in the first place. Quoting the International Socialist Review: <em>Again and again [Trotsky] called for a united working class action against the Nazi movement. The reformist SPD the largest working-class based party in Germany feared mobilizing its ranks against Hitler, preferring parliamentary manuevers and appeals to the state instead. Trotsky argued that the the Communist Party (KPD)which alone still did not have the forces to defeat Hitler should propose a United Front with the Social Democrats (SPD) for the purposes of physically confronting the Nazis. Such a policy would have been gladly supported by rank-and-file workers of all political shades, would have exposed the Social Democrats' half-heartedness and would have stopped Hitler in his tracks. Sadly, the KPD followed a completely opposite strategy. Under the directives of Stalin, the KPD leaders refused to call for a United Front with the SPD, whom they insanely considered to be the moderate wing of fascism [social-fascism]. This policy paralyzed the working-class movement and allowed Hitler to take power without a fight.</em> This disastrous strategy is what led the union leaders, party directives and congressmen of both the SPD and KPD to the concentration camps.
</li><li> Another example, although this time it applies to the bad guys: towards the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, prominent Nazis were tearing each other apart to succeed Hitler, despite the advancing Allied armies. This continued until the literal last days of the war.
</li><li> The Byzantine Empire indulged in this all too frequently. Internal political squabbling at the Battle of Manzikert <em>whilst on the battlefield with the enemy</em> was a major cause of the Byzantine defeat there. Their army was almost destroyed, and the Empire never fully recovered. A century or so later, after Constantinople was conquered by the Venetians and their allies during the Fourth Crusade, the three Byzantine kingdoms that formed from the remnants of the Empire spent more time fighting each other over the Imperial title than trying to take their city back. All the squabbling between Christian Balkan states pre-Turkish conquest partially fits this trope.
</li><li> A perfect example was the Serbian Empire, a powerful state in Middle Ages Balkans, with a modern Code of Law...But after the death of a strong Emperor, it was conquered by Turks, because its Lords couldn't unite and were fighting about who would be new Emperor. It resulted in 5 centuries of bondage under the Turks(well actually the Turks only controlled Southern parts of today's Serbia, the Northern and Central parts were under the Turks only for 219 years)
</li><li> An absolutely <em>perfect</em> example is the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Arausio">Battle of Arausio<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> circa 107 BC. Two Roman armies were raised to stop the advance of the Three Germanic Hordes (Teutones, Cimbri, Marcomannii), one led by a Patrician, and one by a Plebian. The Patrician, Quintus Servilius Caepio, absolutely HATED his counterpart, to such a degree that he refused to go along with his plans to merge the two armies as one and wait for the German attack. Caepio kept his army separated due north of the other army, and when the Germans came, they swarmed over his army and utterly crushed it, then waited a short time before swarming over the other army next. Nearly 100,000 Roman soldiers and camp followers were killed, nearly twice as many as the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae">Battle of Cannae<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Even when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SecondSinoJapaneseWar">Second Sino-Japanese War</a> had broken out in 1937, Yan Xishan (warlord of Shanxi province and owner of the Taiyuan arsenal, China's only manufacturer of artillery) was <em>still</em> more worried about avoiding being brought into the orbit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> than he was of actual military defeat by the Japanese. While he was right to suspect that Chiang wanted Taiyuan arsenal for his own troops, Chiang's real concern was preserving the railway connection to the border with Soviet Mongolia as this was the most efficient route by which Soviet aid could be delivered to his troops <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2s1jx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2s1jx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2s1jx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalist Party was the sole recipient of Soviet military and economic aid to China during the war, much to the chagrin of other organisations like the Chinese Communist Party. The Soviet aeropolanes were flown and the tanks driven in, but the machine-tools and artillery and aviation fuel etcetc all had to be transported by truck. A longer route meant that the Soviet truck-convoys would have to carry more fuel for themselves and therefore less other stuff </span>. Then again, Yan's ability to retain control over his personal fiefdom despite its nominal occupation and even to <em>bribe the occupying force of 15,000 Japanese troops into staying on in China under his command for four years after the Japanese surrender</em> (through the literal and liberal application of gold, hookers, and heroin) shows that perhaps he had nothing to worry about from occupation after all.
<ul><li> To a much lesser extent, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ChiangKaiShek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> and the petty Warlords of Shandong and Guizhou provinces. They suspected that Chiang only thought them useful as passive meat shields. They were right, if only because their military capabilities were that non-existent. When they gave up Shandong without a fight, those foolish enough to flee to the Nationalists were summarily shot for treason - to unanimous public approval.
</li><li> And in the Japanese-occupied areas, many partisan groups failed to co-ordinate their activities and resources or even actively ratted each other out. As a result it was almost laughably easy for a more centralised and less cruel faction (the Communist Party, then run from Yan'an in Shaanxi province) to eventually take over in those areas furthest from the front lines (and Nationalist support and control).
</li></ul></li><li> It has been suggested that this is the problem with global warming. No country is willing to decrease its own emissions when other nations are still increasing theirs. This is especially true with developed vs developing countries. Developed countries consider it unfair that they are forced to cut their emissions when developing countries are still increasing theirs. For their part developing countries decry it as unfair that they are being forced to solve a problem that they did not create, even if they are currently contributing to it just like everyone else.
</li><li> The Roman Empire had this all the time. In many cases senators would spend most of their time arguing with each other, and would try to scapegoat or assassinate anyone they deem a threat to their post. It also faced many cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis">Succession Crisis</a>, with more than a dozen men claiming the title Emperor in less than fifty years. Then the empire was split in half into the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, which ended with the Western Empire finally falling after a long period of decline. The Eastern portion (called either the Roman or Byzantine Empire depending on where you lived), survived and even thrived until it too wasted away until it was nothing more then a impotent, little city-state.
</li><li> The American Motors Corporation was a conglomerate designed to compete with the seemingly unstoppable Big Three (Ford, GM, Chrysler) companies in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>. The leader of the merger envisioned it becoming the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">world's largest company</a>, encompassing many of America's independent marques (Nash, Hudson, Studebaker, Packard, etc). However, he died in 1954 before a deal could be formed with Packard or Studebaker, leaving just Nash and Hudson to merge into AMC. Packard and Studebaker were dead within a decade, and AMC saw the writing on the wall following <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a> Oil Crisis and was sold out in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEighties">The '80s</a> to Renault, then Chrysler.
</li><li> British Leyland, a conglomerate of independent British automobile marques, was (as described by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em>) plagued by sectarianism with employees not wanting to work with their former competitors, which when combined with poor management and nonexistent quality control, led them to make some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAllegedCar">shockingly awful vehicles</a>.
</li><li> The Incan civil war, between brothers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">Atahualpa</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid">Huáscar</a>, between 1529 and 1532, is this trope to the core. Not only was it an intern war, but the various tribes that formed part of the empire actively purged each other over previous conquests or fightings. In the end, Atahualpa won, and over 1 million people had been killed. And then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">the conquistadors</a> arrived. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShaggyDogStory">The rest is history</a>.
</li><li> One of many reasons the American-Indians were crushed is that they did not perceive themselves as all being "American-Indians". They perceived themselves as being from separate tribes. An Apache, for example, would have considered a Cherokee only slightly less foreign than a white colonist. By the time all tribes realized just how big the English-Americans' ambitions were, they were too weakened (from both inter-tribal wars <em>and</em> conflict with the whites) to form an effective alliance.
<ul><li> Similar logic explains the Plantation-era phenomenon of "African" warlords selling African slaves they conquered to the British. Back then, racial identity was more tied to country/state/tribe than a shared skin color. People simply did not think on a national scale.
</li></ul></li><li> Many people believe that this is why the United Kingdom will ultimately leave the European Union on World Trade Organization rules (known less formally as a "No Deal Brexit"). Even ignoring Jeremy Corbyn's whipping Labour to vote against the withdrawal agreement (which could be expected due to tribal party politics), Remain-supporting MP's in the British parliament are refusing to vote for the deal on the table because they think they might be able to force a second referendum on Brexit. Meanwhile, many Brexiters in the Conservative party also chose to vote it down, in the hopes of forcing Theresa May into making more concessions in order to win them over. All the while, if the negotiating time runs out and no withdrawal agreement has been ratified, then the UK exits by default without a deal in place - something many experts agree would be a disaster.
<ul><li> Worse, disintegration of the United Kingdom as a result of Brexit remains a very real possibility. Polling strongly suggests that the Scots (who voted overwhelmingly to Remain in the 2016 referendum) would vote for independence in order to remain with the EU if May's successor were to successfully force a no deal Brexit through Parliament. In addition, Northern Ireland may decide to hold a referendum on unification, if only to avoid a return to a "hard" (policed) border between Norther Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
</li></ul></li><li> This is commonly considered a weakness of the Democratic Party compared to the Republican Party in United States politics: the Democrats are a big tent party with a lot of wings that are both distinct and distrustful of each other. A leader of the Democratic party needs to be able to operate with the Blue Dog, Progessive, and other wings to push policies along and minimize defections. The party, however, is generally able to get things passed and stand in unison when it needs to. The party is even able to <em>weaponize</em> their fractious nature at times: at many times candidates are able to run not just against Republicans, but against their own leadership in Washington, and the leadership (usually Pelosi as this is most common in House races) even encourages it.
