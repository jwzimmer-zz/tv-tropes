My father likes to gamble on baseball, and my mother is busy developing an illegal ROM for cheating on slot machines. My father tells me, 'When I win big, I'll take you to Hawaii.' Then my mother says, 'Your father is not allowed to leave the country, so that will never happen. Ha ha ha.' Our house is always filled with laughter."</em>

Parents are viewed as having a responsibility to ensure their child's happiness and welfare, as a necessary component to their healthy development into responsible and mature adults prepared to face the demands of society.
</p><p>Parents in many comedic series believe that this is a load of poppycock, but this isn't usually due to malice or disdain for their offspring. They are simply such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a>, either through self-absorption or stupidity, that they don't even <em>understand</em> that passing all their debts onto their children, arranging random and contradictory marriages, and engaging in thoughtless abuse and neglect of their children could cause psychological harm. They aren't applying the rod to avoid spoiling the child — they don't even know it's there. (Rod or child, whichever.)
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Needless to say, these sorts of parents tend to be the sort that would never be allowed to keep their children. At the very least neglectful parents would have to go through a few parenting sessions. But just as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">There Are No Therapists</a> in fiction, there are also apparently no social services, either. The helpless kid is just going to have to grin and bear it — and because it's usually played for comedy rather than drama, they usually do. Sometimes they can escape to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayingWithFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayingWithFriends">Staying with Friends</a>.
</p><p>The tropes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeleagueredBureaucrat">Beleaguered Bureaucrat</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">Department of Child Disservices</a>, and Social Services Does Not Exist overlap since they all involve the same problems. Social Services employees are often overworked, underpaid, lack resources, and suffer the publics wrath.
</p><p>There's a simple reason for this with the consistently abusive parents — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">the abuse is a big part of the series or movie,</a> and if Social Services did step in and take the kids away, they'd probably never let them go back.

<ul><li> The parents of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em>, who are known as the worst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> parents in the world. Due to the father's laziness and the mother's gambling habits, Hayate has been the primary breadwinner in his house since the age of eight. In the very first chapter they steal sixteen-year-old Hayate's hard-earned paycheck, lose it all on pachinko, then sell their only son's organs to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">"some very nice people"</a> to pay off their 156,804,000 yen ($1,467,504) debt. And just to top it off, this happens on <em>Christmas Eve</em>. The mental scars left by his parents persist for a very, very long time. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">And this doesn't even include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">what happened with Athena</a>.</span>
<ul><li> Hell, Hayate's so used to his parents being complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a> that he usually speaks rather casually about all the abuse he's been put through. Usually to the discomfort and disbelief of his listeners. The example speech at the top of this page was a cheerfully-read <em>grade school</em> oral report which left the teacher and the entire class in tears.
</li><li> The reason why they're so hard on Hayate and stole his paycheck? Hayate has an older brother, who escaped their influence. They learned from their "mistakes" and made sure to report Hayate being underage themselves both to steal his paycheck and to destroy whatever credibility he may have had with the authorities.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>:
<ul><li> Genma Saotome, Ranma's father. He's a selfish and casually abusive father whose antics are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariouslyAbusiveChildhood">played for humor</a> despite having essentially ruined his son's life at every possible opportunity. That Ranma hasn't cracked and murdered his dad by now, or at least beaten some sense into him, makes him a possible candidate for sainthood. Of course, Ranma being a martial artist, he's <em>tried</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">beating sense into Genma's thick head</a>, but it never seems to take. What's worse is that Genma is usually portrayed as a <em>stronger</em> martial artist than Ranma, and "for training" still engages in behavior that would be felonious child abuse anywhere else, like grabbing his food, and then eating it when he complains and fails to take it back in a short amount of time, laying the karmic debt for the collateral damage he causes on Ranma's head, and there's the infamous ending <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> where he blackmails Ranma into marrying Akane by holding hostage the cure to Ranma's curse, which exists purely because Genma dragged Ranma to a Chinese training ground, and completely ignored the tour guide who said the training ground was too dangerous to use.</span>
</li><li> Ranma's mother starts out well. When she notices that Genma is trying to steal their toddler son away in the middle of the night, she screams, yells, and does whatever it takes to protect her son, including hitting Genma over the head with any and every little thing she can reach. Genma eventually convinces her this is a "necessary evil" for the boy's well being so that he can become a "man among men" and a productive member of society. It's perfectly okay for him to swear to commit seppuku if he fails, but expecting a 5-year-old Ranma to fully comprehend that his life is at stake as well, and having him sign the contract is beyond the pale, even in the most feudal of Japanese homes. What's worse, is that when she finds out about Ranma's curse, she comes at him with a sword, that she does not know how to wield, endangering not just himself or herself, but everybody nearby, and the police do nothing.
</li><li> Soun Tendo, while not nearly as much of a bastard as Genma, does almost <em>nothing</em> for his family other than occasionally bursting into tears, leaving his eldest daughter to run things. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">However; at the time the series takes place, Kasumi probably could legally have her younger siblings in her care as she's a legal adult</a>... but how does she make any money? Although to be fair, Soun Tendo does have some kind of income to provide for the family, but it's not stable.
</li><li> Principal Kuno would regularly shave off his son's hair on a whim (and in hair-trimmer vs. bokken duels) and generally humiliate him. The anime expands this by hinting at physical abuse (flashbacks from the episode where Kuno and the Principal's relationship is revealed include Kuno Senior taking Tatewaki's food while apparently berating him, forcing his head into a sink so he can shave him bald, and tying him up and dangling him from a tree). Already a fan of Hawaiian culture, he also abandoned his family to live in Hawaii for several years. He came back even worse. What makes it even more jarring, is that the abuse is not just limited to the Kuno family, but the entire high-school, staff included, is subjected to his antics, and not a single parent or member of law-enforcement intervenes.
</li></ul></li><li> Ryuunosuke and her father in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/UruseiYatsura">Urusei Yatsura</a></em>, often considered the prototype for Ranma, although Ryuunosuke is an actual girl who was raised as a guy by a dad who refuses to recognize that she's a girl, mainly because he doesn't think a girl can take over his precious tea shop. This has left her with rather bad gender issues; she's fully aware she's a girl and wants to be a "real" girl more than anything, but her father refuses to allow her to wear female clothes or even talk of herself as being a girl, nevermind try and get a boyfriend or try to act like a girl... in fact, because she's spent so long being brought up to act like a boy, she doesn't even know how to act like a girl. She also has an arranged marriage she doesn't want. Namely because her fiance Nagisa Shiowatara's father is just as much a loony as her own — upon having a son, rather than raise him as a boy, he deliberately raises him as a girl in order to match the "boy" that Ryuunosuke was raised to be. Unlike her, however, he does seem to know how to act like a guy, and he does realize that he's actually male, but he enjoys crossdressing. What makes things worse for her is that he possesses a number of ghostly powers, due to having died from eating sea urchin ice cream then coming back from the dead... though this also gives him some ghostly weaknesses, like being repelled by spirit wards. He's also, despite his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishonen">Bishōnen</a> body, an expert sumo wrestler and quite capable of beating her in a fight.
</li><li> Gendo Ikari, as usual for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, is an example of a normally comedic trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructed</a> into something tragic. At least he palms his kid off on someone who <em>tries</em>... eventually. Of course, given that this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalyptic</a> Japan, it's possible that social services actually <em>doesn't</em> exist; and regardless, given that NERV basically <em>is</em> the world government, even if they do exist there's nothing they could do to stop Gendo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>:
<ul><li> In a typical comedic use of this trope, Isshin Kurosaki regularly launches surprise assaults against his son Ichigo, claiming it as a form of martial arts training. Ichigo only remarks on this as an unpleasant distraction. Isshin's far more likely to be on the receiving end of physical abuse from Karin, but he did at one point rip off his shirt and tell his daughters to "Come give your big, sexy daddy a hug!"
</li><li> Orihime's older brother Sora <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">took over raising her</a> as soon as he turned 18, due to their parents' abuse and neglect. Apparently no one thought it necessary to remove Orihime OR Sora from an abusive environment before then, and after Sora's death Orihime lived alone, despite being <em>in middle school</em>. There is a vague <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> her legal guardian is now a non-cohabiting aunt who provides some financial assistance. We don't have much detail on Chad's family situation except that he, too, seems to have had no living family and no guardian since at least middle school, and yet receives no attention from social workers. Even Uryuu lives in his own apartment rather than share a house with his estranged father, although we know Ryuuken keeps an eye on his son from a distance and presumably is still his legal guardian.
</li><li> All of the Rukongai is a decidedly non-comedic instance of this trope. The society operates at a feudal social and technological level, so there are no institutions or services available for newly arrived souls to help them adjust, not even for the souls of children. Lucky kids land in a relatively peaceful and affluent district and are cared for by lonely adults (like Momo and Toushirou and their adoptive "grandmother"). The unfortunate are dumped in violent, impoverished areas and have to scrounge for food and form gangs for self-defense (like Gin and Rangiku). Hisana and Rukia's story is basically a cautionary tale in what the lack of social services will lead people to do out of desperation... like abandon your infant sister rather than starve.
</li><li> Zaraki Kenpachi was the worst case by far. He didn't have anyone growing up and became a vicious feral <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> just to survive. Fortunately for him, and unfortunately for his foes, he was incredibly strong even as a youth. Yachiru Kusajishi barely avoided this fate after being adopted... by Zaraki. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, this connection is eventually justified when it turns out she was his zanpakuto spirit all along.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a></em>: Kaoru's grandfather was apparently in the habit of beating the hell out of him with his cane while goons held him down and burning his <em>deceased mother's</em> last worldly possessions, just to show his tyrannical disapproval of her marriage to Kaoru's father. Kaoru should be nominated for sainthood for just running away without first snapping and murdering his grandpa, like any <em>normal</em> person would have done when pushed that far.
</li><li> Somewhat subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BakiTheGrappler">Baki the Grappler</a></em>. Baki's the son of a mentally and physically abusive martial artist who's never around and a rather cold and distant mother. His father only had Baki conceived because he wanted someone strong to fight, and repeatedly tries to beat him to death when he fails to live up to his expectations. So why doesn't anyone try to help? Because his father's the strongest fighter in the world, to the point where the standard procedure of the US military is to <em>get out of his way</em>. Nobody dares to do anything because they don't want to earn his wrath.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BinbouShimaiMonogatari">Binbou Shimai Monogatari</a></em> is about 15-year-old Kyou, who takes care of her 9-year-old sister Asu without any help. She manages, even with the little money she is allowed to earn, but it's still a highly unlikely situation in modern-day Japan.

His 'training to be a strong man', even if it was mostly played for laughs when referenced, was pretty horrific. Getting tossed down a cliff, put into a jungle in the middle of the night, tied to a balloon and allowed to float away, and Lord knows what else is strongly implied to have traumatized Luffy; he avoids thinking about what happened, and his grandpa is the only person he truly fears.

Emperor Charles is nothing but horrible to Lelouch and Nunnally (And in all odds, a few of the other princes and princesses of Britannia that we never got to see.).

The loss of his only decent parent left its scars on both children, literally in Nunnally's case, and it's no coincidence that Lelouch practically reveres his mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until he actually gets to meet her again eight years after the murder and realizes she wasn't Parent of the Year either</span>.
<ul><li> Of course, considering he's, you know, <em>the emperor</em> and everything, even if there are child services in Britannia, they're not going to say a word to him.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Loveless">Loveless</a></em> avoids the common partner trope to this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">There Are No Therapists</a>, by having Ritsuka go see one regularly to help with his personality change. However, it is very evident to nearly every adult that sees him in the first volume that he is being both physically and mentally abused by his mother and no one does anything about it! While his homeroom teacher attempts to help him out by trying to meet his parents, she is discouraged from doing so by Soubi and her faculty, and she generally has little to no success. This could be an example of Japanese social mores at work here, priding the notion of a person caring for themselves and outside help is unwelcome, making this a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, but still...

His training methods included <em>slamming him against a boiling hot steamer if he kept tofu boiling for longer than a minute</em>. He also would beat the ever-loving hell out of him with his cane, to the point where Jan's back is covered with scars (which at one point clues his rival in to the nature of his upbringing). It's also heavily implied than Jan never went to school, just lived with his grandfather learning how to cook.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em>:
<ul><li> It appears that, with VERY few exceptions, the titular character was all but socially isolated to the point of emotional abuse from very early childhood. And since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Not So Different</a> moment with Gaara, fanfiction writers take it to the logical extreme, horrendous physical abuse is added on to the emotional abuse, making one wonder how Naruto managed to be as well-adjusted as he is if that's true.
</li><li> There are a lot of orphans on the show, mostly because of the wars and rampaging demons that were around. A lot of them get adopted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Villains">Villains</a> or turn into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a>.

(and to a lesser extent, Sasuke)
</li></ul></li><li> Likewise, social services might as well be non-existent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>. The Sohma family is large and powerful and probably capable of bribing the authorities to ignore all the kids they've traumatized, the number of which could start their own national baseball league. But this doesn't help explain Tohru, whose mother was so incapacitated after the death of her father as to have forgotten to feed her 4-year-old daughter for weeks on end, or Uotani, whose emotionally distant and constantly drunk father fails to realize his daughter has joined a gang by the fifth grade. These guys give the NGE parents a run for the gold in the "emotional scaring" event in the Destructive Parenting Olympics. One reviewer noted: "in the world of Fruits Basket, good parents are as common as penguins in the Saharaevery single one is either neglectful, smothering, unfeeling, abusive, misguided, or dead."

Not to mention the family then all but poisoning national water supplies in order to induce superpower development and taking the very few young teenage girls who manage to survive back to their facility, brainwashing them, and ultimately forcibly impregnating them.

This is all made slightly worse by the fact that Conan is in contact with both a lawyer and several dozen police officers regularly. There's also no mention that his parents, who initially had "gone to America and gotten in an accident", never came back to collect him and in fact have been doggedly coming up with random excuses for leaving him with the Mouris for the last 67 volumes.
</li><li> Shinichi Kudo's situation before he was de-aged, in which he (a teenager) had been living alone in a giant house for an unspecified amount of time because his parents had decided to take an extended vacation.

It's made worse when Brock leaves his dozen siblings with their newly found father, who is completely incompetent (come on, who would expect this guy to take care of 9 children?). And it's later revealed that their mother <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> was alive all along and wandering around the world like her husband.</span> It seems that leaving your children completely alone with just an older teenage brother in charge isn't considered a crime in the Pokémon world.
</li><li> Maron's parents from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamikazeKaitouJeanne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KamikazeKaitouJeanne">Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne</a></em> emotionally scarred their daughter by regularly leaving her at home alone at night as a young girl because of their jobs. Before she was even <em>in grade school</em>, they left to work overseas, and haven't contacted her since when the series begins. Miyako and her family might have been right across the hall to take care of her, but really, who the hell thought it was okay for a girl that young to be living in an apartment alone? By the time the series begins, Maron is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> incapable of comprehending "love" because "no one taught [her] about it" and spends most of her time pretending not to be depressed and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaitou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaitou">stealing valuable pieces of art</a> in the name of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">God</a>. It gets worse when you start thinking about how Miyako's father, who knows all about Maron's situation and sees her on almost a daily basis, is <em>a police officer...</em>
</li><li> If not for this trope, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kanamemo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kanamemo">Kanamemo</a></em> would've been a pretty darned short series/manga.

When she does find somewhere to live, one of her housemates is a <em>child molester</em>.

<ul><li> Seto Kaiba was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">abused by his adoptive father</a>, then, after the man's death, took over the guardianship of his younger brother despite being only sixteen.

</li><li> In the manga, Bakura is seen writing a letter to his sister asking how she and their parents are doing, implying, naturally, that he doesn't live with them. Sure, his father <em>is</em> still alive and presumably sends him money and set up the apartment, but he's underage and living completely alone. Mostly to stop the Spirit of the Ring from putting other people in comas, of course, which just makes it worse.
</li><li> Raphael, Alister, and Valon probably would've escaped Dartz's organization <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> even though he was the one that started each of their breakdowns</span> if they'd had more support or someone to properly look after them. In both the dub and original Japanese, Raphael and Alister combine this with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTherapists">There Are No Therapists</a> due to their misanthropy.
</li><li> Jonouchi, at least in the manga, should've never been kept with his alcoholic, gambling-addicted, and potentially abusive father. He seems sane and optimistic enough, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">one has to wonder</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserSonOfLoserDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoserSonOfLoserDad">about his theme of gambling and chance cards....</a>
</li><li> Somewhat justified with the Ishtars, (who, especially Marik, also clearly need some therapy), since they lived underground and cut off from society almost entirely and had other goals once they freed themselves.
</li><li> When you really think about it, it's kind of the same issue as Pokemon. Kids go on long trips to play card games, cutting school, and constantly getting themselves into deadly situations. Who cares? Apparently not their parents.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh!

They're in <em>middle school</em>. While Kyoko's case is plausible, Homura and Mami live in their own apartments. Homura apparently registered herself in school after a lengthy hospital stay. In fact, the only notable family is the titular character's. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Not that they can help their daughter much anyway.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GraveOfTheFireflies">Grave of the Fireflies</a></em>, Seita and his younger sister Setsuko are left homeless after the destruction of their home by Allied bombing and the death of their mother. Their aunt takes them in for a short while, but after leaving her house neither the police nor doctors are willing to help them and they must fend for themselves, stealing food to survive and living in an abandoned bomb shelter by a river.
</li><li> <em>Kodomo no Jikan</em> is full of situations where Social Services should have intervened. Reiji had a terrible childhood thanks to his abusive father and neglectful mother. He was then taken in by his older cousin Aki, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who he fell in love with and had a relationship with before she died of cancer</span>. Now he's the sole guardian of his younger cousin Rin, who he's trying to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WifeHusbandry">raise to take her dead mother's place</a>.</span> Then there's Rin herself, who has a huge crush on a man twice her age that manifests in truly disturbing ways, not the least of which includes a level of sexual knowledge no child that young should possess.

She may be slightly more well-adjusted now, but nobody seems to raise eyebrows on a teenage girl literally living alone. To be fair, however, Haruka's mother did attempt to see several doctors to discover what was wrong, but none of them could offer any help. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She also did realize the evil of disowning her but by then the damage was done.</span>

First, there's the main character who is treated as literally <em>non-existent</em> by his entire family, and its subordinate families because he wasn't born with a high enough "magic power" rank, and then hunted down as a "runaway" because he <em>was driven out by his treatment</em> until his paternal great-grandfather took him in and gave him food, shelter, and some honest-to-goodness actual affection, <em>and his father absolutely refuses to even attempt to acknowledge how that is cruel.</em> Come volume 6, there's Yui Tatara <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who is specifically trained to become a psychotic assassin starting at the age of three by her own family keeping her life in a constant state of peril, up to and including shooting at her in her sleep, and this is noted to be a "family tradition" going back at least three generations.</span> You'd think with the very strict gun and blade laws in Japan, someone would have noticed....
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Isuca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Isuca">Isuca</a></em> has all the main characters go through this. Shinchiro is all but abandoned at the family apartment, when both his stage magician parents go globe-trotting "for training" over an extended period of time. What's worse is that in the process, they also force him, a full-time high school student, to go get a job as well because they cut off his funds while leaving him responsible for the daily and monthly expenses involved in living at that apartment. Isuca's parents "go missing" seven years prior to the start of the story, (making them legally dead), and she has to live in a mansion, alone, taking on the dangerous job of "demon slaying," again, alone, because the rest of the family, save for her maternal grandmother, wants her dead or gone. Her cousin, Suseri, is forced to undergo a training regiment that would be considered felonious child abuse just about anywhere else because of her mother's inferiority complex towards Isuca's mother, up to the point that (in the manga, at least) she would put her own daughter's life in peril, without hesitation, for even the slightest chance to steal away Isuca's chances to take the title of Clan Head so that Suseri will become a Puppet King. Granted, Social Services probably aren't equipped to deal with the supernatural, but all the mundane stuff that these characters go through should raise some eyebrows.

At least his sister Mary ended up in an orphanage. After Billy became Captain Marvel, he managed to get around the subject by simply transforming into the Captain, putting on a fancy suit, and pretending to be his own uncle. It doesn't hurt that in his Captain Marvel form, Billy resembles his dad, so it's easy to pass off.

<ul><li> Something must be seriously wrong with Gotham's Social Services system considering how many of the rogues were abused. Riddler beaten for cheating? Two-Face on a fixed, drunken coin toss? Black Mask neglected by his socialite family? Scarecrow's grandmother used to lock him in an old church after putting something on his clothes to make birds attack him. Presumably he would have either missed school entirely afterwards or come to school with at least a few visible wounds. Surely that was an extreme enough case to get the ball rolling with social services even back in the day. But no... You just had to let him grow up to be a sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommyIssues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommyIssues">Mommy Issues</a>, didn't you, social services?
</li><li> This is lampshaded by Catwoman in the graphic novel <em>Selina's Big Score</em>. Selina, a straight example of this trope herself, had pulled off a multimillion-dollar heist, and gave a good portion of the money to her recently-deceased friend's mother and young daughter, knowing full well Gotham's social services are a joke.
</li><li> Batman himself is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandfatherClause">one of the few superheroes</a> to still consistently use kid sidekicks; however, with the increasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> tone of the comics, it hasn't escaped many fans that letting preteens and teenagers (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">non-superpowered ones</a>) go around fighting mobsters and supervillains must break several child safety laws. It's unlikely Child Services could even catch Batman though. A few characters have taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">shots at Batman</a> for his use of Robins but the issue is rarely treated too seriously.

Also subverted later, after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Pride were all killed off. No sooner had the kids escaped, than Captain America found them and put them all in separate foster homes. The kids all promptly escaped and regrouped, because they missed each other and found social services ill-equipped to help them get over the trauma of having one's super-villain parents being killed by Biblical giants.</span>

<ul><li> Quite common in many fanfics. Scootaloo is a filly whose parents have never been seen, so the fanfics are legion about her horrible or nonexistent family. It's always up to the Mane Six to rescue her, and one of them (usually Rainbow Dash) provides a home. Though they're almost always allowed to in the end, you can bet Rainbow Dash (or whoever) will worry about social services deeming her home proper; is the library good enough, can Scoots learn to fly well enough for a cloud house to be okay, etc? They're usually not so unreasonable in the end, but you've gotta wonder about the status of it if <em>one of the heroes who has saved the world multiple times and a personal friend of Celestia</em> has more to worry about than villains who use a child as a punching bag when it comes to being allowed to keep a child.
</li><li> Sometimes, Scootaloo will be in an orphanage, but it's usually not an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphanageOfFear">Orphanage of Fear</a> — just not as good as having a family, which again, one or more of the Mane Six will provide in the end.

It's not even labeled as a "girl scout cookie cartel" or anything similar.
</li><li> Averted in the most traumatizing way in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em>—the contrast of wacky alien hijinks with the reality of a teenage orphan trying and failing to support her baby sister is a main plot point.

At no point do the authorities see anything wrong with this, or make any attempt to remove him despite him being a) a child, b) an alien, and c) not a criminal (at least initially). The only extent he's given any kind of realistic treatment is when he's allowed to go to a proper school — although given the premise, it might have been arranged by his "family" as well.

They're just homeless kids who live in the streets without any supervision, causing mischief. Granted, in <em>Dead End</em> one of their members does have a mother (but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>) that he frequently ditches so he can hang out with the gang. Another member mentions having a father who's drunk all the time. They were often used in gangster movies to symbolize the kinds of kids gangsters were before they grew up and became criminals.
</li><li> From the adaptations of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">Carrie</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie1976" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie1976">Carrie (1976)</a></em>: Even by the looser standards of 1976, there's no way that any social worker would let Carrie stay with a mother as abusive as Margaret. Might be justified in that Margaret, at least in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Carrie">the original book</a>, views the entire government (including, presumably, social services) as godless and Satanic, and would most likely react violently to any attempt to take away her daughter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Reality Ensues</a> in the 1999 sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRageCarrie2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRageCarrie2">The Rage: Carrie 2</a></em>, which opens with Rachel's mother (a fanatical Christian with a mindset very similar to Margaret) not only losing custody of her daughter but being flat-out institutionalized, the state having judged her unfit to control even her own life, let alone her daughter's. That said, her foster parents aren't much better; while they're more neglectful than abusive, they're raising her purely to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">get paid by the state</a> for participating in the foster system.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Carrie2013">2013 remake</a> notes that the state intervened to force Margaret to stop <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeschooledKids" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomeschooledKids">homeschooling</a> Carrie. It's woefully inadequate, but at least they made an effort.
</li></ul></li><li> In a way, this is the whole premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneBabyGone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GoneBabyGone">Gone Baby Gone</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Amanda's mother is neglectful to a point that is just shy of manslaughter, but rather than alert the proper authorities the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> takes matters into his own hands, abducting the young girl, staging her death, and secreting her away to live in safety.</span> The author of the book the film is based on, Dennis Lehane, used to work with abused children.
</li><li> Kevin's parents by the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HomeAlone">Home Alone</a></em> film have problems with this. Leaving him behind once can possibly be justified (particularly since the film clearly shows they mistook the annoying neighbor kid for Kevin,) but not keeping track of a child two years in a row simply because they were afraid to miss a plane? No one in the family notices a child missing for the duration of a flight from Chicago to Miami (and a child who's been missing before, no less?) And once they report it to the police, they JOKE about it (out of nerves, but still?) In real life, this magnitude of neglect would certainly prompt at least an interview with social services.
</li><li> In Stanely Kubrick's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShining">The Shining</a></em> the pediatrician apparently doesn't think it might be a good idea to call social services for a kid who talks to imaginary people, has an abusive alcoholic father who is an emotional timebomb just waiting to go off, and has a mother who makes flimsy excuses for her husband's behavior. Especially after the kid was injured during one of the father's drunken rages and his talking to imaginary people started after that incident. And there's the fact the kid blacked out from the thought of spending the next few months stranded in an isolated hotel with his abusive father.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em>, the Ministry of Magic doesn't appear to have any department specifically designated to the welfare of children — at most, an official investigating a <em>different</em> infraction might notice additional bad things going on in a home and try to do something themselves. The only time the Ministry looks into the life of "the Boy Who Lived" is when the Improper Use of Magic office threatens to expel him for using magic on Privet Drive. (And ironically, the one case where Harry did actually use magic 1. himself and 2. unjustifiably, he was let off scot-free.) This is in keeping with the depiction of government bureaucracies as rife with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">misfeasance</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">malfeasance</a>, and nonfeasance. JK Rowling has a rather low opinion of social services and the British government born from personal experience.
<ul><li> When Harry was growing up at the Dursleys, he was frequently bullied, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment">Denied Food as Punishment</a>, and locked away in a cupboard under the stairs for days at a time. Apparently none of the neighbors on Privet Drive or anyone from Harry's school thought anything of it. There is also a fan theory that Dumbledore was involved in <em>preventing</em> social services from being called, as being taken from his aunt's custody would end the protection from his mother's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASeriesOfUnfortunateEvents">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a></em>, the Baudelaires go through a series of guardians who are either abusive or incompetent and eventually end up wandering around on their own <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as wanted criminals</span>. If there is any equivalent of social services in their world, it's too corrupt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless">stupid</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">uncaring</a> to do much. This, however, is entirely fitting given the way adults are portrayed as universally incompetent or evil (or dead).
</li><li> The Bucket family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a></em> is dirt-poor to begin with. After Mr Bucket loses his job, things get worse, but no one seems to notice the four starving grandparents confined to a single bed or that Charlie is looking a lot thinner and doesn't have the energy to go outside at recess.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoaldDahl">Roald Dahl</a> stories like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesAndTheGiantPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesAndTheGiantPeach">James and the Giant Peach</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Matilda">Matilda</a></em>. As you can see from this, he likes this trope.
</li><li> While nearly every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VCAndrews" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VCAndrews">V. C. Andrews</a> novel revels in this trope (except for the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Orphans">Orphans</a></em> series, but just barely), <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Heaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Heaven">Heaven</a></em> is probably one of the worst cases. Heaven's father is an alcoholic who only comes home to screw his wife. When he comes home for good, he sells his children to childless couples for money. It doesn't help that Heaven tried to reach out to her teacher for help, but her teacher turns out to be incredibly useless, only taking Heaven and her brother out for an expensive lunch. You would think she would show more concern since she <em>knew</em> Heaven and her siblings were on the verge of poverty and couldn't go to school every day because they had to work on the farm.
<ul><li> In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfThereBeThorns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfThereBeThorns">If There Be Thorns</a></em>, Cathy is aware that social services will investigate the family if she and Chris adopt Cindy (the daughter of one of Cathy's ballet students, who is terminally ill), and thus likely discover that she and Chris are brother and sister, not husband and wife. So she makes a private arrangement with the girl's mother to decree that she wants Cathy and Chris to be Cindy's guardians. But even this would warrant an investigation.
</li></ul></li><li> In keeping with the time period they were set/written in, the orphan protagonists of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HoratioAlgerJr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HoratioAlgerJr">Horatio Alger, Jr.</a>'s books tend to be left to their own devices to get ahead in the world. Charities exist, but are overstretched and can do no more than provide minimal food and shelter in bad weather for the children.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoxcarChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoxcarChildren">The Boxcar Children</a></em> was written in the 1920s. Social services as we know it really didn't exist, with the exception of orphanages that focused on caring for the children they had, not tracking down runaways. The children <em>are</em> figured out and united with their grandfather in a matter of a few months, though.
</li><li> There is a series of children's books by Barbara Robinson called "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBestChristmasPageantEver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBestChristmasPageantEver">The Best _____ Ever</a>". The stories revolve around a family of children called the Herdmans. Their mother has been stated to be continuously working long shifts and is only sometimes seen outside of work and their dad <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">caught a train years ago and has never been seen since</a>. They have virtually no adult supervision and criminally, repeatedly beating each other up, setting things on fire, stealing, smoking cigars, have no apparent source of income, and live in a house that's a death-trap with a cat that's incredibly dangerous. CPS actually <em>does</em> have someone assigned to them, but she got caught in a pit trap by the kids and nearly scalped by the cat, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWillBellTheCat">now she's as afraid of the Herdmans as everyone else</a>. She drives by once or twice a month and assumes that if they haven't burned the house down or died, they're probably okay.
<ul><li> In <em>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever</em>, the Herdmans don't know the story of Christmas and have it explained to them by the Sunday School teacher. Gladys's reaction to hearing that Mary was dismissed to a <em>barn</em> to give birth, had to wrap Baby Jesus in rags instead of clothes, and a trough instead of a bassinet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Irony">is to demand to know where Social Services was</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiamondBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DiamondBrothers">Diamond Brothers</a> mystery series, when Nick Diamond's parents move to Australia, he stays behind and moves in with his big brother Tim instead. Tim works as a private detective, but he's so incompetent that they barely have enough money for food, clothing, or roof repairs. Actually, incompetent doesn't cover it; Tim appears at times to be borderline mentally retarded, and though he's a legal adult is clearly unfit to be the sole caretaker of a minor. Their parents are totally oblivious to the situation; they occasionally send cheery postcards from Australia, but rarely send money and never visit.

</li><li> Lampshaded, a bit, in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a> 's "The Body." When Chris misses too many days, the truant officer shows up. If Chris has been beaten bloody, the officer goes on his way. If he's just skipping classes, the officer takes him back to school. The Narrator notes that no one questioned it at the time.
</li><li> Sadly true in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TamoraPierce">Tamora Pierce</a>'s works, being set in Medieval analogues. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BekaCooper">Beka Cooper</a></em>, when three siblings lose both parents (one to jail, the other mysteriously disappearing), they're out on the street begging in less than a week, and only saved when their father is found. Even in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Circleverse">Circleverse</a></em>, which is in many ways more similar to modern day, Briar was forced to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StreetUrchin">Street Rat</a> due to a similar situation.

Amp's parents <em>might</em> have made arrangements for him, but Kyle and Kirbie were literally abandoned nearby by their parents, and Lone Star, as soon as he finds them, promises to look after them, and that ends the matter. All the more so in that another character observes that being a kid superhero is being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldier</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">At the end, the Cloak children too young to have developed powers are taken in charge by some kind of social services, but the erstwhile Betas, none of whom are fourteen yet, are just allowed to move into the Cloak stronghold, with one Ranger also staying there.</span>

<ul><li> Pretty much any parent on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em> falls into this trope, even the well-meaning Michael. It can range from simply not listening or paying attention to their children, to openly ranking their children from favorite to least favorite, to adopting a Korean child to make their children jealous, to adopting a child to screw their rivals, to setting their kids up to take the fall for various felonies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em>: Okay, so it's many years ago and it might have been necessary but you would have thought that some nice person in a state somewhere would have been worried about the two young Winchester boys moving around everywhere and acting too old for their ages. Especially as their father is often drunk/neglectful/absent. And <em>especially</em> as their mother died when they both were very young. Although the frequent moves and constant use of fake IDs probably helped keep Child Services from ever catching up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren">Married... with Children</a></em> Based on the descriptions that the Bundy children give of their childhoods, it's a miracle that Peggy wasn't arrested for neglect. Not that Al does much either, but at least he has the excuse of being at the shoe store all day...
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></em>, where social services do exist, but the system is far from perfect and it suffers from many limitations such as dwindling budget, lack of manpower, and outdated/incorrect data. Many times the detectives stumble across a case that social services really should have picked up on, but the victims unfortunately fall through the cracks in the system.
</li><li> Mentioned early on in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">the original series</a> as well. Logan chews out a social worker for not following up on a months-old report of child abuse, and she replies by showing him her computer to give him an idea of how big their "active file" really is. To Logan's credit, he does apologize, and there turns out to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">a very good reason</a> why he's taking this case so personally.
</li><li> Sam's mom on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly">iCarly</a></em> should've had Sam taken away from her on general principle after one of her many dangerous or neglectful episodes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FallingSkies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FallingSkies">Falling Skies</a></em>, obviously the larger system has broken down, but once they take the mind-controlling harnesses off the kids backs there doesn't seem to be much effort to interview them about their experiences nor offer them counseling for what was obviously a very difficult experience. One is pretty much left to wander around the compound freely with a dazed expression.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified">Justified</a></em>, Noble's Holler serves as a refuge for battered women in the absence of any regional domestic violence centers. In turn, when it comes out that Loretta's father is dead, Child Services does come in right away and put her in a foster home.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS">Shameless (US)</a></em> social services do exist but they seem to have largely given up on the Gallagher family. The parents consist of an absentee mother and an alcoholic father, and the kids have been taken away by child services in the past. However, it never seemed to stick and now Fiona makes sure that they stay under Child Services' radar.
<ul><li> In season 3, Child Services catches the Gallaghers on an especially chaotic night (Jimmy's father is illegally performing an operation on a gunshot victim in their kitchen) and the children are taken away. However, Fiona is able to clear the matter up and the social worker quickly concludes that the kids would be better off living at home with Fiona than being put into the foster system (Lip, Ian, and Debbie are too old for the "good" foster placements). The judge also quickly recognizes that Frank is an extremely neglectful parent and everyone would be better off with Fiona assuming legal guardianship of the kids.
</li><li> In season 4, Child Services returns to follow up with the family because of what happened to Liam. Fiona's in prison (she violated her probation) and Frank is in the hospital, leaving Lip to take care of everything. The social worker comes for a surprise visit and sees that the house is in chaos with the Native American kids, Liam, Carl, Carl's new friend and her siblings, and Chuckie running amok. Lip tries to explain and covers for Frank and Fiona's whereabouts. The social worker realizes that the mess was caused by the Gallaghers trying to help some homeless kids and is so impressed that she gives Lip another chance. She even tells him the exact day and time that she'll return for her next "surprise" visit.
</li></ul></li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>, when Harmon Rabb seeks to be the guardian to Matilda "Mattie" Grace in season 9: because social services are very thorough.
</li><li> Beacon Hills on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TeenWolf">Teen Wolf</a></em>. Isaac's parents are dead, he is still a minor and attending high school, but it is unstated who his legal guardian is, and he alternates between living with Derek or Scott. Boyd disappears for several months, only to return to school and nobody seems to investigate what happened. Erica likewise disappears and does not return at all. Also a possible case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleParents">Invisible Parents</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalObliviousness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalObliviousness">Parental Obliviousness</a>.
</li><li> A borderline example might be the Barone family in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyLovesRaymond">Everybody Loves Raymond</a></em>, who leave their adult sons full of complexes and neuroses after a hit-and-miss upbringing. Marie and Frank combine <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">My Beloved Smother</a> with an emotionally illiterate father and play favorites to such an extent that you wonder if Social Services might at least have placed Robert and Ray on an at-risk register...
<div class="indent">SUCK IT UP!
</div><ul><li> An aversion is at least alluded to in one episode, wherein Debra and Ray (through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills">poor communication</a>) both leave the house on separate errands and leave their twin sons alone; when they realize, they rush home to find the daughter has returned home from a friend's house and is taking care of the boys. Marie notes that if not for the daughter, Debra "would be facing jail time."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em>:
<ul><li> There were a couple of cases (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS3E5TheBonding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS3E5TheBonding">"The Bonding"</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E11HeroWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS5E11HeroWorship">"Hero Worship"</a>) in which young children were orphaned and it was weirdly unclear what was going to happen to them. When some incongruous member of the senior staff (Worf in the first case, Data in the second!) wasn't hanging out with them, these bereaved, traumatized, and parentless children seemed to be left completely to their own devices.
<ul><li> In both of those cases, Worf and Data being close to the kids was at least consulted with Counselor Troi, and Troi approved those requests. With Worf, it was because he was a fellow orphan and the child's mother died under his command, so Worf felt a degree of responsibility to help the child. With Data, it's because the child was deeply traumatized by seeing his parents and everyone he knew die around him and was emulating Data as a defense mechanism (the fact that Data is the one who rescued him from the wreckage of the ship where his parents died certainly was part of it as well), which Troi encouraged on at least a short-term basis to help him deal with the trauma. Troi would almost certainly be the most appropriate member of the senior staff, and any childcare on board would probably ultimately report to her and she'd be the one to approve at least any temporary living arrangements onboard before the child could be returned to the civilian world would make sense.
</li></ul></li><li> Toyed with in another case (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS4E4SuddenlyHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekTheNextGenerationS4E4SuddenlyHuman">"Suddenly Human"</a>) where a Human boy orphaned in an alien attack and then adopted by said aliens is slated to be returned to his Human family, especially after evidence of possible abuse by the adoptive father surfaces. Ultimately the evidence is ruled circumstantial and the boy is returned, as per his own wishes, to his alien family.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims2">The Sims 2</a></em>, they shaped up somewhat, but they became a little over-responsive.

<ul><li> The teen example is justified; teens can cook, clean, hold down a job, drive, and care for younger sims; the social workers don't <em>need</em> to intervene since they can take care of themselves and any kids in the household. The same is true for child sims in Sims 1.

</li><li> Mindy's mother in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> leaves her toddler in a harness attached to a tree and expects her dog, Buttons, to watch over her time and time again; she's otherwise unsupervised. Naturally, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadlyBatteredBabysitter">Buttons</a> is the primary reason Mindy remains <em>alive</em>. Lampshaded when Mindy's mother leaves Mindy alone to go to a "better parenting conference".
</li><li> Let's go over the Delightful Children's situation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em>. They were kidnapped and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">brainwashed</a> by a man who then <em>adopted</em> them and is implied to frequently subject them to abuse. How in the world did five children disappearing go virtually unnoticed, and why has nobody caught on that there's something off about how the kids behave?
</li><li> Just how the hell did Mr. and Mrs. Turner in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em> leave their son in the hands of a sadistically evil babysitter and be oblivious to the fact that she's, well, evil? And they still neglect him when home.
<ul><li> Granted, Timmy's misery is the reason that he gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOmnipotent">fairy godparents</a>, but it's not like his parents know that. And what about the other kids Vicky babysits or often meets? And her poor little sister...
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>, Peter and Lois don't start out so bad. But they degenerate into complete jerkasses, with Peter even stating he doesn't care for the kids that much. And Meg is treated absolutely appallingly in many episodes. In "Dial Meg For Murder" Peter lassos her, drags her down the stairs, and prepares to brand her with a <em>red hot poker.</em> Turns out she's already been branded by the mayor, not that Peter cares. He also practices riding a bronco on Chris' back. Lois is more one for emotional neglect, only showing the slightest affection for her kids when it suits her. Even Stewie doesn't get off scot-free, often left on his own for long periods of time, or with no company other than the family dog. The dog is intelligent and can talk, but still. When Meg is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">Calling the Old Man Out</a>, she states that if anyone from the outside world knew how he treated her, Peter would be in jail by now.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GoofTroop">Goof Troop</a></em>, Pete gets away with such things as tricking his preteen child into taking over his job for a day, pressuring him into skydiving, threatening him in front of a public official, and admitting (or all but admitting) to being a bad parent in a courtroom and a hospital without even being monitored, notwithstanding all the health-detrimental forced labor that could have been caught if he were. PJ doesn't even hide the fact he's miserable at home, and on some occasions, it's obvious he desperately wants to leave.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> has a couple of examples, which are mostly explainable by the fact that the Gravity Falls police department is staggeringly incompetent:
<ul><li> At least every other episode, Stan does something that would get the twins sent right back home to their parents if the cops were the least bit capable at their jobs. At best, he tends to turn a blind eye to all the potentially dangerous shenanigans that Dipper and Mabel get up to, and at worst... it's outright stated that the three of them have spent at least one night in jail.
<ul><li> Later averted in that when the Mystery Shack is raided by government agents, one of the agents <em>does</em> intend to take Dipper and Mabel to Child Protective Services (though he doesn't see to realize that the twins have two loving parents). It's only because the agents are mind-wiped by the memory gun that the twins got to stay with Stan.
</li></ul></li><li> Pacifica's parents are <em>very</em> emotionally abusive, to the point that Pacifica is straight-up scared of displeasing them. Not to mention the fact that they basically trained her to respond with contrition whenever they ring a bell...
</li></ul></li><li> Despite the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneFantastic">pseudo-modern</a> setting of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarveyBeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HarveyBeaks">Harvey Beaks</a></em>, people simply let Fee and Foo live outdoors, albeit with the Beaks family being willing to provide for them (their usual sleeping quarters are the branches of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArborealAbode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArborealAbode">the tree the Beaks house is made from</a>). One episode focuses on Harvey getting them to move into the actual house, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">which all of them eventually agree against</a> (barring emergencies).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series can be somewhat bad at this. Arnold's grandmother and grandfather are incredibly weird, but social services never check up — although in the movie, his grandfather mentions that if they did step in, he and grandma would go into a nursing home and Arnold would go to a foster home, potentially because of their weirdness, though also because of their age (they're in their early 80s). However, Arnold did get plenty of love and care from his grandparents and the other residents of the boarding house do function as an extended family to him.
</li><li> Helga, meanwhile, is probably worse, given that her dad is mentally abusive (about as close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">Abusive Parents</a> as you can get while still being kid-friendly) and her mom is an alcoholic, constantly depressed, unaware of her surroundings, has no driver's license, and falls asleep in weird places after making "smoothies".
</li><li> Also, there's Stoop Kid. A kid who has apparently <em>never</em> left his stoop and appears to be in his teens. He's well known around the neighborhood, begging the question of why CPS never took issue with a child acting like a completely shut-in since birth.
</li></ul></li><li> Mako's and Bolin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackStory">Back Story</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em> implies there is no Social Services in Republic City, as "death of parents" = "orphans out on the street." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a>, as the era being emulated is an Asianized version of the 1920s, and that period predated such institutions.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Madeline">Madeline</a>: Lost in Paris</em>, the antagonist had apparently been lying to the courts for a while to keep the other girls locked up in the lace factory. Kinda surprising considering that, you know, it's <em>FRANCE</em>...
</li><li> Due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">Rule of Funny</a> being in full effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>, the parents get away with attitudes that would have caught the attention of social services in real life, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">such as locking their son out of the house because they think he brings bad luck</a> in one episode.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MoralOrel">Moral Orel</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama">plays this for drama</a>, as Orel and Shapey have never been sent to foster care in spite of their household circumstances. Clay <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">regularly emotionally and physically abuses Orel</a>, at one point having him shot in the leg and even prides himself of doing so <em>in the presence of the public</em>. Bloberta, while less bad than Clay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalNeglect">always allows Shapey to play with dangerous objects and ignores the dangerous circumstances Orel often gets himself into</a>. Other parents in Moralton are just as bad, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Doughy</a> constantly getting thrown out of his house by his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild">immature parents</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">Joe</a> not being sent to proper guardians after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nurse Bendy</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">left him</a> (he's raised by his 91-year-old immobilized father and apathetic half-sister). Since Moralton is shown to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApatheticCitizens">Apathetic Citizens</a>, it's tragically likely that either there <em>are</em> no social services, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfChildDisservices">the social services are unreliable at best</a>.
</li><li> Suga Momma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheProudFamily">The Proud Family</a></em> certainly treated Oscar pretty poorly. Likewise, Oscar does do <em>some</em> pretty terrible things to Penny, but most of the abuse Penny faces comes from her peers rather than her parents.
</li><li> The parents in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em> should not be allowed to keep their children, given all the unsupervised antics the <em>baby</em> protagonists get into. For example, they always leave Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil, Dil, and Kimi in a crib or playpen; they should've figured out that Tommy can break out of most playpens or cribs with his screwdriver quite easily <em>ages</em> ago. The only supervision they use 90 percent of the time is Grandpa Lou, a borderline narcoleptic (he falls asleep at the drop of a hat). Often, when they're in a store, they'll put the babies down on the floor (again, with no one to watch them), and walk off <em>in the opposite direction</em>. One of the worst examples is when Stu and Grandpa Lou took Tommy to a baseball game in <em>Baseball</em> — he ended up <em>part</em> of the game, and could've easily been killed if he didn't fall into the player's mitt, all because the two were too engrossed in their game, and it was caught on camera and live TV to boot! And when they took the babies to the musical in <em>Reptar on Ice</em>, the kids managed to sneak onto the ice itself (and Tommy is <em>barefoot</em>, no pants or shoes for the freezing ice), because Stu and Didi fell asleep during the show and Lou was too engrossed in it. To make a long story short, if they weren't in a cartoon, all four/six of them would be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">DEAD</a></em> due to the neglect their parents give them.
</li><li> Homer Simpson of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> is a close second for king of this trope, although to his credit he finally cleans up his act in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>.
<ul><li> This was poked fun at in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimatedActors">behind the scenes</a> style episode, where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> of an angry Homer choking was a left-in ad-lib casually described as a surprisingly amusing act of child abuse.
</li><li> In another episode, this trope was evoked even when the law was involved. A judge emancipated Bart because Homer was such a bad father, saying she had no choices besides that and letting Homer keep custody of Bart.
</li><li> It's not that there's no child services, they even moved the kids when they suspected severe abuse on both parents' ends, it's just that things worked out and most of the neglect and abuse are for the sake of a gag, while plot-wise Homer does take care of his children and he will bond with Bart when they both decide to not mess with each other.
</li><li> In a specific example, in the episode <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E23HomersEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E23HomersEnemy">Homer's Enemy</a></em>, part of Frank Grimes ridiculously miserable backstory involved being abandoned by his parents at age four and thus never having the money to go to school; instead having to spend his childhood working by delivering toys, he never got to play with, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">rich children.</a> In real life, children are mandated by law to go school, and child labor would prevent a four-year-old from being made to work.
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much every adult in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> is an idiot who barely supervises their kids at all. Well, except for Butters' family, who are just <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">completely</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">abusive</a> assholes</em> who have viciously beat him on at least one occasion.
<ul><li> In the season six episode "Child Abduction is Not Funny", the parents collectively banish all the kids from town out of fear that <em>they</em> themselves will abduct their own children! Even the mayor does not question this.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> has a loving family. However, he doesn't go to school, despite being twelve at the start. He apparently has never even <em>heard</em> of school and neither have the Gems. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is he's homeschooled but he still doesn't seem to have any formal education.
<ul><li> Greg does regularly visit Steven and considering that they interact with the Mayor, there doesn't seem to be any problems. Later episodes reveal Greg helped build the house Steven lives in and it's most likely that Steven is registered as home-schooled and under Greg's guardianship.
</li><li> Regarding the homeschool issue though, it is at least pretty well done. One comic had Steven follow Connie to school and it turns out that Steven is the second-smartest student in the class, behind Connie herself, so the education does seem to be valid. Another episode has Greg and Steven talking about college. Steven points out he is too busy protecting the world with the Gems to really go to college, but Greg does add he could get Steven online courses, which Steven doesn't object to.
</li><li> Perhaps more concerning, before Greg builds the house adjoining the temple, it's in-show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">Canon</a> that he and Steven live in his van, even when Steven is a newborn. And this is a setting where harsh winters appear to be reasonably common - in one episode they're only actually living indoors during a snowstorm because Vidalia asked Greg to housesit while she was away. Would it have been that hard to find an apartment for a few years, dude?!
</li></ul></li><li> Sari Sumdac of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. Despite being the daughter of a very prominent businessman, no one in the bureaucracy has ever picked up on the fact that she <em>legally doesn't exist</em>. Moreover, when her father goes missing, not only is there no attempt to provide her with an adult guardian, but she's <em>thrown out of her home</em> by the business's new CEO. It's okay, though, because she moves in with a bunch of giant alien robots with no legal status on Earth. Yeaaaah.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder13');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder13" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> It is a common refrain that while Social Services do exist, they are not adequate to the task and many cases are handled too slowly or get lost in the bureaucracy. This can arise from insufficient funding, poor management and oversight, or the simple fact that even without those obstacles the work is grueling, difficult, often thankless, and not a high prestige occupation, so there are simply not enough social workers to go around.
<ul><li> Furthermore, abuse can be difficult to define and even harder to prove. The difference between, say, corporal punishment as justified disciplining or abuse can be highly subjective; for example, spanking is abuse to some people and normal behavior to others. Various forms of emotional abuse naturally leave no physical evidence and happen in private, leading to the parent's word against the accusers. Children themselves are even less reliable than adults as witnesses. The authorities may well try to investigate and prosecute only to discover they have no leg to stand on legally. Finally, even when services exist many people are afraid to call, fearing retaliation by the parents in question, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbuseMistake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbuseMistake">Abuse Mistake</a>, or generally just making a fuss. There is considerable social inertia to not interfere with parenting, much less separate a child from their mother or father.
<ul><li> There is also considerable disproportionate representation of minority children in child welfare, in the United States. The reasons are debated but broadly considered consequences of institutional racism. So perception of Child Services' competency and pervasiveness can vary between different communities that are divided largely by race and class.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> A more literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> for much of the world. Various places may well not even have such agencies or are so underfunded and understaffed they effectively don't exist.
<ul><li> This was the case early on in the US, as the story of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Ellen_Wilson">Mary Ellen Wilson<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> will tell you. To elaborate even further, there were no good child protective laws or agencies, this being 1874. So, with the help of the ASPCA's founder Henry Bergh, she was removed from her home, and her adoptive mother was jailed. Later on, Henry Bergh went on to found several CPS agencies, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Children">NYSPCC<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being the first.
</li></ul></li><li> This is a <em>major</em> source of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> between Western countries and Japan. In Japan, in the interests of social harmony, the basic rule regarding abuse, neglect and bullying is "don't make waves." In Western countries, other authority figures will step in relatively quickly (in theory). Of course there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Columbine">always</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NevilleChamberlain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NevilleChamberlain">exceptions</a>. Japan's foster care system is tiny and pretty shit, largely because most potential foster parents consider it such an insult to be subject to government oversight that they drop the whole thing, and back before there was oversight (late forties/early fifties) the abuse problems were truly horrific. Historically they had a flourishing fostering system, but that was a way for rich people to get excess offspring out of the way while training up their heirs. Some of the old fostering villages take orphans for the government these days, but not nearly enough.
</li><li> Author and motivational speaker David Pelzer made his name with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChildCalledIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AChildCalledIt">memoirs</a> of his abusive childhood. While he <em>did</em> get rescued by Social Services eventually, they seemed to have not kept an eye on him at all despite how often he came to school with his various bodily injuries and signs of starvation. According to him anyways, his work has been criticized as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">exaggerated or inaccurate</a> as the tale is remarkably clear on some points but lacking in certain details that would make it verifiable. His brother Richard supports the tale, having become a victim after his brother, but other family members have denied it.
</li><li> When <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Likens">Sylvia Likens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was being tied up and tortured in Gertrude Banizewski's basement, Jenny Likens wrote to their older sister Diane, pleading for help. Diane initially assumed that Jenny was just kicking up a fuss because she didn't like being left while their parents were traveling, but finally stopped in to check up on the girls. She arrived to find that Sylvia had "run away", according to Gertrude, and Jenny was too afraid to talk to her. When she contacted social services, they failed to help at all. Her death is the reason for many mandatory reporting laws, and why follow-up is required in response to tips about child abuse.
