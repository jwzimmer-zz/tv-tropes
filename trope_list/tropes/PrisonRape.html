Let's just say the ads were not received favorably...
</li><li> This is increasingly the attitude in the United States towards these types of ads as well, as critics have noted that officials seem to treat rape as part of the punishment, instead of, you know, a problem that prison officials need to be cracking down on. Needless to say, such an institutionalized punishment would be in violation of a small thing called the U.S. Constitution...

Five guys and 3 weeks in the prison infirmary. That said, it was back when he was just a small-time thug and it was one of the reasons behind his taking a level in bad-ass.
<ul><li> Once Fisk gets out of jail, he finds the thug's wife and has her gang-raped by the filthiest hobos he can find, taking pictures all the while, which he sends to the thug.

</li><li> This has become almost a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer">Hellblazer</a></em>:
<ul><li> During the story about the Devil's Confession, there is reference to a young hippie being "buggered eleven times on his first night inside," which prompted his attempted suicide.
</li><li> During the <em>Son of Man</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a>, John Constantine and Chaz Chandler are pursued by a huge demon called a "fuckpig", supposedly the act of rape given form. John comments that, as the creature is sexually aggressive, massively endowed, and black in color (coal-black, as it happens), this experience could represent prison-rape anxiety. Even though the story was set in London and it's usually U.S. prisons that are depicted as controlled by violent black gangs. He's pretty obviously joking, anyway, as he follows up the comment with "I said it was very Freudian, Chas. I didn't say it actually meant anything."
</li><li> In the story arc <em>Hard Time</em>, John is incarcerated in an <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em>-like prison in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth">Deep South</a> where he is sexually menaced by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryBlackMan">Scary Black Man</a> named Traylor. John later magically causes a rioting mob of prisoners to see Traylor as a Hot Black Chick and gang-bang him (John's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinetiesAntiHero">'90s Anti-Hero</a>; he doesn't have to be nice).

Once he escapes, he travels back in time and molests one of the heroes as a teenager as part of his battle strategy.
</li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> ally Joe "Robbie" Robertson gets jailed by the machinations of Tombstone, the hulking inmate Bruiser decides that Robbie will become his "very close friend". In an immediate backpedal/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">Author's Saving Throw</a>, it's quickly revealed/retconned that Bruiser has only platonic friendship in mind since Robbie <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">reminds him of his brother</a>, along with hasty denials in the letter column. But that's not what was ''very'" clearly implied in the original scene.
<ul><li> Spidey villain, third rank villain mind, Tombstone was being pestered by Kangaroo in prison. Tombstone set it up so that Kangaroo got stuck in a wall chasing him. Then three big burly inmates show up, and... yeah.
</li><li> Also, when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackCat">Black Cat</a> was finally arrested and sent to prison, it was not-too-subtly implied the other inmates had a "thing" for her.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> had a <em>Christmas Special</em> backup where the perp he's chasing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGoingBackToPrison" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverGoingBackToPrison">has vowed not to go back to prison</a> due to his prior experiences there. Since the Punisher has promised not to kill on Christmas (that year), he drugs the guy and turns him over to the cops, saying "Learn to sleep with one eye open". The Punisher does this <em>while dressed as Santa Claus</em>, just to make it even more disturbing.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> MAX</em> series, this nearly happens to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">O'Brien</a> after she is sent back to prison, but she fights off her attackers repeatedly. However, they then frame her for murder in revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> Gina experiences the rare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a></em>, complete with soap-dropping. She remembers not to bend over to pick it up, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy">kneeling in a women's prison isn't much better</a>. However the inmates who attempted to molest her crash into a large inmate while chasing after her. The pissed off woman proceeds to violently rape all three of them at once.
<ul><li> though judging by how she acts towards Barbara in the library, it seems clear that <em>something</em> happened...
</li></ul></li><li> The "don't drop the soap" gag was used in the mini-series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumLivingHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArkhamAsylumLivingHell">Arkham Asylum: Living Hell</a></em>, where recently incarcerated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> Warren White finds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a> in the same shower area as him. The panicked Warren indeed drops the soap... only for the Joker to politely hand it back to him and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">chew him out verbally for using stock frauds to take other people's kids' college funds</a>.
<ul><li> It's later implied he becomes Two-Face's prison bitch, although they only show him flipping his coin for him while Two-Face recovers from a hand injury. Disturbingly, becoming the bitch of a member of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoguesGallery">Rogues Gallery</a> for protection is actually suggested to him <em>by a member of the infirmary staff</em>, who euphemistically refers to it as a "Super Villain Team-Up".
</li></ul></li><li> Killer Moth was apparently the laughing stock in prison for being apprehended by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a>, and implies this happened to him as a result.
<ul><li> Or at least that's what somebody claiming to be him says. Two pages later, Babs tells him Killer Moth is locked up in Arkham, and looks nothing like him (or even human).
</li></ul></li><li> One of the viewpoint characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneHundredBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneHundredBullets">100 Bullets</a></em> is sent to prison at one point. He promptly rapes and kills his cellmate just to make it clear to the other prisoners what sort of man they're dealing with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Starman">Starman</a></em>, during the space quest arc, the characters are sent to a space prison, one huge alien starts taking an interest in Jack. Jack rhetorically asks what the big guy's deal is, and when Mikaal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhetoricalQuestionBlunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhetoricalQuestionBlunder">starts to answer</a>, interrupts him with "Yeah, I've seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em>."
</li><li> Combined with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">Marital Rape License</a> (yes, that trope) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Persepolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Persepolis">Persepolis</a></em>: since it's illegal in fundamentalist Iran to execute virgins, and out of a belief that virgins can't go to hell, a female convict is quickly married off to a member of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice">Secret Police</a> and raped by her 'husband' to take her virginity before being executed. Then, to hammer the point home, a pittance of a dowry is sent to her family. This happening to a person they knew, coupled with the fear that it could happen to Marjane, is one of <em>many</em> reasons Marjane's parents send her to Austria.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Kaijumax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Kaijumax">Kaijumax</a></em> has Zonn pulling the closest kaiju equivalent to this trope by stabbing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Electrogor</span> in the head with an ovipositor and laying an egg inside it.

While in Mingo City incognito, she and Zarkov get caught up in a mass arrest by Ming's secret police who are searching for Flash, and while they are locked up in the prison, Dale is spotted in her cell by its evil overlord Hong, who then arranges for her to be taken to his office for "questioning". Fortunately Flash, who has staged a prison break-in with a band of rebels, comes to her rescue in the nick of time and disposes of the despicable warden with his fists.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Illuminatus">Illuminatus!</a></em> trilogy. The appearance of Harry Coin is greeted with "It's safe to assume that anyone you meet in prison is a homosexual" and sure enough, Harry wants to bugger his new cellmate before they've even been introduced.

</li><li> Discussed in King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStand">The Stand</a></em> as to the reason why Trash Can Man's mother and stepfather (the sheriff) couldn't send him to juvenile hall for his arson activities without leaving with a "size eleven asshole".
</li><li> A particularly nasty version of prison rape plays a significant part in the brilliant and repulsive short story <em>I Am Infinite, I Contain Multitudes</em>, by Douglas Clegg.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaleBrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaleBrown">Dale Brown</a> novel <em>Storming Heaven</em>, the male terrorist villain Henri Cazaux was arrested by U.S. soldiers on a base in Belgium as a teenager and repeatedly raped by them over two days. Needless to say, this provides him with plenty of motivation to hate the United States and also decide he will never be caught alive.
</li><li> The most horrifying instance of rape in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Outlander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Outlander">Outlander</a></em> series (occurring in the first book, nonetheless, set in the mid-18th century) takes place in prison but is not precisely prison rape, more of a version of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScarpiaUltimatum">Scarpia Ultimatum</a> where both parties are male. Claire, the female love interest (from the 1940s — it's a long story) is... about as disturbed as one would expect, as the rape comes at the hands of a particularly sadistic villain. The same villain is implied to have been doing so for some time now to his other captives, at least one of whom commits suicide after.

This trope was subverted when Reacher nearly kills the leader of a gang in his cell, as well as several Aryans in the showers.
</li><li> A Joseph Wambaugh short story had a cop constantly worrying that his crazy partner's "unorthodox" style of law enforcement would get them both sent to prison, where he, the sane one, was certain he'd be repeatedly raped. His anxiety about this, and his over-the-top references to how stretched-out he expected his anus to get, were played for laughs.

Needless to say, they are excited by the prospect of sweaty groping in the dark by buff men.

<ul><li> An episode of entitled "Fallacy" deals with a pre-operative transgender fighting not to be sent to prison because she fears the men there will rape her. She's sent to jail and ends up in critical care by the end of the episode, having been brutally gang raped by the other inmates - and destined to keep suffering through this for the rest of her sentence. Oddly, at no point does anyone but her seem to realize that she presents a <em>ridiculously</em> large target for this.
</li><li> In the generally so-bad-it's-good "Wildlife" episode, Stabler and Fin intimidate a rapper named "Gots Money" by rolling a pair of dice, implying that if he goes to prison his cellmate will do the same and then rape him a number of times corresponding to the dice roll.

</div></li><li> A similar episode had a prison rape victim driven to be a serial rapist, going around in his van, snatching men off the street, and raping them. Like the above example, the interviewed a group of lifers who owned "her."
</li><li> A recent episode sees the return of a date rapist who upon being caught, Elliot and Olivia bragged about how he was going to end up a prison bitch that gets passed around. Although they were mostly trying to scare him, the prisoners really do end up using him just like Olivia and Elliot say they would, resulting in him believing they deliberately set him up. Understandably, he's pissed.
</li><li> An earlier episode, "Taken", had a man raped and killed in prison after he was falsely accused of raping a 17-year-old girl by a family of con artists. To make matters worse Cragen had made a joke about it earlier in the episode saying that "if there is any karma, Ramsay won't be doing much sitting down in Riker's." Hearing the guy plead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/JohnMunch">John Munch</a> earlier in the episode was heartbreaking, and at the end, he seemed to be the only one in the cast to consider the possibility the guy was innocent until the con artist admitted that he was just a patsy.
</li><li> While not actually a prison, a minor was raped while in a mental health facility when his defense convinced the court that his rape of his teacher was caused by some sort of faulty brain set up. The kid's rapist then excused himself of the crime by claiming to have the exact same thing. Unlike most cases, however, something was actually done about it, though it was most likely due to the fact that the kid was still legally a minor.
</li><li> There was one episode where they had a teen suspect. Currently in the precinct's holding cell was a man arrested for molesting boys who was only too happy to play along with Stabler when he threatened the boy with leaving the two of them alone together, even though they would have been in full view of other officers.
</li><li> A more sensitive take comes in the episode "Undercover", in which Olivia <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">goes undercover</a> in a women's prison to find and expose a guard who's been raping inmates. He's eventually taken down, though not before he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NearRapeExperience">tries to rape Olivia</a> while she's posing as a prisoner.
</li><li> Although it's rarely a plot point in the flagship show, this is a favorite taunt or threat for the detectives (and sometimes even the prosecutors) to bring up when interrogating a particularly nasty, annoying, smug, stubborn, or otherwise unlikeable suspect / defendant.

<div class="indent"> <strong>McCoy</strong>: How many points do you think you'll be worth in prison?
</div></li><li> An episode involved a kid who received prison for some incredibly minor crime, but was so traumatized by the repeated gang rapes that he came out a killer. As is common in such cases, when McCoy goes to interview the Aryan Brotherhood lifers that abused him, they refer to the victim as "she."
</li><li> And in another episode where the defendant reveals that a prison guard had turned her into his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">Sex Slave</a> and that she had him killed because she couldn't put up with it anymore.

</li><li> British sketch comedy series <em>Swingers</em> featured the 'gay men enjoy prison' version, played for laughs: one ongoing storyline features a British man locked up in a foreign country who has obviously been enjoying whatever's been going on with his attractive young Latin cellmate. In fact, he's having so much fun he confesses to the crime he's been falsely accused of and to several <em>other</em> crimes...which comes back to bite him in the ass, as he learns soon after that his cellmate's violent older brother is being transferred to the same prison and is planning to do unpleasant things to the man who's been 'corrupting' his brother.

It cuts to the outside of the room at that point and we never hear what word he used, but the preceding words and the guy's reaction make it obvious what he was getting at.
</li><li> Also, when Alex is imprisoned. A sleazy defendant who she was prosecuting taunts her father and Walker about her "learning new skills" while in jail. The men's reaction is precisely what you'd expect from a woman's father and boyfriend. She is in fact attacked at one point, and while not a rape, the scene does give off this vibe

</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> when Sheldon Cooper - a character who might otherwise be thought to be vulnerable - is briefly imprisoned. Thrown into a holding cell, he is appraised by the other inmates in a way that he is oblivious to and which might not augur well if played for drama. Instead, Sheldon glares at the big, hard, tough looking con in the place nearest the door and says "You're in my spot". Figuring he's in the presence of a <em>real</em> maniac psycho who is throwing down a challenge, the tough-looking con surrenders the spot. Sheldon is unmolested.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OrangeIsTheNewBlack"> Orange Is the New Black</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subverted, as sex between inmates seen on the show is consensual. Discussed during "Bora Bora Bora" when the guards and inmates giving the tour pretend it's common, and also when Alex plays with Pennsatucky's fears of this.
</li><li> This is played for laughs when several of the prisoners are participating in a scared straight program, trying to frighten a group of adolescent delinquents into better behavior by telling them terrifying stories about life in prison. When protagonist Piper Chapman just happens to walk in on the group while on her way to use the bathroom, the other prisoners, trying to scare a particularly hardened delinquent, threaten to leave her with Chapman, describing her as a notorious lesbian rapist. It's funny because their description is so at odds with Chapman's real personality, and real reputation.
</li><li> There's also an episode in which Vause threatens to do this to Pennsatucky, although, from the way Vause phrases it, she makes it seem as though the real threat is that Pennsatucky, who has, shall we say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeteronormativeCrusader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeteronormativeCrusader">old-fashioned attitudes toward homosexuality</a>, will enjoy it so much that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAndSwitch">she will turn gay</a>.
</li><li> It's also subverted with Daya and Bennett. Their relationship is portrayed as entirely consensual, even though legally it's considered rape since an inmate can't consent to sex with a CO. This is why even though Daya seduced Mendez, he ended up in prison for rape.
</li><li> On the other hand, Mendez routinely trades drugs for sex, and attempts to pressure Sophia into this in exchange for hormones when the doctors cut her prescription off. Morello is terrified of him for this exact reason, and Diaz takes advantage of the popular opinion of Mendez to seduce him and then claim he raped her to cover up her pregnancy.

When confronted, George discusses how he was subjected to sexual abuse by the guards in the form of what was called a "dry bath" (essentially a cavity search) and when he attempted to fight back, was thrown down a flight of stairs. The other inmate (the dangerous criminal) witnessed this and used his influence to get the guards to leave Edalji alone. Doyle questions with a raised eyebrow what the other inmate expected in return, and Edalji reveals that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLearnedToRead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLearnedToRead">started teaching the guy to read</a> and has continued to do so now that both are out of prison.

Complete with cheerful chorus of female voices at the end.
</li><li> Similarly, the song "Date Rape" by Sublime tells a story of a man who rapes a girl he meets in a bar, goes to jail, and is in turn raped himself, in a sort of poetic justice. The singer says in the end that he can't really find it in himself to feel sorry for him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">after what he did.</a> For bonus points the music video casts porn star Ron Jeremy as both the judge and the prison rapist.

The title says it all, and the song features verses about being in prison along with the chorus "We're just two men as God had made us." Screaming and distorted vocals in the song give it a dark tone. The version from the Life On the Murder Scene EP has Gerard starting the song off by explaining it as being the story of a "beautiful boy who done went to jail". Just in case there was any hint of doubt.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BowlingForSoup">Bowling for Soup</a>'s video of "The Bitch Song" involves the band being sent to prison, with all that that and the song title implies (the song itself, however, is about the singer's girlfriend).

</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Nirvana">Nirvana</a>'s "Rape Me." The singer in this case is playing a victim of everyday non-prison rape, but the "I'm not the only one" line is directed at her attacker; he'll get his when he gets to jail. Or maybe Hell.
</li><li> Rich Hall's character, Otis Lee Crenshaw (a country and western singing former convict), begins one of his songs with the intro "Y'know, prison rape has always gotten kinda a bad name." (the song is called "He almost looks like you.")
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FrankZappa">Frank Zappa</a> album <em>Joe's Garage</em>, the protagonist Joe is "plooked" in prison during the song "Keep it Greasey." "Dong Work for Yuda," the preceding song, sings of Joe's rapist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetterInBed">generous gifts in the genitals department</a>, just so the audience knows how awful Joe's going to have it.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tool">tool</a> song "Prison Sex" is a subversion.

The sheriff says if they fess up, he might let the "lady" spend the night at his house; if they don't, he will chain up Gervas in a solitary cell and put the Porcelain Doctor together with the other prisoners. Gervas understands the threat, but the Porcelain Doctor is oblivious, and declines the offer. Averted with the fact that after he had been put together with the murderers, he easily fought them off, and Gervas breaks out of his own cell to pluck his friend out of trouble. Then they decide to stay in prison after all (breaking out would be a crime), so they leave the beaten guys in their relocked cell, and return to Gervas' slightly better one. They are still sleeping there when the real sheriff returns.

After having a meltdown on the set of his show while reviewing the atrocious <em>Ghost Chasers 3</em>, which included indecent exposure and telling L.A. street gangs to go murder the studio executives, Jay is sent to jail for 30 days, where it's implied this happens to him with his burly cellmate.

<ul><li> Tom DuBois is shown to suffer an extreme (and irrational) phobia of going to prison and getting raped there; this stems from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianExcuse">watching a prison movie with a graphic rape scene when he was a little kid</a>, which partly explains why he's such a straight-laced, law-abiding citizen (and also a prosecutor who ironically, has presumably sent other men to the fate he fears so much). On the downside, his wife Sarah is (sexually) frustrated by all of his constant anxiety.
</li><li> In "A Date with the Health Inspector" and "A Date with the Booty Warrior", Tom winds up seeing the inside of a jail twice (in the former episode, he was wrongly detained and questioned by the police for a crime he didn't commit; and in the latter one, he was chaperoning several boys on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareEmStraight">Scare 'Em Straight</a> field trip to a local prison). And in both instances, he worries about the possibility of almost getting anally raped (the latter time was justified, because <em>there really was</em> a rapist who was out to get him). But thankfully, he comes out of both misadventures with his ass intact.

It was slipping all over the place." This is of course followed by two prisoners pointing and laughing at Peter for his inability to hang onto the soap.
</li><li> Subverted again in "One If by Clam, Two If by Sea"; after being framed for arson of a British pub, many of the inmates are commenting that they intend to rape Peter. Peter, however, is taking all of the comments as compliments, appearing to be completely unaware of their intent, until he says, "they are going to be bummed to know I'm not gay but everyone is so nice here".
</li><li> Played for laughs in "Airport '07", where Peter mentions that he's so happy Quagmire got his job as a pilot back that he doesn't even mind that he got raped in federal prison, where he was sent for hijacking a plane.
</li><li> Subverted in "Fast Times At Buddy Cianci Jr. High", when Lois worries about Chris being sent to prison because she's seen <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oz">Oz</a></em> and knows what goes on in prison showers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackTwist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashbackTwist">Cut</a> to a scene of prisoners happily singing a parody of "The Wonderful Land of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWizardOfOz">Oz</a>" while soaping each others' backs in a completely chaste manner.
</li><li> After Meg gets back from prison she has apparently learnt all about prison rape and she calmly steps into the shower with her naked father, and rapes him with a loofah to assert her dominance.
</li><li> They did a gag about the "real" ending of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing">Dirty Dancing</a></em> where Baby's parents sent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DawsonCasting">Johnny</a> to jail and he is lustfully licked by his cellmate while "Hungry Eyes" plays.
</li><li> It's also played straight in two parodies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">homage episode</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing">Stephen King</a>; in which appeared three Stephen King's stories acted by the characters.
</li><li> And in a cutaway gag parodying <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption">The Shawshank Redemption</a></em> with the Monopoly Man.
</li></ul></li><li> Another gag had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrMagoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MrMagoo">Mr. Magoo</a> note he can't go to prison because they'll rape him and he won't see it coming.
</li></ul></li><li> Played horrifyingly straight in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheClevelandShow">The Cleveland Show</a></em> where Cleveland is put in prison for a murder he didn't commit, and the rest of the episode revolves around Freight Train, Junior, and Rollo solving the murder (Freight Train moonlights as a detective novelist and plans to turn the mystery into a story). Cut to 14 months later at the book release party where Donna suddenly remembers that <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingWeForgot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SomethingWeForgot">they forgot to get Cleveland released!</a></em> It then cuts to Cleveland, crying and putting on makeup in his jail cell while singing "What A Wonderful World" in a shaky, traumatized voice.

<ul><li> One odd variation is the occasional suggestion that a homosexual character would enjoy prison for this reason. For example, on one episode, there is a comment about Smithers "taking quickly" to a Turkish prison, and at the end of the remake of <em>The In-Laws</em>, one of the heroes comments that the flamboyant villain is going to "love" prison.
</li><li> Also hinted at in a throwaway joke in "The Bob Next Door", when Sideshow Bob tells Bart about how he stole his cellmate's identity <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FaceOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FaceOff">(it wasn't pretty)</a> to break out of prison: The cellmate asked Bob why he kept measuring his face with a caliper, to which Bob replied "Just passing the time." The cellmate then remarked "I guess it beats what the last guy did."
</li><li> When Krusty was working an awards show and Bob won the award, he sneered at Krusty (from a live feed from the prison), "This is one more than you'll ever win!" Krusty shot back, "Just don't drop that thing in the shower, Bob!"
</li><li> In their retelling of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo">The Count of Monte Cristo</a></em>, Homer is sent to prison and has Burns as his cellmate. Burns gives him an escape route and a map to his treasure. When Homer asks why Burns is helping him, he explains he wants to know he had at least one friend in his life and he also wants to make up for the fact that while Homer slept, Burns violated him repeatedly.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CloneHigh">Clone High</a></em> had Gandhi being accidentally incarcerated. He was very nervous about prison rape, especially because the other inmates kept ominously referring to the shower. When they finally cornered him for his 'initiation', it was completely innocent, of the 'three cheers' variety. They then listened, sympathetically, as he discussed his grief over the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TonightSomeoneDies">death</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongLostUncleAesop">Ponce de Leon</a>. It was hilarious. When this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">revealed</a>, one inmate says "Damn, boy! What'd you think we were going to do? Make LOVE to you?" And then they all laugh, except for one guy who just keeps creepily staring at Gandhi...
</li><li> This was frequently implied to happen to the title character's father on the Canadian cartoon <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KevinSpencer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KevinSpencer">Kevin Spencer</a></em> during his frequent trips to the slammer.
</li><li> Despite its setting and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFullOfGay">Cast Full of Gay</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em> doesn't invoke this as often as you'd think it would. In fact, two gay inmates are among the few recurring prisoners — and their sex is nothing if not consensual. However, this is an off-screen mention by one of them asking, "how do you not watch a shower rape?"
</li><li> Implied to have happened to Doctor Rockso in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Metalocalypse">Metalocalypse</a></em>: a guard finds him shaking and huddling in his cellmate's sleeping arms.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em> The Monarch wakes up in prison to find that he was about to be raped by King Gorilla (an actual gay gorilla). However, King admits he couldn't go through with it; Monarch reminds him too much of a girl. To make the scene even more bizarre, Monarch then realizes that he's not even in his own cell. Apparently, King Gorilla has enough pull with the guards to bring his "dates" over to his place.
</li><li> In the 90's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> short "Carrotblanca", at the end Yosemite Sam is thrown in jail and a dopey-looking prisoner suddenly gains a pair of eyelashes and smiles at him in a lustful way and Sam yells for help.

<ul><li> When SpongeBob tries to get Gary to take a bath (disguised as a treasure chest), he says that the soap is dubloons and tells him not to drop them (while winking).
</li><li> Implied at the end of "Patrick! The Game" to soon happen to Squidward when he's put in the back of a police truck with a burly prisoner.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeMonkeys">Code Monkeys</a></em> where the cast (including the girls) gets sent to prison, named "Rapeville State Penitentiary".

</li><li> Azula's <strong>notorious</strong> "favourite prisoner" comment (which, it should be noted, was in reference to Suki). There is no possible way that the writers were unaware of the implications of <em>that</em>, and the animators and voice actor went with it in the delivery.

While Katara and Sokka go to clear his name, there's a shot of Aang in prison, where a group of huge, tough-looking convicts talk about how they think Aang's going to get along <em>really</em> well with them. Cue cut to a different scene. When the episode gets back to Aang, we see <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that the convicts have, indeed, become friends with him and are kindly giving him relationship advice about his crush on Katara.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">Double Subverted</a> in the episode "Meeseeks and Destroy". When Rick and Morty are being tried in giant court on murder charges, Rick mentioned that if somebody dropped the soap in giant prison that it'd land on their heads and crush their spines, and that it would be real easy to rape them after that.
</li><li> "You know what they do to third-dimensional lifeforms in Time Prison? Same thing they do in regular prison, only forever!"
</li></ul></li><li> At the end of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "The Terrible Trio", when we see Warren Lawford, aka the Fox, put into a prison cell this is the implication of what's to come given a sinister amused grin given by his new rather burly cellmate. Especially ironic since the last we saw of Lawford, he was bragging about how his rich family would get him off scot-free.
</li><li> Subverted in an episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EarthwormJim">Earthworm Jim</a></em> cartoon. Jim, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">through a series of events as outlandish as they are hilarious</a>, finds himself in prison without his supersuit. When he is introduced to his cellmate, Walter, the man reaches for Jim with an amourous grin...before using Jim as dental floss. And judging by Jim's screams, it is not pleasant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> hinted at this trope at the end of the episode "CatDog Catcher". Rancid Rabbit ends up incarcerated after spending the episode jailing everyone in Nearburg for not owning a license for their species (all just so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty">he'd have enough gold coins to bathe in</a>). He has a burly cellmate standing behind him who grabs him from off-screen as the episode irises out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHead">Beavis and Butt-Head</a></em> had an episode where Todd is hiding at the duo's house, and being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UngratefulBastard">Ungrateful Bastard</a> that he is, when they call him from jail (after getting beaten up by the cops and arrested for obstruction of justice because they wouldn't say where Todd was), he just tells them "don't drop the soap". They don't get raped, but instead end up in the same cell as two other gang members who hate Todd and proceed to beat them up again.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChamberlainHeights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendsOfChamberlainHeights">Legends of Chamberlain Heights</a></em>:
<ul><li> Parodied in the season 2 finale when the three main characters end up in jail for armed robbery (they didn't do it, but confess anyway in the hopes of attracting women). After being transferred from juvie to regular prison, rape becomes a serious concern, and each character finds some way of fitting in; most notably, Jamal discovers that the gay clique in the prison AREN'T gay, none of them are, they just act that way because if someone WANTS gay sex, it's no challenge for the rapists. Jamal immediately joins their side and starts acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> as possible.
<div class="indent"><strong>Rapist:</strong> Now, who wants this dick? <br/><strong>Jamal:</strong> Me! Dicks dicks dicks dicks!! <br/><strong>Rapist:</strong> Ew, fucking slut! <em>[leaves]</em>
</div></li><li> Also, during visiting hours, Grover's big brother Montrel tells him that if he does get raped and doesn't tell anyone about it, it never happened. He also assumes Grover called him over there because he DID get raped and now wants to marry his rapist.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OhYeahCartoons">Oh Yeah! Cartoons</a></em>, of all things, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">referenced this</a> in the short "Earth to Obie", where Obie's imagination sequence of being in jail for his cereal addiction at one point has an inmate heard calling Obie "sweet cheeks" and making kissy sounds.
