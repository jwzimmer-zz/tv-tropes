Between those four elements, effecting change for the better is about as possible as pushing over a mountain. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Godhand and the Idea of Evil that created them only exist because humanity can't accept that their suffering comes from no particular source.

But there's also a great deal of government corruption and organized crime.
</li><li> The world of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrayLittleDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrayLittleDevil">Stray Little Devil</a></em> has a basic flaw: the Law of the Conservation of Luck. The Law states that an angel's good luck is a devil's bad luck, and vice versa. In practice, this means that helping out a member of the opposite species will cause bad things to happen to you, which is one of the primary reasons why angels and devils are so hostile to each other.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akumetsu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akumetsu">Akumetsu</a></em>, pretty much all of Akumetsu's targets claim that they are little pieces in a great puzzle, powerless to do anything to improve Japan's lot despite the high positions they almost invariably have. He refuses to accept that as an adequate excuse for sparing them.
</li><li> The shinobi villages of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> face a constant cycle of hatred and war due to their nature. Attempts by individuals to improve the situation are usually met with even greater violence than the usual cycle, resulting in an even larger backlash. It is prophesied that one of Jiraiya's students will break this cycle either by saving the world from the violence... or by destroying it utterly.
<ul><li> Pain in particular was so jaded that his plan to achieve peace was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to nuke the entire world into a subsistence state, thus destroying the system, and nuke them again any time they started getting uppity so nobody would ever have the will or ability to fight again</span>. He recognized that this system was also inherently flawed, but felt it was still better.
</li><li> Tobi and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the real Madara</span> are so jaded that they believe the only way to achieve peace is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">mind control everyone into a state of illusory bliss.</span> They have completely given up on the real world.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, the way the military works essentially guarantees that the people who are the most qualified to fight Titans are also the ones least likely to ever fight them. It also ensures that the people who would be most likely to fight other humans are the least qualified to do so. Annie points out that any system that relies on <em>everyone</em> being a paragon of virtue is flawed.
<ul><li> And <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Kingdom of Marley's</span> simultaneous hatred of humans with the potential to become titans and its over-reliance of titan-shifters has left it screwed up, ultra-violent, and desperate to take on a new world superpower just to keep itself from collapsing before being pillaged by its rivals.
</li><li> Eren eventually comes to the conclusion that as long as slavery is still a concept, then things like the enslavement of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ymir Fritz</span> and the oppression both <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eldia <em>and</em> Marley</span> inflicted will manifest themselves in new ways. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So he decides to nuke the system. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">And everyone outside Paradis who could possibly bring it back.</a></span>

The supposedly utopian mages show their true colors when dealing with Norma, and even close friends and family will turn their fangs given enough time. This isn't because all mages are born assholes, as they're capable of compassion and understanding that erodes quickly under prejudice. The real problem is that <em>mana is a drug</em>; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Embryo designed the mages for utilization of mana, which is actually zero-point dimensional energy in the form of nanomachines, with the added side effect of eroding the willpower of mages who use mana extensively. In addition, since Embryo has full control over all mana, he can force subliminal messages into mages as they cast their daily spells and unwittingly dominate what little willpower remains, turning all but the most loyal mages into xenophobic sadists</span>, which makes mana use the main cause of all the irrational hatred in the series. Unfortunately, the mages require mana to function as a peaceful society, and devolve into raving bandits without it.

<ul><li> In content cut from the original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KingdomCome">Kingdom Come</a></em> but included in the trade paperback, Superman goes to Apokolips; it is revealed that Orion had killed Darkseid and taken his place. Orion had tried to give the people freedom, however, after countless years under Darkseid's rule, the people of Apokalips simply <em>couldn't bear to live without a despot</em>. Orion eventually (and at first, reluctantly), steps in to fulfill the same role as his father. However, Scott Free and Barda seem to have a fairly free hand in pushing anti-Orion propaganda, implying that future generations of Apokolips residents may in fact throw off despotic rule.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>, a combination of an oppressive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState">Police State</a> government, mass unemployment, and chronic overcrowding lead millions of people to simply freak out and turn to crime out of boredom and/or despair. It is often said that Dredd's main enemy is not Judge Death, PJ Maybe, Orlok, or Mean Machine, but Mega-City One itself. All attempts to reform it somehow have ultimately fallen flat and simply reinforced the status quo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PaperinikNewAdventures">Paperinik New Adventures</a></em>, the Evronians are plagued by this: they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionEater">feed off emotions</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredByAForsakenChild">even part of their technology is powered by those</a>, but, aside from the Emperor and the Imperial Council, don't produce much of it (and those who aren't the Emperor or Councillors who develop a full emotional spectrum are hunted down and killed), so they have to take it from other species. It's implied the problem is empowering so much of their tech with emotional energy, and that without it they could simply absorb little energy from other people without harming them and even feed off nonsentient species, but the only alternative they've found is reducing Xadhoom to a power source... And given that Xadhoom is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGoddess">Physical Goddess</a> hellbent on killing them all for what they did to her homeworld, that's easier said than done.
<ul><li> The final issue of the reboot indicates that part of the problem is the militaristic culture of the Evronians, as when the timeline is changed with the prevention of the creation of the Guardians of the Galaxy the early Evronians, without an enemy capable of standing against them, did not develop a militaristic culture, and in present time they're peacefully integrated with the galactic society, with those with a full emotional spectrum free to walk around.
</li></ul></li><li> Gotham City, <em>especially</em> its police force and judicial system, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a></em> has long been portrayed this way, especially during the early days of Batman's career, as seen in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>. The city was completely in the pocket of the mob, especially the Falcone family, and the police were so thoroughly corrupt that Jim Gordon was assaulted on at least two separate occasions because his fellow officers didn't like him, you know, enforcing the law. It took Gordon and Batman years of work to even put a dent in the corruption and make the system semi-functional, and even to this day it's not up to the standards of Metropolis or other DC cities, with the exception of Hub City, home of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheQuestion">The Question</a>, which is even worse and basically a third world country.

People like Gang Orca or Shu have limited job opportunities and face discrimination for their appearances. Flashy Quirks are put at the top of society whereas people with subtle or dangerous quirks can be treated as potential supervillains.
<ul><li> It turns out to be a large part of why All for One became a supervillain. His willingness to question authority and protests against banning his quirk in public caused the government to target him. They ordered his own brother to hunt him down. It ended quite badly for everyone involved.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>: According to Agent Smith, both this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed">Humans Are Flawed</a> form the logic behind the dystopian design of the simulated world of the Matrix. The initial design of the Matrix was to be a utopia, but abandoned when no one would accept it and kept trying to "wake up"-this caused massive human casualties. Evidently, human beings just weren't physiologically and/or psychologically capable of living in an ideal world. Surprisingly though, this trope is actually <em>not</em> a major theme of the series: what irks the rebels most about the Matrix and what most spurs them to fight it isn't the fact that it uses their bodies for energy or that it's a massive lie; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking">the main reason they're trying to free people from the Matrix</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToNature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToNature">is because the Matrix isn't real.</a>
</li><li> Discussed further in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixReloaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrixReloaded">The Matrix Reloaded</a></em>: The Architect of the matrix explains that there have been <em>six</em> The Ones, each resetting the system and rebuilding Zion after the machines purge most of the main base. Because of the <em>flawed nature of human beings</em>, the second matrix was designed like Agent Smith says, but still failed. Then the Oracle stepped up and made a suggestion; human choice. As a result, 99% of the population chose to stay in the third matrix, but for three whole matrices, The One would appear and make choices that brought about the destruction of Zion despite numerous attempts to negotiate or impede their progress, and each time, they had the opportunity to doom all of humanity for a selfish decision. The Architect concludes that a system governed by free will, while surprisingly effective, is still flawed because the system will eventually allow dissenting rebels to rise up and wreak chaos - and eventually, one of them will choose what they love over the rest of humanity. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Neo is that one</span>.

The world-encompassing City was created to fulfill the promise of having as many children as you want, a fundamental wish for the clan-oriented Han society. The drawback: you don't get to see the sky and the sun, all birds are in cages, the very nature of the City makes it impossible to improve without physically tearing it down.

<ul><li> The beauty/horror of IngSoc and Big Brother being that they have essentially locked everyone into their roles by inverting the levels of oppression.

Things like chasing off tenants from the land where their family lived for generations happen not because anyone wants it, but because the financial system doesn't allow an alternative. As a bank executive puts it:
<div class="indent">The bank is something else than men. It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It's the monster. Men made it, but they can't control it.

<ul><li> Law enforcement: Police brass are only interested in looking good to their superiors, which means they are constantly directing their subordinates to focus on short-sighted actions that will temporarily produce favorable statistics while failing to address the roots of crime.
</li><li> Drug gangs: Greed to control more of the drug trade will always drive the gangs to war with each other over territory, perpetuating the cycle of violence that imperils profits and cuts lives short.
</li><li> Labor unions: The dockworkers aren't making enough money to support themselves, but can't rehabilitate their industry without political capital, which they're too poor to afford, so they have to resort to criminal connections, which do further damage to the dockworkers' position.
</li><li> Local government: To keep their jobs, politicians must be more concerned about getting re-elected than actually governing well. Everything they do is dictated by how it will play to voters, affect their fundraising, and earn them political alliances. If they don't play the game, they'll get voted out and replaced by someone who does.
</li><li> Public education: Teachers, just like cops, are under pressure by top officials to produce favorable statistics rather than do their real jobs. Their time is taken up by manipulating standardized testing practices and scores to give the illusion of quality education while actually leaving many students behind.
</li><li> The media: Sensational and low-quality online reporting is making it harder and harder for journalists to do their jobs. The managers of once-prominent newspapers are slashing their budgets and staff while focusing on shallow stories to compete with the rest of the industry in a race to the bottom.

The reactor itself saw many corner cuttings and procedural skips in order to appease the Soviet government along with promises of bonus payments through finishing it before the deadline. The intolerance towards dissent meant that whistleblowers were tried for providing honest critiques, and facts were embellished to impress the superiors. These factors behind the Chernobyl meltdown also applied to the recovery process, which had proven to be more expensive in terms of man and resources due to bureaucratic mismanagement and lack of clarity on an actual crisis causing unnecessary setbacks.

The Shapers do their best to control it but never quite can, while making themselves look like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">complete bastards</a> in the process. Eventually, a sect develops that wants to eliminate shaping entirely... but given that shaping is completely ingrained into the society and the first game reminds us that "you cannot unring a bell," you can guess how feasible that would be.
<ul><li> <em>Geneforge</em> takes it a step into the broader scope, showing the many ways great power leads to great social insanity, as those who have it, those who want it, and those who rebel against it, all have their own brands of madness. The first games had sympathetic characters from various sects with understandable viewpoints based on their experience, led by crazed and callous demagogues. <em>Geneforge 4</em> inverted this: charismatic and well-intentioned leaders with well-reasoned motivations leading sects filled with desperately crazed individuals justifying atrocities at all levels.

Most obvious is the situation of children born with magical potential. They are taken from their family and locked in a tower under armed guard for what is usually the rest of their life, barring certain exceptional circumstances. When they come of age, they must take a dangerous test with death the penalty for failure—and even afterwards, they always face the looming threat that the fanatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> guards will execute them if they step out of line. The alternative to this brutal treatment of innocents for an accident of birth? The very real possibility, even probability, that they will become possessed by horrors from beyond.
<ul><li> The worst part of it? Most mages turn to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a> only to escape from the Circle. Many may have never become abominations or blood mages if they were not faced with a possibility of lifetime imprisonment, being made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Tranquil</a> or getting killed.
</li><li> To add to that, there exists an example of an alternative, with mages policing themselves. That example being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> where mages lord over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Muggles">muggles</a> and human-sacrifice-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodMagic">Blood Magic</a> is par for the course doesn't inspire anyone's confidence.
</li><li> There's also the Grey Wardens themselves, who undergo an initiation that frequently kills recruits — and even those who survive will die or turn into a monster because of it a couple decades down the line.

From the ancient elves to Tevinter to the Chantry, to the Dwarven undercities and the Qun, there is always someone trying to rule the world through the backs of their slaves/pariahs; the ancient elven 'gods' were actually slave masters who posed as gods and put brainwashing fade tattoos on their property - which means that Dragon Age-era elven culture is a tribal continuation of slave protocols. When they fell, Tevinter took over, and when Andraste broke Tevinter's back, her followers set up a martyrdom around her, turned the cult of the Maker into an official religion, and started oppressing mages everywhere because that was the topic Andraste happened to talk about the most. In all cases, it's easier to kill an archdemon and fight a horde of vicious monsters than to stop eons of oppression, so you're forced to help these oppressive governments no matter what.

The worst part is, he might be right; throughout the series, ten percent of the villains are actually just ordinary humans (Ferris Boyle, Hugo Strange, Simon Stagg) whose actions cause more death and destruction than even Joker, made possible by their flawless integration into society before Batman finally exposes their crimes. Terrorist organizations (Raj Al Ghul), government conspiracies (corrupt police, Amanda Waller), and gangs are Batman's main fight; the supervillains just add a damage multiplier.

<ul><li> And of course, the Enclave (and its nerdy little brother the Institute). They're the logical conclusion of any capitalist empire that goes unchecked: with everyone too distracted by the Cold War to institute proper ethical guidelines and environmental laws, corporations and governments become brutal crucibles that elevate the most ruthless and sadistic into becoming CEOs and Presidents, eventually forming an elitist guild in America that knows how to manipulate and undermine America, but has next to no understanding of empathy or how the world actually works. End result: they push the Communists into a genocidal corner, causing WWIII, teach their descendants to become Neo-Nazis, and turn their one last chance at coming out on top into a sadistic murder-fest of experimental torture that eventually amounted to nothing due to shortsighted political decisions. Even their lackeys admit how utterly insane their higher-ups are.
</li><li> The Institute is slightly better than the Enclave due to its drive to advance scientific progress for humanity, but literally has no overall logistic plan, and as a result, commits genocide against its neighbors by unleashing its failed experiments just to steal critical supplies they could easily trade for. You either have to tear the Institute down and distribute its scientists to various factions, or take leadership and try to steer them in a direction other than straight down.

The prisoners are not necessarily malicious to each other, they are simply locked in a game whose rules (and the lack of mutual trust) dictate backstabbing as the best option for each individual.
</li><li> Money and politics. The realities of a modern democracy make campaign contributions the best way of showing your support for a candidate, but it can be hard to distinguish whether a politician's votes win the support of elites, corporations and lobbyists, or if the elites, corporations and lobbyists' money dictates the politician's votes. And of course the only people who can regulate this system are the ones getting those contributions, and the ones with the most influence over it are the ones giving those contributions.
</li><li> I'll take Political Science and International Relations for five hundred, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jeopardy">Alex.</a>
<ul><li> Classical Realists think that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HobbesWasRight">Hobbes Was Right</a> and people are essentially bastards, so to survive a leader has to be a bigger bastard than your neighbors and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoUntoOthersBeforeTheyDoUntoUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoUntoOthersBeforeTheyDoUntoUs">Do Unto Others Before They Do Unto Us</a>. Neorealists don't blame human nature so much as an anarchic international system where you can't count on any "laws" to save you, but the end result is a similar focus on accumulating power to defend yourself. And thus we get the Security Dilemma, where your efforts to build up power (for defensive purposes, of course) are seen as a threat by your neighbors, who build up power to defend themselves, so you have to build up <em>more</em> power to compensate and then both of you get stuck in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LensmanArmsRace">Lensman Arms Race</a> against each other. Or, maybe you'll find yourself in conflict with a neighbor not because you actually want to risk a fight right now, but because you can't afford to give your potential rival an advantage they could use in a hypothetical future conflict.
</li><li> Liberals and Neoliberals don't necessarily disagree with these core assumptions, but argue that you can try to compensate for the world sucking by fostering democratic norms, economic interdependence and international laws. Yet even if you manage to get a continent to agree to a peaceful, cosmopolitan confederation, all it takes is for one rogue state to start acting aggressive for things to fall apart.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KarlMarx">Marxism</a> claims that human history is defined by the struggle between the working and ruling classes in the contemporary economic system. Each system has its inherent problems; through class struggle such flaws are fixed and a new system emerges <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HereWeGoAgain">with its new set of problems</a>. Proletariat revolution is claimed to solve the conflict between the bourgeoisie and the worker and create a classless utopia aka communism to end the spiral of class struggle for good. However, the command economy of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfTheColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HistoryOfTheColdWar">Communist Bloc</a> during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a> makes these countries unable to win against the Western free market system (which has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InherentInTheSystem">Inherent in the System</a> advantage of competitiveness between producers) in the long run.
</li><li> Constructivism stands out not so much for being a coherent, competing theory, but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Fourth Option</a>. Rather than viewing the challenges of politics and international relations as something inherent to human nature or the way the world works, it posits that it's possible to change things - after all, if people made states and created the international system in which they operate, then surely we can alter the rules if we really want to?
</li></ul></li><li> A lot of the defenders of the system of slavery during the 19th Century used the argument that slave labor was too inherent to the function of the economy, and that getting rid of it would cause a catastrophic collapse of the system. Which, arguably, it did. Although that collapse could have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted">averted</a> or at least mediated more than it was by a gradual phasing into another economic model. Even the abolitionists couldn't come up with a coherent, practical way to get rid of slavery and deal with its aftereffects. For example:
<ul><li> Do you compensate the former slave owners? If so, where does the money come from? If not, you're impoverishing people who had never broken the law.
</li><li> Do you compensate the former slaves? Again, who pays and how much?
</li><li> Where do the newly-freed slaves go? Back to working on the farms? Would cities in the North accept them? What jobs would they be qualified to hold? What about elderly or disabled slaves? Or orphaned children?
</li><li> How about sending them back to Africa? Well, the slaves were probably born in America and had no means or desire to go to a foreign country, and what would they do when they got there?
<ul><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society">American Colonization Society<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was founded with the idea of sending former slaves back to Africa, and even established what would become Liberia. However, out of millions of slaves, they had only managed to settle 13,000 by 1867. The ACS was bitterly resented by freed blacks as they and their families had been in America for generations and had no real connection to Africa. Living conditions were harsh, with tropical diseases and unfriendly locals taking their toll, and furthermore Liberia was not the ancestral origin of most slaves, having been picked because it was the closest available spot. In the true spirit of the trope, the settlers would impose their own slavery on the locals in the generations to come, treating them as second class citizens and holding tightly to power until a coup overthrew the regime in the 1980's.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> made the answer to the first two questions rather tidy: the secessionists were obviously in the wrong, so they deserve no compensation. Instead, they owe reparations which can go to the former slaves <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3lx4v');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3lx4v" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3lx4v');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">At least in theory. In reality, former US slave owners did not pay reparations, and many freed slaves fell victim to backlash violence and systematic discrimination.</span> UK had a more peaceful abolition process which got rid of slavery almost 100 years before US did. Former slave owners were compensated quite handsomely, partially by their former slaves being forced to work as their apprentices after having been freed. Scandinavia underwent a similar process centuries earlier when the Viking Age ended, and the raids stopped.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Buckminster Fuller had a quote relating to breaking free from this, saying that nothing is gained by fighting the system, and that the solution is to create a new system which renders the old one obsolete. Essentially it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">Take a Third Option</a>, or perhaps create new options instead of choosing the existing ones.
</li><li> Studying neuroscience, psychology or sociology will hit you in the head with this (pun intended). The more you know about the processes inside a person's brain, the more you realize that you actually have very few course of actions in any given situation, unless you consciously go against what is wired in your brain. All kinds of bigotry-against nationality, creed, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, any label you can come up with-have their roots in the way a person or a society try to preserve themselves, and it's no justification for atrocities committed to fellow beings. On the other hand, being aware of how those processes work does make it easier to be conscious of when they're at work in your own brain and step back to make an informed decision rather than acting on unconscious impulses.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">Executive Meddling</a>. It's only natural. Want your book or screenplay published? Most people don't have the capital with which to accomplish such. Things like paper to print each page with, actors, props, designers, and what have you cost money. A lot of money. Those with the budget and resources to fund <em>anything</em> still only have so much, so they have to pick and choose what they'll support, based on what they predict will sell the best, and those predictions are often wrong. This gives them the power to insist on modifying something or another, at the threat of pulling out and funding something else instead, and they are well-known to do that anyway. Their drive to make money often prevents them from taking risks and funding something creative instead of more of the same stuff that smashed in the first place. And none of that says anything about any decisions they make for the sake of their egos, a trait inherent in <em>all</em> human beings.
</li><li> The military, of whatever country you choose. As good as some of the individual soldiers who serve in it might be, its still horribly prone to war crimes, sexual abuse, hazing gone wrong, <em>et cetera</em>.
<ul><li> The purpose of a military is to resolve issues pertaining to war, and those who '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyEuphemism">resolve</a>' many battles get promoted to command more people. But since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a>, it inevitably drives some soldiers insane - if they aren't killed first. Those that survive long enough will steadily make their way up the chain of command, but it's a miracle if they haven't gone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">used their connections to get there corruptly but safely</a>. In the end, the ones leading the military are typically the least fit for command, because the initial recruits who could have eventually been worthy of command are in a loony bin, died in combat, or got wise and quit early.
</li><li> The police are the same way; no matter how many good officers there are, unjustified uses of force, abusing authority, and police protecting officers who act in an unprofessional manner ensure that there will always be bad cops.
</li><li> And whenever they get recruits and funding from a very specific community, expect them to be <em>very</em> biased. If they are from a group different from the demographic than where they patrol, it can quickly degrade into stereotyping and an "us versus them" mentality on both sides. Even when it comes to police officers who are of a similar ethnicity or class background to the area, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerOHara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerOHara">Irish immigrants</a> who took on the work in the late nineteenth through mid-twentieth century, they can see themselves as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWhoMadeItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWhoMadeItOut">The One Who Made It Out</a> (and think they're better then the people they serve or that the people they serve are just lazy) while the people they serve view them as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">Category Traitors</a> and little more than dogs on the leash of the ruling class.
</li></ul></li><li> Gender roles. Whatever professions, activities, or whatever are dominated by women are shunned by men, who make a point of keeping women out of their own fields and vice versa. Whenever women filter into a "man's" field, it ceases to become as appealing to men, and ends up becoming "woman's work," often with less prestige and lower pay. And when men perform a "women's" job, they are looked upon as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HouseHusband">un-masculine</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BumblingDad">inherently incompetent</a> at best, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">and as potential predators at worst.</a> Teaching is a great example; when it was a "male" profession, it enjoyed greater respect and pay. When it became a "woman's" profession, the pay and prestige decreased, but any male entering it is viewed with suspicion and accused of just being in it to gain access to kids. Alternately, men going into a "woman's" profession (like computer programming) makes it increase the pay and prestige, but also increase the hours expected to work, decrease the job stability, and women can be made uncomfortable (either by their male co-workers or just feeling alone). What makes this impossible to solve is that the real reason behind these trends have entirely to do with power and egos; each side views what they have as "their" territory and the other gender as interlopers.

</li><li> Pakistan's blasphemy law is a near-impossible issue to deal with. The mere accusation of blasphemy can trigger violence and riots before a trial even starts, and no one person can be completely safe from accusation. Politicians and lawyers have no way of knowing how to reform such an exploitable law without disagreements and/or more riots for questioning the law as it is.
</li><li> Any attempt at using scripture as a basis for law. Many scriptures throughout history have misinterpreted lessons, rewrites from the winners, and plain old errors that were never corrected. This is not the problem; the problem is how inherently <em>stubborn</em> humanity is about simultaneously trying to preserve every line to the letter while constantly re-interpreting the meaning to fit their own self-serving viewpoints; a line endorsing child-incest and/or hate crimes will be plastered over with justification or re-wording rather than fully erased or condoned, contradicting edicts may be horrifyingly merged into something that seems to make sense but blossoms into a logic bomb that blows up into real-life religious terrorism, a few 'minor' edits in the past may be used to justify hateful racism and poor long-term decisions in the future, et cetera. In short, when it comes to scripture, things change, and they change too slowly/haphazardly.
