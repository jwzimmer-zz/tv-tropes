There is nothing wrong with that, and indeed powering and justifying your world with Hard Science is, to many people, preferable to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble">Techno Babble</a>.

</p><p>There's one problem with this approach, however: Science <em>progresses</em>. Around the 1500s, some cultures thought that the sun revolved around the earth. Around the 1900s, there still were scientists who openly questioned the existence of subatomic particles, like electrons and photons. As recently as the start of the millenium, the existence of dark energy, and the corresponding fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating rather than slowing, was not widely known in the scientific community. And many of our current assumptions about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">Life, the Universe, and Everything</a> will inevitably be questioned or disproven in the future. Therefore, when a scientific theory used widely in speculative fiction gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jossed">Jossed</a> by new scientific discoveries, it's because Science Marches On.

For example, the word "atomic" has been mostly supplanted by "nuclear". Likewise, older science fiction written in the US did not foresee the adoption of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMetricSystemIsHereToStay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMetricSystemIsHereToStay">metric measurements</a>.
</p><p>As a result, what seems like bad research in older fiction (in particular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceDoesNotWorkThatWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceDoesNotWorkThatWay">Space Does Not Work That Way</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License  Biology</a>) is actually this: They <em>did</em> do the research; it's just that said research is now outdated. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a> is a subtrope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a> may be considered a sub-trope of this, as the old ideas of "futuristic" look dated now due to new advances in unforeseen directions. For instances where the change is in the historical record, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatedHistory">Dated History</a>; when it's in society itself, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a>.

It's at least conceivable that such a thing could have happened in hindsight, but it would have been so expensive and unrewarding that it seems as absurd as things that have been actively contradicted by new scientific discoveries.

By the time the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PlanetOfTheApes2001">2001 "reimagining"</a> was produced, the idea had been so thoroughly debunked that make-up artist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RickBaker">Rick Baker</a> pressed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimBurton">Tim Burton</a> to change the villainous General Thade from the script's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerGorilla">Killer Gorilla</a> to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManiacMonkeys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManiacMonkeys">chimpanzee</a>.

Studies have since traced the species' likely origin-point to the plains of northern China and Mongolia.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chinatown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Chinatown">Chinatown</a></em>, in which the villain gets away with asserting custody of the girl he'd fathered on his own now-deceased daughter, would have come out <em>very</em> differently after the development of DNA testing, which could easily prove him guilty of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">Parental Incest</a>.
</li><li> An actual plot point in the film version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGeneralsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGeneralsDaughter">The General's Daughter</a></em>. In 1992, the Army leadership covered up a rape of a cadet, as they believed that there was no way to positively identify the rapists, and an unsolvable rape would destroy West Point's reputation. Seven years later, with advances in DNA testing methods, Sunhill convinces one of the rapists to rat out the others. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> No DNA test had actually been done; Sunhill only said that DNA testing could expose the rapists.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackStork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlackStork">The Black Stork</a></em> is a 1917 pro-eugenics movie in which a man's affair with an unclean servant leads to a "blood taint" in his seemingly normal grandson, whose own son is born severely deformed as a result. Needless to say, this is not how genetics works.
</li></ul><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Literature" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Literature">Literature</a></span>
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> wrote a short story titled "Pâté de Foie Gras", which scientifically analyzed the goose that laid the golden eggs, and asked readers to find solutions to the problem that since golden eggs can't hatch, there's no way to get more geese. In a comment years later, Asimov pointed out that advancing science caused there to be a better solution than the one he had originally intended.
<ul><li> For the curious, Asimov's solution was to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> keep the goose in a closed environment until it uses up all the Oxygen-18 in the air (in the story, they found that the goose was converting the O-18 isotope into gold). Without O-18, it can't produce gold, so it will just lay normal eggs</span>. The simpler solution which came later is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> just clone it</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Multiple sci-fi works have used the theory of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_RNA">memory RNA<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to justify one character getting the memories of another. The experiment that supposedly proved the theory has since been discredited.
<ul><li> More than just memories in some cases. In several episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInvisibleMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInvisibleMan">The Invisible Man</a></em> series, the protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">invisibility gland</a> takes over his personality with RNA injected in it. He essentially becomes that person.
</li></ul></li><li> A good portion of the 15th book of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ovid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Ovid">Ovid</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Metamorphoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a></em> has Pythagoras giving a lecture on the fundamental role played by, well, metamorphoses in nature. In a matter of speaking, Ovid has laid the entire epic poem's thesis on this section. Naturally, almost all of Pythagoras' examples, pulled from science of the day, are complete bunk. For example: if you watch a horse's corpse a hornet will (always) come out of it (ostensibly because it turned into one).
</li><li> Robert Heinlein again. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em> the planet Sanctuary has very low radiation level and colonists supposedly risked to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">stay frozen at their present level while the rest of the human race moves on past them</a>", but "it's a bit safer  leukaemia and some types of cancer are almost unknown there". While "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienKudzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienKudzu">more advanced</a>" Terran wheat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienKudzu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienKudzu">beats local weeds</a>. There are problems. First, usual set of bugs with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvolutionaryLevels">Evolutionary Levels</a>. Second, while major radiation poisoning causes particular forms of cancer, there's no compelling reason to tie most cases to the <em>normal</em> radiation background. Third, a result of the previous two: conditions for evolutionary <em>adaptation</em> include gamma rays just like everything else, so modern radiobiology pulled the low end of the scale out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvenLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvenLogic">Oven Logic</a>.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0igxe');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0igxe" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0igxe');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">It's better known for the plants, as their optimums are already orders of magnitude higher, so fallout levels dangerous to humans may still be stimulating to them. For algae, it was known from 1898, the "radiation hormesis" hypothesis appeared in 1981 or so, and at least from 1983 it's about specific numbers <a class="urllink" href="http://www.biomedexperts.com/Abstract.bme/6844555/Possible_effect_of_natural_background_radiation_on_the_development_of_mammals">for mammals<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.</span> E.g. rats grown (not even born) in a low radioactive background have health and development problems, thus <em>some</em> background seems desirable. Sanctuary's choice could boil down to "eat radioactive isotopes or slowly die out". There is some discussion in the book about detonating nuclear weapons on a regular basis to increase the background radiation, but there is a difference between steady but low-level radiation and acute, high levels.
<ul><li> An even more fundamental error: the main driving force behind evolution is competition for survival and for mates, the only needed force is a means for introducing genetic diversity (spontaneous mutation will occur without radiation present), and therefore Sanctuary will not be a stable island of unchanging organisms. All the details of DNA replication were not known in 1959, as its structure had been announced only in 1953.
<ul><li> In <em>Starship Troopers</em> at least these could be in-universe mistakes made by the protagonist, who is narrating the story in the first person. While he's a top-notch <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> and definitely not stupid, he is explicitly stated not to be strong in science (particularly mathematics).
</li><li> In any case, it's now known that a fairly small amount of cross-breeding between two breeding groups that are mostly separate will prevent species divergence. So even granting all that is said in the novel as true, interstellar travel will keep humans on all planets in regular contact with each other the same species.
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Stars!</em>, on the other hand, got it: whether gravity, temperature or radiation on a planet are out of the species' acceptable band to either side, you're in the same amount of trouble.
</li></ul></li><li> A curious example of this comes from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Juvenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Juvenal">Juvenal</a>'s satires, which brought us many still popular phrases and concepts such as '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadAndCircuses">Bread and Circuses</a>' to keep the masses happy, wishing for 'a sound mind in a sound body' or asking '<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen">Who Watches the Watchmen?</a>?'. He also coined the phrase of a 'rare bird in the land' such as 'black swan' meaning to him a nonexistent thing. For many centuries afterwards and in many languages the phrase meant something that did not exist until somebody discovered a black swan in Australia. The phrase changed its meaning and nowadays is used to describe an idea based on a hypotheses that can be disproven by a single counterexample or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutsideContextProblem">are extremely hard to predict or anticipate events that throw everything into chaos</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanDeanFoster">Alan Dean Foster</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">Humanx Commonwealth</a></em> novel <em>Midworld</em>, from 1975, makes ample use of the then-popular notion that a rain forest's ecosystem was sharply divided into "levels", top to bottom. This concept is now downplayed in ecology, as it's turned out that very few species are actually restricted to one "level", and this mode of thinking had ignored numerous other factors of topography and microclimate that can impact a forest's environment just as much. (The 1995 sequel, <em>Mid-Flinx</em>, makes almost no mention of "levels", indicating Foster has Marched On along with the science.)
</li><li> In Edwards Le Comte's autobiographical work <em>In and Out of the University and Adversity</em>, Edward, who had brown eyes, was told in 1934 by someone looking at a color photo of his mother that he must have had a brown-eyed father. When he asked why, the woman said because two people with blue eyes <a class="urllink" href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/aprilholladay/2004-10-14-wonderquest_x.htm">cannot conceive someone with brown eyes<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and that "Biology doesn't lie. People may." She seemed to have noticed his alarm because the next time she saw him, she informed him that he actually had hazel eyes. Nevertheless, in the following years he would from time to time ask people he met what color his eyes were. However, he seems to have come to terms with the question by the time the book was written (in 2001), writing that, "Half my heredity is a blank. At eighty what matter?"
<ul><li> We now know that two people with blue eyes <em>can</em> produce a child with brown eyes, as eye colour is not determined simply by one gene. It's actually quite common for a blue-eyed person to carry a gene for brown eyes that can be passed on to his or her children.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesBlish">James Blish</a>'s novella "Surface Tension," the protagonists are genetically engineered humans the size of large protozoa (one hundredth of an inch), living in a puddle of water. In the introduction setting up the story, we hear one of the genetic engineers say that the people can be so small and still be intelligent because their cells are the size of viruses. When the story was written, we did not realize viruses are not cells.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CherryAmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CherryAmes">Cherry Ames</a>: Cruise Nurse</em>, a little boy shows Cherry his stuffed panda. She pities him, because he had asked for a "teddy bear", and his grandmother had given him a panda, which "isn't even a bear." Since the 1940's, during which the book was written, DNA tests have proven that pandas are in fact bears.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceCaspian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrinceCaspian">Prince Caspian</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CSLewis">C. S. Lewis</a> writes that Reepicheep wanting his tail back was mainly a matter of mouse pride. This book was written in the 1950's- before it was known that mouse tails helped regulate body temperature. Then, with their greater size, talking mice probably had to have their temperature regulation jiggled a bit too.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordPeterWimsey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordPeterWimsey">Lord Peter Wimsey</a></em> story "The Image in the Mirror," a left/right inverted man is experiencing mysterious circumstances. Finding that the man is inverted, Wimsey infers that he must have a opposite (an Evil Opposite) twin who is causing all the mystery and cites experiments with salamander eggs tied off with threads. The experiments were real and important in understanding how the left/right gradient is formed. However, while left/right inverted twins do exist they are vanishingly rare. Most twins are not left/right inverts and most left/right inverts are not twins.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HumanxCommonwealth">The Tar-Aiym Krang</a></em>, Flinx's adoptive parent Mother Mastiff is said to resemble the Terran canine, both in appearance and in her irascible, unfriendly personality. While this may have been the stereotype for the breed back in 1972, when <em>Krang</em> was published, breeders already saw this as a negative trait for mastiffs even then, and most mastiffs today are calm, good-natured, and easy-going animals.
</li><li> In Arthur C. Clarke's 1990 raise-the-<em>Titanic</em> novel <em>The Ghost From The Grand Banks</em>, the Human Genome Project is still ongoing in the second decade of the 21st century. Thanks to breakthroughs in genetic sequencing, it was actually declared to have accomplished its primary task in 2003.
</li><li> In Louisa May Alcott's <em>Little Men</em>, a boy with a severe cough of long duration is given cough syrup, which has honey in it. Then a healthy toddler is allowed to lick the sweet-tasting spoon. Luckily, the older child doesn't have tuberculosis, but he might have had it, and the toddler doesn't catch whatever is actually causing the cough. Of course, the novel was written before the germ theory of disease was generally known.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AfterManAZoologyOfTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AfterManAZoologyOfTheFuture">After Man: A Zoology of the Future</a></em>, contains many instances of this, combining with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust">Zeerust</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. Some of the most egregious examples is that many of the future animals are descended from "insectivores", as in the order "Insectivora", which is now considered a defunct <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastebasket_taxon">wastebasket taxon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of small, generalist, insect-eating mammals that aren't particularly closely related in reality, and the false notion that bats are poor-sighted and will eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillNotHaveAppendixesInTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillNotHaveAppendixesInTheFuture">lose their eyes entirely</a>, but really, bats have pretty good vision, and no species is blind.
</li><li> In Lawrence Block's Evan Tanner series the "sleep center" of the narrator's brain was destroyed by shrapnel during the Korean War. As a consequence, he never sleeps <em>at all</em>, leaving an enormous amount of spare time for him to do things like learning multiple languages. Even if you ignore symptoms such as depression and hallucinations, the eventual effect of chronic long-term sleep deprivation is <em>death</em>.
<ul><li> Also, the brain's capacity for sleep is widely distributed among multiple regions, so there's no <em>one</em> "sleep center" to it; the closest thing to a sleep-<em>modulating</em> center, the reticular formation, would tend to leave a person <strong>permanently</strong> asleep if disabled. Or just plain dead from their injury, given its location deep within the life-function-maintaining brain stem.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TailchasersSong">Tailchaser's Song</a></em> came out in the 1980s, domestic cats were seen as solitary animals who only sometimes live in clowders. This is why it gets repeatedly mentioned that it's uncomfortable and unnatural for cats to be in large groups for long periods of time. Since then, research has shown that cats are more social than previously thought.
</li><li> <em>Inu Monogatari</em> is a 1901 Japanese book that insists native Japanese dog breeds are descended from dholes. This is inaccurate. The dogs are descended from wolves, just like all domestic dogs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Felidae" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Felidae">Felidae</a></em>, "European Shorthair" is used as a synonym for "Domestic Shorthair". In the 1980s, this was commonplace. However, since then, "European Shorthair" has become known exclusively as a breed, while "Domestic Shorthair" is a fancy term for "mixed-breed/moggy cat".

Realistic enough. However, their jaws are depicted as permanently protruding, an out-of-date assumption as we have learned more about goblin shark physiology.
</li><li> <em>Bio Inc: Redemption</em> has "Moderate Drinking" as a positive lifestyle choice, citing the common belief that light drinking can actually have health benefits. While this does technically hold true, not even a year after the game left Early Access, some studies claimed that the benefits are outweighed by the risks and that there really isn't a "safe" amount of drinking one can do.

In 2013, it was discovered that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/male-lions-do-help-hunting-after-all-f6C10149668">male lions do hunt, but differently<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. And of course long before this study it had been known that male lions do at times assist on group hunts, especially when their extra bulk is helpful in finishing off large prey that the lionesses have restrained.

</p><ul><li> Any discussion of "pack dynamics" in wolves (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JulieOfTheWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JulieOfTheWolves">Julie of the Wolves</a></em> comes to mind.) Modern research has shown that wolf packs are more or less nuclear families, with the "alpha" male and female simply being the parents of the rest of the pack. They still let strangers in, but it's mostly based on one family. The original study that created the idea was done with captive wolves, who take on more of a prison-style hierarchy. Even the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._David_Mech">researcher who popularized the idea<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> has long since <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(ethology)#Controversy">rejected it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the face of better research.
</li><li> Speaking of wolves, the notion of canines only seeing in black and white or having worse vision compared to humans. In actuality, while humans have three color-sensitive cone cells (red, green, and blue) dogs only have two (yellow and blue). They very much can see colors, but just can't distinguish between green, yellow, and red objects based on color alone. They <em>can</em>, however, distinguish between them based on perceived brightness as they have more rod cells and more easily distinguish between grays. It's more accurate to say dogs see <em>differently</em> than humans: humans see better in daylight thanks to our superior cone cells while dogs see better in the dark and at dusk due to their superior rod cells, allowing the two to team up and vastly increase the times and effectiveness of hunting.
</li><li> Any depiction of dolphins or other whales mating for life. A nice romantic notion in its day, but it turns out they're promiscuous breeders at best and into sexual harassment or <em>gang rape</em> at worst.
</li><li> A lot of older works (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">and some today</a>) will often make it a philosophical point about how animals only kill each other for food, or that abuse and cruelty are human inventions. However sadism and abuse have in fact been documented in numerous species and it is thought to be the norm in others. Plenty of predators have been observed to kill out of boredom and even herbivores will injure and kill one other of territories and mates.
</li><li> The dynamics of various animal groups are far too complex to go into here, but suffice to say that none of them fit the antiquated view of herds as roughly mirroring human social groups, with an alpha male leader who calls all the shots. In many polygynous species the "alpha male" is (in effect) nothing more than a walking sperm bank.
</li><li> For the longest time, people believed snakes to be deaf since they had no external ears and seldom appear to react to airborne sounds. It's now been shown that snakes <em>can</em> hear to an extent (to what extent is unknown) by picking up vibrations from the air or ground through their bodies and processing them through the inner-ear. In fact, loud noises can actually cause stress to snakes.
</li><li> Taxonomy runs into a lot of problems with this trope. Due to a complicated hierarchy and scientific species names based on species' places in the hierarchy (i.e. the binomial nomenclature of <em>Genus species</em>), every time new information on evolutionary lineage is discovered, binomial names or the bigger groupings higher up in the ranking may have to change and go obsolete (see the <em>Brontosaurus</em> example in Paleontology and Anthropology's section below for the exception to this rule). It's confusing enough to change the old lineages, but that's the way of science—but changing the <em>names of species</em> is simply confusing. There is currently a campaign attempting to abolish the binomial system and give each species an unchanging monomial name.
<ul><li> This problem largely arose with introduction of genetic studies; before that, taxonomy was largely based on morphology. Modern molecular biology has shown that many taxa previously thought to be monophyletic (that is, sharing a common ancestor that's not also the ancestor of anything outside that taxon) are actually just examples of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution">convergent evolution<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Reevaluations of the old morphological data in light of this will often reveal new characters that support the new topology as well.
</li><li> Genetic studies also introduced problems in that not all taxa are equal. Let's take the most well-known examplethe different classes of vertebrates (Kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata), such as Mammalia, Reptilia, Aves (birds), and Amphibia. The problem here is that they didn't diverge at the same time, and so these groups are not a dependable way to distinguish amount of genetic difference, i.e. what <em>actually</em> differentiates species. The common ancestral species of amphibians diverged from the common mammal-reptile ancestor before mammals and reptiles diverged from each other, and birds are technically a subset of reptiles according to genetics and morphology, only considered different due to superficial differences. Therefore, if the proper way to denote an amphibian is Animalia Chordata Amphibia etc. etc., the proper way to denote a bird while still maintaining accuracy would be Animalia Chordata Reptilia-Mammalia Reptilia Aves. That's a mess, and we're only up to the class! Likewise, within mammals, the common ancestor of monotremes (such as platypi) diverged from the placental-marsupial common ancestor before placentals (e.g. humans, dogs) and marsupials (e.g. kangaroos) diverged from each other, making them not on the same level. For these reasons, classical taxonomy is beginning to be abandoned.
<ul><li> Reptilia-Mammalia is commonly known as Amniota. And there's several (about 7-8 at current thinking) levels both between then and Chordata, and them and Aves, a quite complex link in that case, which sees turtles splitting off from birds, lizards and crocodiles, and then lizards splitting off, and finally crocodiles and birds parting ways, with birds continuing down through dinosaurs.
</li><li> With the discoveries of more and more feathered dinosaurs (and the latest research a high probability that <em>most</em> dinosaurs likely had feathers, just as most mammals have hair)<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note173yw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note173yw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note173yw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The dinosaurs that evidence shows (through skin impressions) probably didn't have some kind of feathers are descended from ancestors that did, similar to the way mostly hairless cetaceans evolved from furry ancestors</span>, and are, some people are questioning whether birds should be considered a different class from dinosaurs at all. Some researchers even speak of the K-T extinction as only having wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs. Others suggest "dinosaurs" should be reclassified as birds.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> One of the unspoken justifications for early "Lost World" fiction was the tacit belief that God wouldn't <em>really</em> allow any of His creations to be killed off entirely, so there must be some hidden region where organisms that had vanished from the landscape were still around. Only as more and more species were wiped off the map by humans and an ever-growing variety of fossils were discovered did the idea that extinction was a real phenomenon take hold, relegating the notion of such isolated refugia to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpeculativeFiction">Speculative Fiction</a>.
</li><li> One of the most commonly repeated factoids about reptiles is that they grow throughout their lives. However, actual evidence for this is rather lacking and open to interpretation. There is substantial evidence that how big a reptile gets depends a lot more on their individual genetics and food supply than it does on how long they manage to live, and even if/when it is true that they keep growing, growth becomes so slow past a certain point in the reptile's life that its almost inconsequential.
</li><li> Hyenas have fallen under this several times in history. They were once thought to be hermaphrodites that regularly switched between being male and female because of the female's infamous "pseudopenis" and larger size. This was eventually understood to be wrong, but the idea of them being stupid scavengers still persists despite research eventually proving this wrong. They are the smartest social carnivore (smart enough to solve some kinds of puzzles more quickly than primates), and they hunt most of what they eat. Incidentally, lions, being larger and more powerful, steal food from them more than the other way around, and comparatively scavenge more in general whenever they are given the opportunity.

</p><ul><li> In an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells">H.G. Wells</a> novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstMenInTheMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFirstMenInTheMoon">The First Men in the Moon</a></em>, gravity is said to travel as waves that can be blocked by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlebotinum">phlebotinum</a> alloy of metals and helium called cavorite. This is how they get to the moon.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulesVerne">Jules Verne</a> complained about the gravity blocking metal, calling Wells a hack for not taking science seriously enough. On the other hand, there is a book from as late as the 70's calling Wells' conception of time as a fourth dimension ridiculous, and, though Wells himself couldn't have known it at the time, relativity and quantum physics have since given credence to the idea of gravity waves and a graviton particle. We still haven't found any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Minded</a> alien insects on the moon, or gravity-repelling metal alloy, though.
<ul><li> Also, Verne had to hand-wave away a basic problem with the physics of <em>his</em> moon-shot launching system (the acceleration required to reach escape velocity within the length of a gun barrel would reduce the passengers to chunky salsa). Although it seems that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">this was due to Hetzel, Verne's publisher</a>, who thought a self propelled rocket wasn't believable (or maybe cool) enough to the audience. Hence the problem which had to be explained away.
</li></ul></li><li> The basic physical considerations (like energy conservation law) suggest that all the energy obtained from canceling gravity must somehow be introduced into the system in some other way  most probably, during the manufacture of the very gravity-canceling material, which would make it hideously impractical, if not outright impossible, in the first place.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BuckRogers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/BuckRogers">Buck Rogers</a></em> novelette had a form of antimatter called "inertron" that flew towards the nearest vacuum rather than explode.

Despite this, the research is <em>very</em> secretive, and the discovery is made before Einsteinium, the element that actually goes into that spot. Shortly before the discovery of Einsteinium is made public, the research into E99 is shut down and completely buried, so the rest of the scientific world has Einsteinium as 99 in their periodic tables.

<div class="indent">"Well," I said thoughtfully, "we learnt that the creepy necklace is Astatine's way of communicating with the wizard, that she's meant to hand Legolas over to the wizard, that Aragorn was able to tell Legolas his own name, and what?"

</div><ul><li> At the time the mission was written, Astatine <em>was</em> the heaviest of the halogens. In <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTeens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewTeens">The New Teens</a>, Tennessine took that title.

</p><ul><li> Not SF, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">Older Than Radio</a>: Dr Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of Independence and surgeon general of the Continental Army, was also a temperance activist. In 1784, he published <em>An Inquiry into the Effects of Spirituous Liquors upon the Human Body, and Their Influence upon the Happiness of Society</em>, describing the negative physical and social effects of distilled liquor such as rum and whiskey ... but <em>fermented</em> drinks like beer were <em>good</em>, because they didn't have the same type of alcohol as distilled drinks. (To be fair, Rush couldn't exactly do a chemical analysis to see that ethanol is ethanol. He was having to go off the way people acted after a few mugs.)
<ul><li> The same idea was expressed decades earlier by William Hogarth in two prints. The better-known one (and likely Hogarth's best-known work) is <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/GinLane.jpg">"Gin Lane"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, and shows the very real horrors brought to London by the trade in cheap gin. The lesser-known print, <a class="urllink" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Beer_Street_-_Calle_de_la_cerveza.jpg">"Beer Street"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>, shows the benefits of good English ale. This being Hogarth, nothing is quite as clear-cut as it seems; some critics believe that aspects of the prints point to Hogarth blaming the despair and poverty seen in Gin Lane on the smug and self-satisfied inhabitants of Beer Street.
</li></ul></li><li> Look no further than old chemistry texts for good examples of this. <em>General Chemistry</em> by the great Linus Pauling and a former standard first-year text has element 104 on its periodic table as kurchatovium; you might perhaps know it as rutherfordium. (A number of transfermic elements suffered from dueling names for decades during the Cold War; for instance, element 105, now called dubnium, was referred to as "hahnium" and "nielsbohrnium" by American and Soviet chemists respectively, and many periodic tables simply called it "unnilpentium" until a consensus was achieved.) For fundamental particles, it makes reference to there being eight each baryons and antibaryons (there are considerably more), eight mesons and antimesons (again, more), eight leptons and antileptons (there are twelve, six each), and lists the graviton, which is entirely theoretical. In many other respects, however, it's entirely accurate to a modern understanding.
</li><li> In 1926, chemist Andreas von Antropoff proposed an Element 0, which he called Neutronium, and placed this at the top of the Periodic Table (this was six years before the neutron was discovered). This was eventually dismissed. Turns out a form of neutronium DOES exist—specifically, degenerate neutronium in the cores of neutron stars. It isn't an element, though.

<ul><li> The film <em>Crack in the World</em>, whose creators prided themselves on scientific accuracy, had the extreme misfortune to be released in 1964, very shortly before the phenomenon of tectonic plates was confirmed. This instantly made the film's premise of the Earth having a completely solid crust which is endangered when it develops a crack quite laughable.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TotalRecall1990">Total Recall (1990)</a></em>.

The latest research and pictures taken from satellites have proven that there actually is ice right under the surface in some areas of Mars. On the other hand, there is still a pretty huge difference between "ice right under the surface of some areas" and "ice core".
</li><li> Prior to the acceptance of plate tectonics, an elaborate series of prehistoric land bridges were posited to explain how similar species had ended up being separated by oceans. In Disney's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SwissFamilyRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SwissFamilyRobinson">Swiss Family Robinson</a></em>, released in 1960, this land bridge theory is cited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> the movie's use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">Misplaced Wildlife</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwissFamilyRobinson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSwissFamilyRobinson">the original novel</a> also features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife">Misplaced Wildlife</a>, but offers no explanation for it).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMolePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMolePeople">The Mole People</a></em> the characters reference the existence of a "Flood Layer", referring to the theory by Biblical geologists that there exists a geological layer formed as a result of the world-wide flood from Noah's story.

Subsequent scientific marching has proved the story mostly right on this point. But he got it wrong when he wrote about continents rising and sinking from the ocean. He also wrote that the Pacific ocean had been created when the moon was separated from Earth, and that parts of the Antarctic had remained unchanged for almost 4 billion years. <br/><br/>That said, even rising and sinking landmasses aren't implausible: Though entire plates don't tend to rise and fall, there's evidence of significant landmasses sinking over time (e.g. <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealandia">Zealandia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>), and Antarctica's geology is still a mystery box (while there are parts of North America and Australia which <em>are</em> at least over <em>three</em> billion years old, with some older rock samples mixed in) so the idea of there being deeply ancient chunks of Antarctica isn't <em>that</em> far-fetched.

<ul><li> Though what he depicts is <em>still</em> false, of course, it wasn't as unlikely as it seems. Verne only used the title "Journey to the <em>center</em> of Earth" because his editor thought it would sell well. He did make enough research to understand that the <em>literal</em> center of the Earth would be uninhabitable due to pressure and heat. In Verne's vision, his underground world is nothing more than a very, very, very vast cave, deep underground, and nobody quite knows what's <em>under</em> the ground of that underground world.

Five years later it actually was proven.
<ul><li> This was referenced in some dialog from an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a>,</em> probably to address the earlier gaffe.
</li><li> Fermat's Last Theorem was indeed proven in 1995but it was done using advanced mathematical techniques invented in the 19th and 20th centuries of which Fermat could not have known. Fermat's original "truly marvelous" proof remains a mysterythough there is reason to believe that if he had indeed discovered a simple proof, he later realised that it was flawed, abandoned work on it when the flaws proved irreparable, and then disposed of the workings some time before he died.
</li><li> The same is true in an even earlier Russian children's book series about a teen-sized android named Elektronik. A young math whiz in class proves Fermat's Last Theorem for 600 different cases over the summer break and presents it to his teacher. His 8th grade teacher is skeptical but agrees it looks promising. The notebook with the proof is then put near a flashlight supposedly run by a perpetual motion device and forgotten. The boy who wrote the proof later takes the notebook and destroys it.

While it was once believed that goat milk could safely be consumed by those allergic to cow milk due to its lack of alpha-s1 casein, this has since been debunked since goat milk contains other milk allergens, i.e. beta-lactoglobulin and immunoglobulin-E, which would trigger cross-reactivity in people allergic to cow milk.

</li><li> Invoked in "The Red/White Blues". Everyone was supposed to take chloroquine to prevent malaria. By mistake, primaquine was sent instead, but this causes anemia in black people. When Klinger and another Caucasian (Corp. Goldman, who is Jewish) suddenly got strange symptoms, they were found to be anemic; the doctors eliminated all but the medicine. Klinger and Goldman were fine once they stopped taking it. The credits mentioned the medicine was later found to also negatively affect those of Mediterranean descent.

On the other hand, some <em>actual</em> parasites now appear to have beneficial side effects on their human hosts, such as the suppression of autoimmune diseases and exclusion of other, more harmful parasites via competition. For example, leeches are sometimes used for modern day bloodletting in reattached limbs because they naturally produce a substance that prevents clotting, which keeps the blood flowing to the limb.

It should also be noted, for those too young to remember, that back in the 80s, homosexuals were seen to be the origin, or more often the sole victims, of AIDS.

</p><ul><li> It was once believed that the third finger of one's hand contained a vein that led directly back to the heart. Thus, wearing a wedding ring on that finger originally symbolized the joining of the married couple's hearts. While it's technically true that the vein in the ring finger goes to your heart, so does every other vein; in fact, <em>all</em> veins go to the heart, either directly or (for portal veins) by way of the liver or pituitary gland. Going to the heart is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">what veins do.</a>
</li><li> Associating the heart, an organ that propels blood, with the capacity for love is an even older example. Ancient peoples noticed that its beat sped up when someone's emotions were aroused, not realizing this was a secondary effect of feelings arising in the brain.
</li><li> The big one is bloodletting, which is perhaps the oldest medical practice in the world.
<ul><li> It was in use for literally thousands of years, dating back as far as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientEgypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AncientGreece">Ancient Greece</a>, and all that time it was considered an awesome way to treat basically everything. In comparison, bloodletting has only widely been considered quackery for about a hundred and fifty years. Why did the practice continue for so long? Well, patients thought it worked due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect">Placebo Effect</a>. Plus, doctors thought they ought to be doing <em>something</em> and they had no idea what actually caused disease. More than anything else, it was the discovery of germs which brought an end to bloodletting.
</li><li> Bloodletting <em>does</em> work in certain specific circumstancessuch as the relief of laminitis in horses (who of course are not susceptible to placebo effects). One of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHerriot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesHerriot">James Herriot</a>'s books describes his horse-expert boss doing it to a pony suffering from severe acute laminitis, to the astonished horror of both Herriot himself and the Roma who owned the pony. It worked.
</li><li> Blood-letting is also a useful treatment for compartment syndrome and for re-attachment of severed body parts, in both cases because deoxygenated blood that's trapped inside a crushed or newly-reattached appendage can accumulate so much pressure that no new oxygen-rich blood can enter to keep its tissues alive. It is also used to treat hemochromatosis (iron overload), these patients are very reliable blood donors.
</li><li> Bloodletting (technically a much more modern form called phlebotomy) is still used today for a very specific condition called hemachromatosis (basically, an excess of iron in the blood and excess red blood cells). It's not very common and generally only comes up during blood transfusions. This condition would not have been known when bloodletting was a common practice, though.
</li></ul></li><li> Another idea discredited by germ theory was that of the "four humors", which was developed in Ancient Greece and lasted over two thousand years. Humorism held that illness was caused by imbalances in the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) and health could be restored by restoring that balance. This is tied into the prevalence of bloodletting, as this theory held excessive blood to be one of four possible causes for disease. Some modern English words come from the "four humors" theory. For example, excessive blood was believed to lead to excessive cheerfulness, which is why "sanguine" means both "bloody" and "cheerful". Similarly, black bile was believed to be the cause of depression, hence the word "melancholy" literally means "black bile". There are also numerous references to the four humors in the works of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WilliamShakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>.
</li><li> In the mid-19th century, the prevailing theory of disease was miasma theory, which blamed disease on bad air and smells. It is from miasma theory that we get our word "malaria", meaning "bad air". Although the theory was wrong, its focus on sanitation improved the treatment of disease from what it had been like previously. For example, Florence Nightingale's work at improving sanitary conditions in hospitals was based on miasma theory. Then again, while miasma theory was wrong about bad smells being the cause of disease...the organisms that actually were responsible for disease were also responsible for the bad smells. So by coming up with traps and modern plumbing to keep sewer air out of houses, they were actually preventing disease, just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons">not for the reasons they thought</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummationCounterfeit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConsummationCounterfeit">The idea of the hymen as a reliable indicator for virginity/lack thereof</a>, akin to the "freshness seal" on many foodstuffs. It is now known that it can break or tear in ways <em>completely</em> unrelated to sex (horseback riding, for example), and some women are born without one. It's also now known that most women have a hole (or even multiple holes) in it, and some women can have an intact hymen even if they've been sexually active for <em>decades</em>, or even given birth before. The majority of women <em>do not</em> bleed the first time they have penetrative sex. (There <em>are</em> some women who do have the "Hollywood hymen" that completely covers the vaginal opening, but that is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperforate_hymen">a medical condition<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, not the average woman's default state.) Therefore, it is <em>not</em> a reliable indicator for virginity (or lack thereof.) In fact, all the hymen actually is is <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymen">a vestigial remnant of the Mullerian ducts that formed the reproductive tract during fetal development.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The practice of <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trepanning">trepanning<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which consisted of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeatgrinderSurgery">boring a hole in the skull</a>, with the idea that doing so would cure headaches, seizures, head injuries, and mental disorders. It was widely practiced in antiquity, but has (with only a very few exceptions) fallen out of practice today. Ironically, trepanning <em>could</em> save lives when administered to victims of recent head wounds, by alleviating pressure from cerebral edema or intracranial bleeding. But applying the same technique to uninjured mental patients was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">When All You Have Is a Hammer...</a> applied when a hammer (and chisel) was actually the <em>worst</em> option.
<ul><li> Along with bloodletting, trepanning is among one of the oldest procedures developed, to the point where prehistoric human remains have been found showing evidence of undergoing (and recovering from) this procedure. Whereas the conditions that bloodletting WOULD be effective at treating likely weren't understood, head wounds are a much easier concept for ancient people to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">wrap their heads around</a>, and thus may have been used for medical purposes, in addition to speculated ritualistic reasons possibly explaining prehistoric examples of skulls with holes in them (and evidence of bone healing indicating survival).
</li></ul></li><li> The concept of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HystericalWoman">"hysteria,"</a> which was that the uterus would (somehow) escape from its normal place in the lower abdomen and pummel other organs, like a pinball game, causing all sorts of physical and mental problems. This alleged problem stemmed from (depending on whom you asked) the patient either not having enough sex (or not having enough <em>good</em> sex), or having too much of it, or not conforming to traditional ideas of femininity...and thus legitimate (sometimes life-threatening) diseases were dismissed as "hysteria," or "it's all in her head." Thankfully, "hysteria" is no longer a valid medical or psychiatric diagnosis.
</li><li> Historical "medicines" were often at best ineffective and at worst deadlier than the disease they were meant to treat. Plants and substances that triggered some reaction from the body (rashes, coughing, itchiness, etc) were widely used to treat aliments as the body's reaction to the substance indicated it was doing "something." Harmful medicines included mercury, which was the most common "cure" for syphilis even though it probably killed the patients faster than the disease.

<ul><li> The film not only featured inaccurately-drawn dinosaurs, but at the very beginning of the "Rite of Spring" segment, the Earth is seen being formed from material thrown out from the Sun, the Sun itself being made of fire instead of hot gas, and at the end, the dinosaurs go extinct as a result of a global drought caused by climate change rather than by a meteorite impact.
</li><li> Interestingly enough, the film <em>was</em> originally going to have an accurate (for the time) <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em>. Paleontologists hired as consultants for the film insisted that the <em>T. rex</em> be portrayed with only two fingers. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney">Walt Disney</a> stated that the <em>T. rex</em> should have three fingers in the film because he believed that audiences wouldn't be able to recognize it otherwise. Amusingly, this makes it a reasonably accurate <em>Allosaurus</em>, which actually existed at the same time as Stegosaurus, so the two mistakes cancelled to make it an accurate depiction.

<ul><li> Whilst it was considered rather dubious that dromaeosaurids were scaly at the time of the first film, it wasn't really confirmed, with the first feathered dinosaur fossil being discovered three years after the first film's release.
</li><li> The velociraptors are an unusual case - their size and much of their appearance is unlike the real-life animal because Michael Crichton based a lot of his research on the work of one specific palaeontologist who was suggesting Deinonychus was a species of Velociraptor. The paleontologist in question has since recanted this.
</li></ul></li><li> The raptors also strangely invert this - despite Alan Grant's infamous "six-foot turkey" monologue, the raptors rarely use their sickle claws to slash at prey, instead preferring to use their teeth and arm claws. Recent studies have suggested that the sickle claws on the toes were not actually used for slashing - they evolved as climbing tools in early, arboreal dromaeosauroids, and later became used as pitons to hold on to struggling prey, much like modern birds of prey.

However, this is also inverted in two cases - firstly, the depiction of Spinosaurus as bigger than T-rex was actually correct (indeed, Jurassic Park III's version is actually <em>smaller</em> than the real animal, although it is taller) and, secondly, the Spinosaurus is depicted as a competent swimmer, with recent studies showing that <em>Spinosaurus</em> was indeed semi-aquatic.

</li><li> The horrors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> made many anthropologists of the 50s drop the idea that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">Humans Are Special</a>, intelligent, tool-maker conquerors of Nature and switch to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">Humans Are Bastards</a> instead, the only primate that is a carnivorous, egotistical, weapon-making killer beast that loves violence and is doomed to destroy itself. The influence of this idea can be noted in Pierre Boulle's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PlanetOfTheApes">La Planete des Singes</a></em>, which would later inspire the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PlanetOfTheApes">Planet of the Apes</a></em> movies, as apes were then regarded as what "we" should have been before becoming homicidal beasts: peaceful leaf-eaters sitting in the rainforest, and that once we've wiped us out ourselves they'd build a real harmonious civilization. However, when primatologists actually began to study ape communities in the wild in the 1960s they found that apes (especially chimpanzees) weren't that peaceful in reality and actually had their share of hunting, fights for supremacy, stealing, rape, infanticide, war and cannibalism. As <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall">Jane Goodall<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> once declared (paraphrasing): "I came thinking that apes were better than us, and I discovered that they were just the same".
<ul><li> Ironically, bonobos, currently the species widely considered to contain the most intelligent nonhuman individual (a bonobo called Kanzi), actually <em>are</em> considerably more peaceful in their intraspecific interactions than Humans and most other apes.

</p><ul><li> The case of the Brontosaurus:
<ul><li> In 1879, paleontologist Othniel Marsh misidentified an <em>Apatosaurus</em> (deceptive lizard) skeleton as a new genus, which he named <em>"Brontosaurus"</em> (thunder lizard). The error was pointed out in <em>1903</em>, but the newer name proved more persistent in pop culture; even when the more proper term is discussed, it's often related as if Science only recently Marched On (e.g. this <a class="urllink" href="http://www.sheldoncomics.com/archive/070815.html">''Sheldon'' strip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). There is a loophole in the form of a grandfather clause: "The prevailing usage must be maintained" when "the senior synonym or homonym has not been used as a valid name after 1899" and "the junior synonym or homonym has been used for a particular taxon, as its presumed valid name, in at least 25 works, published by at least 10 authors in the immediately preceding 50 years". Looks like "Brontosaurus" missed by only a few years, but thank goodness <em>Tyrannosaurus rex</em> slipped in, otherwise we would be calling him "Manospondylus gigas".
</li><li> The <em>Brontosauri</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KingKong2005">King Kong (2005)</a></em> were consciously called <em>Brontosaurus</em> as a homage to the old use of the name and (in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">associated in-story material</a>) because the name was recycled for the newly discovered creatures.
</li><li> The <em>Brontosaurus</em> was also provided with an incorrect skulla <em>Camarasaurus</em> skull that Marsh incorrectly figured would be close enough to what its real skull probably looked likebut, contrary to popular belief, this problem is entirely unrelated to its being renamed. It wasn't even definitively proven until 1970 that the skull was incorrect.
</li><li> In another twist, it's believed <em>"Brontosaurus"</em> may still have hope for revival after all, especially after being a valid genus again since 2015; if <em>Supersaurus</em> is indeed found to be simply a <em>Apatosaurus</em> species, <em>A.excelsus</em> would end up as a different animal to <em>A.ajax</em>, <em>A.louisae</em> and <em>Supersaurus</em>. Currently scientific opinion is somewhat divided on the matter, but Tschopp et al. (2015) found that several mostly temporally earlier species, including one that had previously been split from <em>Apatosaurus</em>, had significant differences in vertebral structure from the <em>Apatasaurus ajax</em> holotype.
</li></ul></li><li> In the late 19th century, a sculptor named Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins built massive statues of what the current science thought dinosaurs looked like, as they had only been recently discovered and rarely in complete skeletons, most of which run contrary to modern science's view. His most famous mistake was the <em>Iguanodon</em> that walked on all fours and whose thumb was placed on its nose. These sculptures still exist, and can be seen in <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_Dinosaurs">Crystal Palace Park, London, UK<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> More precisely, the sculptures represented the theories of paleontologist Richard Owen, who in fact coined the name "Dinosauria". Other scientists like Gideon Mantell thought that <em>Iguanodon</em> could have, from time to time, stood on its hind legs. However even he imagined the animal as a gargantuan iguana with a nose-horn, and he sadly didn't live to see the discovery of several well-preserved <em>Iguanodon</em> fossils a couple of decades later, which drastically revised science's ideas about the animal and consequentially caused a drop in the Crystal Palace dinos' popularity.
</li><li> After finding complete skeletons, <em>Iguanodon</em> reconstructions for a long time also suffered from the "kangaroo stance"-fallacy. Later it turned out that they were indeed at least capable of walking on all fours. The latest reconstructions are nevertheless still a far cry from Hawkins' rhino-lizards.
</li><li> One of the greatest differences between old and modern models is that up to a point in time, it was believed that the legs of quadruped dinosaurs were bound exactly like crocodiles' (since they're also reptiles, right?). This is also linked to the "kangaroo stance" theropods mentioned above.
</li><li> And the long-held view that dinosaurs dragged their tails along the ground. It wasn't until the late 80's that this began to change, considering the structure of the hips and tails wouldn't have allowed it. Also the "swan neck" many sauropods were depicted in (with the exception of the Brachiosaurs, sauropods couldn't lift their necks more than 30 degrees above the horizontal). And there's now paleontologists arguing that the thinking on sauropod necks went too much the other way: that many were actually flexible enough to make an S-bend, and probably were held in that position normally.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennewick_Man">Kennewick man<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> ("the one that looks like Patrick Stewart"). Nobody actually believes in "race" per se anymore, and American Indians were only considered "mongoloid" for phylogenetic, rather than anatomical, reasons. Finally, even <em>creationists</em> acknowledge variation within a species. Despite this, these errors were deliberately made "in the interest of science" during the Kennewick man debacle. That the media repeatedly misstated that until then human habitation in the Americas only went back some 8000 years, when it had been known since the 1920s that humans had been in the Americas for at least some 12000 years, only made it worse.
</li><li> As more and more studies are made about the bone structure of dinosaurs, how their bones connected and just how flexible the joints were, the smaller details of the way we perceive how the animals might have looked and behaved changes so fast, media and the public have a tough time keeping up. One of the more "radical" findings that frequently gets overlooked when it comes to depicting dinosaurs is the revelation that most dinosaurs couldn't rotate their hands the way humans can, and that their palms were almost permanently stuck facing inward. Thus the classic (and to most people, standard) way of positioning their hands the kangaroo-way became as obsolete and incorrect as the kangaroo-stance itself. But it's such a relatively insignificant detail that most pictures/movies/sculptures/toys still get it wrong.
</li><li> It was formerly believed that feathers originated in the theropod lineage at some point during the Jurassic period, with small, arboreal theropods such as <em>archeopteryx</em> evolving them for flight. However, molecular evidence has shown that the origin of feathers go even further back than that. A paper published in 2006 confirmed that alligators possess the same gene for growing feathers that birds do, which would punt the origin for feathers back to the common ancestor of birds and crocodilians, sometime back in the Triassic period. Indeed, it would appear that bird feathers, dinosaur protofeathers and pterosaur pycnofibres are all variations on the same basal archosaur fuzz, which evolved as a form of insulation rather than for flight. Note that pennaceous (ie: bird-like) feathers have been pushed back farther in the line of feather evolution; the so-called "protofeathers" are actually just crushed pennaceous feathers; thus animals like <em>Velociraptor</em> (which has quill knobs, a dead giveaway of pennaceous feathering) or <em>Yutyrannus</em> (with its feather imprints on the fossil slab it was preserved in) sport pennaceous feathers. Another feathered theropod, <em>Sciurumimus</em>, is an <em>incredibly</em> basal coelurosaur; it was only <em>slightly</em> more advanced than the megalosauroids (and was even jumping between being a coelurosaur or megalosauroid for a while).
</li><li> <em>Edmontosaurus</em> actually had a <a class="urllink" href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/12/12/surpise-well-studied-dinosaur-actually-had-a-cocks-comb/">crest after all<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em>Basilosaurus</em> was originally thought to be a marine reptile, and its bones were arranged like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeaMonster">sea serpent</a>. It was later discovered that <em>Basilosaurus</em> was not a reptile at all, but an early <em>whale.</em>
</li><li> The mysterious <em>Tullimonstrum</em> of Carboniferous Illinois was infamous for over 50 years, due to its extremely strange characteristics that confused many a paleontologist. The only conclusion that anyone could even reach was that it was an invertebrate, and thus many (now-outdated) paleoart depicts it as a strange <a class="urllink" href="https://www.isgs.illinois.edu/sites/isgs/files/images/outreach-images/tully.gif">annelid-slug-arthropod-cuttlefish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> conglomeration. As of 2016, a study proves that it was none of those, and wasn't even an invertebrate. It in fact was a vertebrate that was closely related to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampreyMouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampreyMouth">lamprey</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> One thing that's <em>not</em> covered by science marching on is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMillionBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneMillionBC">the depiction of cavemen living alongside dinosaurs</a>. At no point in the history of paleontology did actual scientists believe this. The first scientific paper on dinosaurs, Gideon Mantell's "The Geological Age of Reptiles" in 1831, said in its first sentence, "Among the numerous interesting facts which the researches of modern geologists have brought to light, there is none more extraordinary and imposing than the discovery that there was a period when the earth was peopled by oviparous quadrupeds of a most appalling magnitude and that reptiles were the Lords of Creation, before the existence of the human race." This was a decade before the word "dinosaur" was even coined, so there's never been any excuse for not getting this right if you're trying for accuracy. Of course, old-timey Hollywood was trying for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a>. The reason the trope faded around the 1980s was not science marching on, but the general public becoming more aware of what scientists knew all along.
</li><li> It was once wildly believed and taught that dinosaur/extinct animal coloration would always be something fundamentally impossible to know, but it was discovered in 2008 that melanosomes, which are responsible for animal coloration, are sometimes capable of fossilizing - they've just been previously thought to be traces of bacteria or misidentified as traces of other things. Comparing the structure and amount of fossilized melanosomes to that of living animals allows one to infer the color of the extinct animal, and now there is a small handful of dinosaurs and extinct birds (including a long-beaked extinct penguin) with full <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_coloration">color restorations<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that are believed to be highly accurate, so now we can know awesome things like that <em>Microraptor</em> looked like a four-winged black iridescent crow, and there is a species of dinosaur <em>(Sinosauropteryx)</em> that was brown, had a white striped tail and underbelly, and had something similar to a raccoon mask.
</li><li> This phenomenon is very evident in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurCryptidsAreMoreMysterious">cryptids</a>, especially of the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingDinosaurs">late-surviving dinosaur/prehistoric reptile</a>" variety. Oftentimes, cryptids like Mokele-mbembe, the Ropen, or the Loch Ness Monster will be described as looking very similar to classical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockDinosaurs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockDinosaurs">Stock Dinosaurs</a>, even if more modern discoveries suggest that the described capabilities of the cryptid don't match up with the actual creature. For instance, Nessie (often purported to be a plesiosaur) is often depicted as raising its head and neck high to look out of the water like a swan, which was a common image at the time in media and paleoart. <a class="urllink" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/laelaps/why-the-long-neck/">More recent discoveries<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> suggest that a plesiosaur wouldn't be able to pull off that posture without breaking its neck.

<ul><li> This happened so often to Robert Heinlein that he decided to stop rewriting his short stories for accuracy and simply declared them part of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a>. His editors decided to call the whole "series" <em>Future History</em>.
<ul><li> His story "Blowups Happen" centered around a nuclear power plant consisting of a <em>solid two and a half ton ball</em> of uranium-235. Blowups don't just happen, but are <em>inevitable</em> when you try to exceed critical mass (in this case, 52kg). Considering that the story was written in 1940 and Fermi wouldn't even get to the University of Chicago for his famous experiment until 1942, he can probably be forgiven. Heisenberg himself and a number of other nuclear scientists also thought the same thing—supposedly Heisenberg's 1940 calculations on the "random walk" principle gave him a figure two tons for sustained criticality. <br/><br/>The mass was changed to 10 tons in a later revision of the story. It's not exactly a solid ball, though; in both cases the fission reaction is keeping the fuel in a liquid state. There's another error, though: even the ten-ton version simply would not contain enough energy to produce the world-wrecking detonation the story posits—it <em>would</em> be an enormous explosion, but historically there have been more powerful volcanic events. The explosion <em>would</em> likely release a ghastly amount of radioisotopes into the environment when it blew, however, making it a "world-wrecker" in a different way.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Lensman">Lensman</a></em> novels:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EEDocSmith">E. E. Doc Smith</a> justified both FTL and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFriction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFriction">Constant Thrust Equals Constant Velocity</a> with the inertia-negating "Bergenholm" device. At the time of writing, the negation of inertial mass, though hideously energy-intensive, was believed theoretically possible. Advances in relativity and quantum mechanics have since destroyed the concept's viability.
</li><li> Also, the first novel, <em>Triplanetary</em>, had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens">fish-like</a> aliens (more indifferent to humanity than actively hostile) raiding near-ish future Earth to steal <em>iron</em> to fuel their atomic star drives. Humans rapidly copied their tech and developed atomic iron star drives of their own. The problem is that there are two ways of getting energy out of atoms; fuse light ones together, or split heavy ones apart. As atoms' weights move away from the extreme light and heavy ends you get less and less energy out as you fuse or split them, and in the middle there's an element that's the atomic energy equivalent of a deflated balloon; fusing or splitting it releases no energy, and you actually need to pump energy in to change it in any way at all. That element is ironthe absolute worst possible choice for a nuclear fuel. At the time the specifics of the nuclear binding energy curve wouldn't have been well known, so there's every chance Smith chose iron simply because we use a lot of it on Earth, making it a good candidate for a material avaricious aliens might want to steal.
</li><li> Complete mass to energy conversion is also possible by the mutual annihilation of matter and antimatter. This concept does appear in the Lensman series in the form of the negasphere, which is essentially a planet-sized sphere of antimatter which is used to "eat" planets (in the process disappearing itself). In terms of Science Marches On, this point is affected by Smith's idea of antimatter being much closer to the tentative ideas that Dirac came up with when first considering the concept than to the modern conception of antimatter. It is also affected by Smith plain getting it wrong, in that while he correctly states that the energy is released in the form of floods of energetic gamma rays, he does not envisage these as having any effect other than radiation poisoning for anyone nearbywhereas in reality the gamma rays would be absorbed by nearby matter and their energy converted into heat, resulting in a massive explosion as opposed to the spooky silent disappearance of matter which the books describe.
</li></ul></li><li> In the foreword to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkylarkSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SkylarkSeries">The Skylark of Space</a></em>, also by Smith, he states that he is aware of this new theory of relativity, but that it's unproven and he doesn't personally agree with it. The book had been started in 1915, before general relativity had been published in its finished form (Einstein's seminal paper being published November of that year), and even special relativity was still not universally accepted among physicists at the time.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the series provides a surprisingly accurate view of antimatter, with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a> at the heart of its science being an alien substance that annihilates with copper to provide huge quantities of power.

<ul><li> The early silent film based on the book describes the astronauts and their spacecraft being fired from a giant gun. Launching a spacecraft in that manner would thoroughly kill the astronauts from excessive G-forces, which is why real manned spaceflight is done with staged rockets. This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">thoroughly discussed by the characters themselves</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> away by Captain Nicoll inventing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertialDampening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertialDampening">ingenious shock absorber device</a> (which wouldn't work anyway, really). Now it is thought that the gun thing was suggested to Verne <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">by his publisher Hetzel</a>, who thought that the rocket (which Verne envisioned originally) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">wouldn't be cool enough</a>.
</li><li> The book also mentiones zero-G environment only for a brief moment when the projectile was passing the point where the gravities of Earth and Moon cancel each other out. The better application of the mechanics well known even in Verne's time would show the zero-G state prevailing for the whole flight, as it happens in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>.
</li><li> There's is one even <em>worse</em> offender: in the book, the heroes get rid of their dead dog by <em>opening a window on the bottom of the projectile and throwing it out</em>. They are concerned about the loss of air, but they do it fast enough that "only a few particles" of air escape. It's mentioned they later casually get rid of litter this way throughout their voyage.

<ul><li> A great deal of biology is now known to be erroneous (evil sperm whales and the bottom of the sea being totally lifeless, for starters), but one of the more bizarre ideas to a modern reader is that the main characters find electricity so amazing, noting that their rooms wouldn't be out of place in a grand hotel if it weren't for the electric lights or that the Nautilus is powered by electricity instead of steam. It's likely for this reason that the Disney film has the Nautilus run on nuclear power instead. It is worth mentioning that the "evil sperm whales" is an idea actually held by Captain Nemo, prof. Arronnax doesn't necessarily agrees with him on it, and is taken aghast by Nemo's brutal slaughter of the animals in question. It was probably included more as a sign of Nemo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage">becoming progressively unhinged with time</a> than an actual scientific tidbit.
</li><li> Moby Dick himself was based on the sinking of the whaleship Essex, which is the first recorded history of a deliberate attack by a sperm whale on a whaling ship. The whale repeatedly rammed the ship causing it to sink and stranding the crew, who had to resort to cannibalism before finding rescue, which made the press worldwide. So it was a novel idea to throw about at the time.
</li><li> Aside from the biology, there's also some very big geography/geology weirdness in how the Nautilus can sail straight to the South Pole under the ice when we now know the South Pole is over land. Exploration of the Antarctic continent was just beginning when Verne wrote the the book, so it was plausible at the time, but now it just looks weird. (Of course, the NORTH Pole is over water, and submarines regularly have and do travel to it under the ice— and the first to do so also happened to be named "Nautilus".)

</li><li> Paradiso features a geocentric universe...sort of.
</li><li> Averted in one noteworthy case: Inferno and Purgatorio clearly features a round Earth (proving that the idea that people once believed, especially during the Middle Ages, that the Earth was flat is completely wrong. The fact that the Earth is round is quite obvious to the senses and easily proven through basic geometry known since Antiquity).
</li></ul></li><li> In April 1953, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> wrote the short story <em>Everest</em>, which got obsoleted the very next month, before it could be published. The story assumed that Mount Everest would be so hard to climb that the first explorer to reach the summit would have to be air-dropped in.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> cited this (in the foreword to the book) as one of the reasons why he decided to write <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticVoyagePlot">Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain</a></em> (despite the name, it is pretty much a remake)the novelization to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticVoyage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FantasticVoyage">the movie</a> had been as scientifically accurate as he could make it within the confines of the movie's plot, but that had been in 1966, and by 1987 some of the biology and physics were dated (the <em>other</em> reason was, of course, that he could veer farther from the movie's plot and therefore fix <em>even more</em> problems).
</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a> work, <em>Pebble in the Sky</em>, cites this in the afterword in later editions: "<em>Pebble In The Sky</em> was written in 1949 and first published in 1950. At that time, only four years after Hiroshima, I (and the world, generally, I believe) underestimated the effects on living tissue of low-level radioactivity. I thought it, at the time, to be a legitimate speculation that Earth might be generally radioactive and that human life could nevertheless survive. I no longer think so, but it is impossible to change the book since the radioactivity of Earth is essential to the plot. I can only ask you to continue to suspend your disbelief in that respect and enjoy the book (assuming you do) on your own terms." - Isaac Asimov
</li><li> A plot point in several <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IRobot">I, Robot</a></em> stories is that the positronic brain and humanoid robots were developed years before speaking robots. The first "speaking robot" is a room-sized supercomputer which can answer simple trivia questions and do basic math, and is first unveiled to the public when human-shaped robots capable of following complex orders are available for mass consumption. In short, it is easier to make robots think, reason, and perfectly replicate bipedal locomotion, than it is to make them talk. Nowadays of course, simple text-to-speech programs (not to mention products like Amazon Alexa) are available for anyone, while scientists are still struggling with bipedal robots, let alone anything close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>.
</li><li> In the late 18th century, Italian scientist Luigi Galvani used electricity to make a dead frog twitch. We now know that he had accidentally invented the battery, but some scientists of the time (including Galvani himself, by the way) thought that he had unlocked some sort of mysterious life force. In the following years, the "galvanists" used electricity to perform various macabre experiments on dead animals and even human corpses. It should come as no surprise that it was around this time that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryShelley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MaryShelley">Mary Shelley</a> wrote <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LucifersHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LucifersHammer">Lucifer's Hammer</a></em> has a scene where someone attempts to escape a monster tsunami by surfing the wave. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">It is epic</a>. It is also, unfortunately, totally impossible. Prior to the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami">2004 Indian Ocean tsunami<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, tsunamis were only known through eyewitness accounts of survivors, who were generally more concerned with getting away than studying the nature of the phenomenon. The proliferation of digital cameras changed that: we now know that the old name of "tidal wave" is actually quite accurate, as a tsunami is akin to a rising tide, only much faster and higher, rather than the monster breaking wave that most people envisioned.
</li><li> John Varley's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Millennium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Millennium">Millennium</a></em> was about time travelers who go back to the past to rescue people who are about to die in accidents. If they have to, they take people off of a vehicle before its destruction but it's much easier to just bring the vehicle itself forward in time if it was historically never found after its destruction. Varley uses the Titanic as an example of a ship that the time travelers were able to bring to the future because it was never found. The novel was published in 1983, just two years before the wreckage of the Titanic was found.
</li><li> A few decades after it was written, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpeakerForTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SpeakerForTheDead">Speaker for the Dead</a></em> the very bright and well-educated xenologists seem terribly narrow-minded in what might be possible in alien cultures. In some ways, this is actually Science Fiction Marches On, as writers explore more ideas that might be used in the future.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HGWells">H.G. Wells</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheTimeMachine">The Time Machine</a></em> shows the sun age into a red giant in less than 30 million years and somehow without turning the Earth molten.
<ul><li> By 802,701 AD, all diseases, pest animals, predators, insects, and decay-inducing bacteria and fungi have gone extinct. Not only would this be a horrifying ecological catastrophe, but it would be practically impossible given the nature of microbial adaptability.
</li><li> Likewise, the novel seems to suggest that global warming would only make England a tropical paradise.
</li></ul></li><li> Fellow H.G. Wells book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarOfTheWorlds">War of the Worlds</a></em> has a lot of this going on, being the very first alien invasion story and all. Like most alien invasion stories, it centers on an attack by creatures that are a massive step above the human military, whom the humans can battle and even eke out a few small victories against, but who still outclass humanity by a wide margin. Of course, the thing is, his aliens were scaling to be stronger than the military of Victorian England, and as a result, the fearsome tripods in the original novel can look a bit silly now, with their pulley-driven mechanisms and habit of being taken down by old-school artillery cannons, making them look more like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Insufficiently Advanced Aliens</a>.
</li><li> This was the downfall of <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Urantia_Book">The Urantia Book<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, a book whose publishers purported that it had been channeled from alien <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Beings</a>. It combined the basic events of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGospels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGospels">The Gospels</a> with an elaborate history of the universe, in an attempt to bring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a> more in line with scientific principles as they were then understood. Problem is, "then" was the 1930s, and the book's science included the now-discredited <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamberlin-Moulton_planetesimal_hypothesis">Chamberlin-Moulton planetesimal hypothesis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Mercury being tidally locked to the Sun (which it isn't), and an endorsement of eugenics.
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Radio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Radio">Radio</a></span>
</p><ul><li> The radio series <em>Tom Corbett: Space Cadet</em> went to some trouble to get the science right as it was meant to educate as well as entertain children. This leads to odd moments such as when a rocketship runs out of reaction mass (as opposed to fuel) only to <em>land</em> on Jupiter (which we now know is a gas planet).
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopGames">Tabletop Games</a></span>
</p><ul><li> This trope is a major setting element in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeniusTheTransgression">Genius: The Transgression</a></em>.
<ul><li> A Genius's inventions may very well work on outmoded principles, but that's because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">it's their inner madness fueling the devices, not any sort of consistent physical principle</a>. Also, there are entire realms of existence where outmoded models of the Universe are the predominant mode, such as a Ptolemaic universe where the planets really <em>are</em> crystal spheres pushed through seas of phlogiston by humongous archangels, or a version of Mars that's a lot like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JohnCarterOfMars">Barsoom</a>.
</li><li> The main antagonists, the Baramins of Lemuria, have a tendency to believe in outdated scientific, philosophical and/or political theories (ranging from Luminiferous aether to still being upset that Aristotles organon replaced Platonic philosophy!). They don't realize their inventions are powered by their own madness; they just think something went wrong with human development, and work constantly to "fix" it. Which is a problem if you're one of the people that needs fixing...
</li><li> If a popular scientific theory held by a large enough proportion of the world is disproven, the universe will go ahead and create a version of that theory anyway in an event known as a Maniac Storm. This was how the alternative realms of existence mentioned in the first bullet point above came into being. It's also how a number of antagonistic factions were founded; the Viking lander reaching Mars in 1971 and proving there was no intelligent alien life on the planet was followed seconds later by a Martian invasion, and the first Lemurians came about when it was proven that there was absolutely wasn't a mystical island full of serpent-people with advanced technology who wanted to destroy humanity.
</li></ul></li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Other</span>
</p><ul><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatMayHappenInTheNextHundredYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhatMayHappenInTheNextHundredYears">What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years</a>": A widely-publicized set of predictions for the 20th century as seen from the year 1900 included the hope that all these annoying flies and mosquitoes, along with their breeding grounds in the swamps, marshes, and other wetlands, would finally be completely eradicated. Now scientists are fighting tooth and nail to preserve these areas in order to combat the loss of biodiversity and the protection these areas provide against flooding and coastal erosion. Meanwhile, wetlands and swamps are still being drained, paved over and polluted with alarming speed; and mosquitoes are killed en masse to this day. The loss of mosquitoes would kill off many animals that eat them and without wetlands serious pollution problems would occur to a lot of water supplies.
</li><li> Various megaprojects:
<ul><li> USSR planned the change of the courses of the Russia's large rivers (Ob, Yenisei, Lena) which flow to the Arctic to flow to the Southern Russia. This would have caused an eco-catastrophe.
<ul><li> Which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a> in itself, the science being history. Back in the time the project was mired in the huge political debate of which barely a couple of percents of its participants understood what it was about. Nowadays, however, the picture has became much more clear, and nowhere in the project the rerouting of the rivers were mentionedit was all the invention of journalists seeking the flashy titles. Instead, barely a percent of the river flow was to be turned down south, incidentally <em>saving the very Aral sea</em> mentioned below: the great Siberian rivers dwarf the Central Asian ones, and even a small percentage of their flow equals both the Amu-Darya and Syr-Darya.
</li></ul></li><li> Drying up the Aral Sea was accepted as inevitable by the Soviet planners.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">It went as proceeded</a> but produced some unexpected results. This overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnologyMarchesOn">Technology Marches On</a>; had the same irrigation projects used modern (or even high-quality) concrete and canals, the sea would still exist today. This means there is some hope for it to return in the future.
</li><li> Although Kazakhstan is doing a decent job on their side,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note46ml0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note46ml0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note46ml0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Kazakhstan has worked feverishly in the 21st century to restore the North Aral Sea, which has recovered quite nicely according to The Other Wiki, restoring up to three-quarters of the distance it once receded from its port city of Aralsk.</span> the other former Soviet republics around Aral (especially Uzbekistan) just don't seem to care.
</li><li> Uzbekistan basically has nothing to export except cotton, oil and gas, all of which all but require the death of Aral  cotton requires water for irrigation (thus ensuring no inflow to the sea), and the former seabed just happen to contain some lucrative fuel deposits.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Eugenics. 100 years ago, it was accepted as scientific truth that some races/phenotypes were inherently inferior/superior. Although there is no technical reason the human gene pool couldn't be altered through selective breeding just like is done all the time with domestic plants and animals, the concept of "race" itself is now considered biologically meaningless.
<ul><li> Eugenics is the concept of trying to encourage breeding to develop desirable traits, the concept of race was never a mandatory on intrinsic aspect of eugenics. What was found is that while the *concept* of eugenics is still theoretically possible, in practice it almost always gets tied to race or some other arbitrary concept of what constitutes a 'desirable' trait; and often gets implemented in horrible ways. The science has not undergone any significant changes though. In short this is more of a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">Society Marches On</a>, specifically society not trusting anyone to define what constitutes a positive trait to strive for, or to implement it in a way that doesn't become a human rights disaster.
</li><li> To the extent that it was still useful or viable, eugenics basically died its final death with the advent of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneticEngineeringIsTheNewNuke">genetic engineering</a>, at least in theory. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PragmaticVillainy">Why would anyone go to the trouble</a> of hooking up the "right" couples in hopes that their kids would be better, when gene therapy could improve the <em>current</em> generation, or at least ensure that their kids would be better off no matter who the parents were?
</li><li> Many of the "traits" that supporters of Eugenics wanted to eradicate alongside genetic disorders were things like alcoholism, homosexuality, poverty, prostitution, restlessness, criminality, and antisocial behavior. The concept predates the discovery of DNA by over half a century, so its supporters naturally assumed that all traits in a person were controlled by their genes, none of which the listed traits are. At least not in a simple enough way that preventing alcoholics and criminals from breeding would have them disappear from the gene pool.
</li></ul></li><li> Any work that uses psychology that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllPsychologyIsFreudian">references Sigmund Freud.</a> Though influential on early psychology and still well known in media, Freud's theories have long since been discredited by serious psychological research. Jungian psychology has similarly suffered the march of time, albeit not to the same extent.
</li><li> In the mid-20th century, it was believed that tornadoes destroyed buildings by exploding them due to differences in air pressure. Survival instructions in the '50s and '60s advised people in the path of a tornado to open windows to equalize air pressure. It was later discovered that it was the winds themselves that damaged buildings and that opening windows wasted valuable time better spent seeking shelter.
</li><li> The Tomb of the Unknowns, the United States' monument to service members killed in action whose remains were never found or identified. Whereas most countries with similar monuments inter a single soldier, usually from World War 1, to represent all their Unknowns, the American monument has Unknowns from both World Wars, Korea, and Vietnam. But by the 90's, advances in DNA testing made it theoretically possible to identify all unknown remains from the Vietnam War, and sure enough, the Vietnam Unknown was revealed to be Air Force pilot Michael Blassie. Blassie's remains were reinterred in his hometown of St. Louis, and the tomb previously representing the Vietnam Unknown was replaced with a plaque that reads, "Honoring and Keeping Faith with America's Missing Servicemen".
