In the United States, about one in 50 of all firearm deaths have this as their cause, with some being children of the actual gun owners. Even in historical military contexts (such as the time of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">The Vietnam War</a> and sooner), quite a number of tenets of modern gun safety (such as always keeping your fingers off of the trigger until actually shooting) were not universally or thoroughly drilled into soldiers, though the required complexity for firing the sorts of guns that predated the use of metallic cartridges made it difficult for sudden-shooting accidents to occur with them.

It's less dangerous than most examples since her guns are loaded with Catian quasi-antimatter bullets that disintegrate non-living matter in a radius of about a foot but are completely harmless to living targets (other than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNudifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNudifier">leaving them naked</a>) but it's still amazing that she doesn't get chewed out more by Aoi, who actually is trained in firearms.

Also, Toshio once fooled around with a gun at the police academy and ended up shooting himself in the foot, leaving him with a crippling terror of guns.
</li><li> This is how you recognize amateur gun users in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CityHunter">City Hunter</a></em>: they tend to do stupid things with their guns, while professionals like Ryo, Umibozu, Saeko and even Kaori always follow gun safety rules.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>: In the Band of Seven Arc, Jakotsu is confronted by soldiers who introduce the matchlock to the series. After dispatching them with ease, he studies the gun by looking down the barrel. Of course, prior to that, he took a shot to the shoulder with little reaction. A shot to the face might not have fazed him much either. Also, the guns require a lit fuse and must be loaded manually after each shot.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Jesus">Jesus</a></em> had his revolver fall out of his jacket onto the floor in front of all of his new co-workers. The ditzy Sayuri picked it up, admonished him about bringing model guns to school...then <strong>put the barrel to his head</strong> and pulled the trigger. Only the fact that Jesus followed good gun safety by keeping the first chamber empty spared his life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheMysteriousCitiesOfGold">The Mysterious Cities of Gold</a></em>: Not knowing what a pistol is, Tao points one at Esteban, who's obliviously startled.

They were fingering the triggers of their rifles while arming up, although we don't know whether the rifles were loaded when they did that (still bad, though) and at least they weren't intentionally pointing them at each other. However, unlike the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety">soldiers of episode 12</a>, they're young and likely have very little (read: non-existent) training with the stuff.

After that, she points the gun at the lock, despite the fact that Mr. Green and Professor Plum are dangerously close to the line of fire and have to dive out of the way before she begins shooting. Then she succeeds in shooting out the lock, while Mustard and Scarlett are still just on the other side of the door she's shooting at! Indeed, one of the shots appears to go right through the door and graze Colonel Mustard. After shooting out the lock, she basically strikes a sexy pose with the gun, once again aiming it straight at Mr. Green and Prof. Plum, who have to frantically scuttle out of the way again. Colonel Mustard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">chews Yvette out</a> for almost killing him.

At one stage, he points it at Wheeler's head at laughs like it is a joke. When he is hoist into the air during the fight in the warehouse, he has the gun in his hand and panic fires several times, nearly hitting his comrades.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dobermann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Dobermann">Dobermann</a></em> Mosquito is shown to be noticeably lax regarding gun safety. He constantly keeps a loaded gun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantsPositiveSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PantsPositiveSafety">thrust into the waistband of his pants</a>. He pulls the gun at the slightest provocation. He gestures with the hand holding the gun; often waving it in someone's face to emphasise a point. At one pint, he holds the gun upside down and peers down the barrel, despite the fact it is loaded. Manu isn't much better; showing off his new sniper rifle by aiming it at Dobermann's head.
</li><li> A minor example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromLA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EscapeFromLA">Escape from L.A.</a></em>: the lead into the basketball scene shows a group of gunmen surrounding the court and shooting the poor sap inside full of holes. The gunmen on opposites sides of the court are obviously firing toward each other during the execution.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FearAndLoathingInLasVegas">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a>:</em> While driving to Vegas, Gonzo waves a revolver around and starts pulling the trigger. Luckily, it is not loaded. When trying to leave Vegas the first time, Duke blasts away in the desert  it's loaded now. After <em>that</em> we get the adrenochrome sequence, in which Duke snorts cocaine off the barrel of the gun, which is held by Gonzo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForcedVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForcedVengeance">Forced Vengeance</a></em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckNorris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckNorris">Chuck Norris</a>' character lends his girlfriend his pistol when he has to leave her alone, but she's so nervous she puts a bullet through the door the moment he calls out to her on returning. Our hero then delivers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a>: "Note: <em>Never</em> let your girl handle your piece."
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrozenRiver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FrozenRiver">Frozen River</a></em>, the main character is far from a gun expert but is, in fact, a gun owner and somewhat intelligent person. Therefore it's quite horrifying to see one scene where she's driving a car while holding someone at gunpoint in the passenger seat. Just to be clear, she has a loaded gun in her hand, with her finger on the trigger, and is <em>steering</em> with that hand. The gun keeps swinging wildly in the passenger's direction. It becomes hard to pay attention to the film when you're constantly waiting for someone to unintentionally blow someone else's brains out.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Go" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Go">Go</a></em> has a scene where one character plays with a loaded handgun in a moving car while his increasingly-concerned friend attempts to get it back from him before it goes off.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a></em> wavers between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseGunSafety">Artistic License  Gun Safety</a> and this trope. It's impossible to tell from the film when the actors are making mistakes and when they're portraying their character's blatant disregard for gun safety.
<ul><li> Karen in one scene hides a snub-nose revolver in her panties. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> in this case, as she is hiding it from a police search. Plenty of other characters stick guns in waistbands or pockets where they could negligently discharge.
</li><li> Tommy, Joe Pesci's iconic complete lunatic of a gangster, frequently violates the rules about not mixing firearms and alcohol and not pointing a weapon at anything you aren't meaning to hit. In a memorable sequence, he drunkenly waves a revolver around while comparing himself to a movie cowboy. He "flags" (unintentionally points the muzzle at) everyone else at his poker table. The other players are justifiably alarmed - then go right back to laughing. Tommy then shoots at <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Spider</span> while imitating a stunt in a movie. He accidentally shoots <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Spider in the foot.</span> It's arguable whether this counts as failing to never aim at anything you do not want to hit since Tommy is just a monster.
</li><li> Near the end of the film, Ray Liotta's Henry Hill is waiting for his wife to get back from meeting one of his accomplices. Henry carries a semi-auto pistol. He runs out to escort his wife Karen from her car to the door. He holds the firearm in a very strange position as if he were palming it, where the trigger might snag as he physically hauls Karen into the house. The muzzle rakes across Henry's chest so it might or might not enter and exit obliquely. Then the bullet would hit <em>Karen</em> straight in the side of the torso, cutting along from just under one armpit to exit out the other side of her chest. During that sequence, if the gun discharged, Karen's <em>heart</em>, aorta, both lungs, liver, stomach, and spleen were all right about at the right level to be hit.
</li><li> Henry is seen in the next scene holding Karen in bed. He has a drawn semi-auto pistol. His finger is in the trigger well.
</li><li> Early in the film, Henry gives Karen a bloody, loaded revolver to hide. Karen (presumably) has no experience with firearms at that point in the film. It's good practice to unload and clear a firearm before passing it to someone else. When passing it over, make sure it's open so the recipient can check to make sure it's not loaded. Granted, Henry was more concerned with having Karen hide the revolver since he used it to pistol-whip a man who sexually assaulted her just a few minutes ago.

<ul><li> One death involved two guys who have been friends since they were in elementary; they do everything together and are generally chummy towards each other, even deciding to live together as roommates in college. Unfortunately, in adulthood one of the two friends became addicted to cigarettes and constantly bothers the other for money so he can buy more, or for spares to share with him. Becoming tired of having to supply cigarettes for his friend, the annoyed friend loads some cigarettes into his shotgun and aims them directly into his roommate's face, saying, "Hey buddy want some cigarettes?" Being drunk at the time, he didn't seem afraid of having a shotgun pointed at him and nods his head in approval at the idea of cigarettes. The cigarettes fly out of the shotgun at supersonic speed and penetrate the guy's skull. He simply wanted to injure his friend; he didn't think cigarettes would penetrate flesh as bullets do. This show that you never point a gun at something or someone you are not intending to kill or destroy, and that anything flying out of a gun is going to be potentially lethal.
</li><li> Another episode featured a magician attempting a bullet-catching trick; when tapping the barrel of the gun with his wand, part of the wand's tip fell off and into the barrel, which was then propelled by the blank cartridge with lethal force through a major artery in his neck.

When he later gets a holster as a gift, he decides to show off by walking around the office while wearing the holster with the gun in it. When people complain about this he gets irritated and tries to twirl the gun. The gun discharges and he almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustShotMarvinInTheFace">shoots Andy in the head</a>. Andy's eardrum is ruptured and he goes temporarily deaf in one ear. When the company CEO finds out about this she is livid at him being so reckless. There is also the fact that he kept an old gun on his desk as a collectible without removing the bullets.

Justified in that he has no apparent background in gun usage, and is more than a little crazy at the time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason">Perry Mason</a></em>: If there was a gun involved in the murder-of-the-week, odds are good that Perry Mason will recklessly wave that gun around. One episode was particularly egregious: The district attorney, Hamilton Berger, fondles the murder weapon (a revolver marked as exhibit whatever) during the trial and rests it casually on the witness box, his finger on the trigger, the barrel aimed directly at the weapons expert's head. After a few questions, he turns it toward the jury, gesturing dramatically. Then, Mason does exactly the same thing when cross-examining.
</li><li> Showed up occasionally in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePractice">The Practice</a></em>, where lawyers would use evidence guns as props to help make their point, doing things that would never be allowed in court, such as pointing a gun at the jury and pretending to fire it, handing an assault rifle to a firearms expert so he can demonstrate what "spray fire" looks like and, most egregiously, handing a gun to a murder defendant and making him pull the trigger five times. Even though these guns are obviously not loaded, no judge would ever let them do this.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> doesn't draw attention to it most of the time, but Det. Carlton Lassiter has an... <em>interesting</em> relationship with this trope. Most of his behaviour delves into it but he actually follows a lot of gun safety precautions when you start paying attention. The common rule is "don't point your gun at something you don't intend to shoot," it's just that Lassie is far more willing to actually shoot someone than most so he'll point his gun at damn-near everything his paranoia and/or ego flags as a threat. Looking at it from that perspective, the only parts he really violates are the ones about gun storage (he keeps nearly a dozen loaded guns hidden around his residence, one of them in the <em>toaster oven</em>). Whenever he needs to hand a gun over to someone, he takes the time to eject the magazine <em>and</em> clear the chamber and in many shots he can clearly be seen showing proper trigger discipline.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RepublicOfDoyle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RepublicOfDoyle">Republic of Doyle</a></em> had a scene where Jake and Malachy are talking to an aging gangster. The gangster has a loaded revolver which he slams on the table and then regularly hits the table with his fist so the revolver bounces up and down. Jake and Malachy keep trying to move the gun so it is not pointed at them.

Not to mention that he then fires it behind his back, doesn't look where he's aiming, has the gun lying around loaded, chambered and armed, holds it loosely and lets it wobble around after ceasing fire, and points it at John while handing it back.
</li><li> In "A Scandal in Belgravia", he disarms a man and flips the gun through the air before casually catching and aiming it while holding the trigger. In contrast, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Irene Adler</a>, in the same scene, points a pistol at her assailant with her finger clearly off the trigger — just like the assailants themselves were doing moments earlier. (The assailants being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">CIA operatives</span>, justifying their knowledge of proper firearm handling.) He makes things worse by going outside and firing the gun into the air a few times (to summon the police, because he can't be bothered to just dial 999), apparently unaware of the numerous cases of people wounded or killed by stray shots and celebratory gunfire.
</li><li> Sherlock takes it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in "The Reichenbach Fall", where he shoots twice into the air in a highly populated area, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">presses the loaded gun to his best friend's head</a> with his finger on the trigger,</em> and later just drops it onto the cobblestoned street while running away.

They pull up behind his car in formation on their motorcycles, then a moving van pulls out in front and shoots out the back at the Mayans - with the Sons still behind them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSpy">The Spy</a></em> plays this for drama. The spoiled idiot nephew of a powerful general is introduced when he drunkenly hands his loaded service pistol to a bartender and demands that the man point it at him and pose like a famous movie star. In another scene, he points his gun at the protagonist and threatens him, but it turns out that he's only joking. The protagonist lambastes him for pointing a weapon at him in his own home.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateAtlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a></em>: In the episode "Common Ground", "Todd" handles a human firearm in an extremely reckless way while he and Sheppard are escaping. This is actually realistic though since "Todd" is an alien from another galaxy, so there's no way he would know how to use human firearms safely. Also, keep in mind the handheld weapons his race (the Wraith) use stun only. They use humans for food, and the feeding process depends on them being alive, so killing them outright with weapons would be counterproductive. He's simply handling the human firearm the way he would handle one of his race's weapons. The series averts this with the human characters, who always use weapons the proper way.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, avoids the trope almost a little <em>too</em> much when a museum worker is ordered by a guard to hold Cam and Vala at gunpoint and while he certainly points the gun at them, his finger is not even <em>close</em> to the trigger. To be fair, he was on SG-1's side and as such, had no intention of killing them.

Similarly, in <em>City on the Edge of Forever</em>, a homeless man robs Bones while he's unconscious, and promptly vaporizes himself with the doctor's phaser.

In the end, he ends up trying to physically subdue his wife's body snatcher (an old witch traded bodies with her) while holding the gun and ends up shooting his wife.
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThreesCompany">Three's Company</a></em> had Jack buying a revolver, proceeding to be his usual clumsy self with it (tossing it from hand to hand while claiming it was unloaded), and dropping it resulting in a discharge.
</li><li> A <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeTrax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TimeTrax">Time Trax</a></em> episode has Darien go on a tour through the wilderness with a group in order to find the week's criminal from the future and send him back.

He accidentally drops his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGun">Stun Gun</a>, which looks like a keyless car alarm remote. Another guy picks it up and says he has seen something like this before. Darien is suspicious (even though the device is disguised as a common object), and the guy ends up pointing it at Darien and pressing the button while saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">Beam Me Up, Scotty!</a>". Darien is stunned for a few minutes but is fine afterwards. Of course, one of the buttons doses the target with a compound necessary for time travel to which a person can only be safely exposed to twice before dying. Had the guy pressed <em>that</em> button, the show would've been over.

At one point, though, James May earnestly looks down the barrel of his shotgun and is yelled at by their guide, who grabs the weapon out of his hands. In a Series 14 outtake, May defended himself, claiming it was the only way to see whether the barrel is unblocked. Important Safety Tip, you never do that. Open the action and check from the breech end; light coming through the barrel without shadows shows an unblocked barrel. This lets you also remove any shell from the chamber, in case the gun is loaded - <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GunSafety">and it is.</a></em>

</li><li> In the final episode of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwinPeaks">Twin Peaks</a></em>, there's a love scene between Bobby and Shelly that has them playing around with a pistol in a truly stupid way while fantasising about killing Shelly's husband Leo, including Bobby sticking the pistol barrel first down Shelly's cleavage with his finger on the trigger. It comes in here as it isn't played as deliberately creepy sexual foreplay, but as both of them simply being completely blind to the danger.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWalkingDead">The Walking Dead</a></em>. Most of the main cast have some form of experience regarding safe gun usage (Rick and Shane are cops, Daryl is a hunter, Dale is the designated rifleman) but those like Andrea, Carol, and the others have only had limited exposure to guns and wouldn't be familiar with the basic safety rules.
<ul><li> In "Nebraska," Dave goes behind the bar in a barely-concealed attempt to set-up Rick. But he does so by putting Rick right between Tony and himself, so if he had actually succeeded in getting off a shot, he'd have hit his friend too.

He has several instances of reckless gun usage, including shooting up his own car with two magazines full of ammo, shooting a hole in the wall of his office while showing a fellow officer how light his trigger is, and pistol-whipping a 14-year-old boy in the face, causing him permanent blindness in one eye.
</li><li> The police aren't the only ones who don't know how to handle a weapon. In a Season 3 episode, Avon Barksdale handles a pistol with his finger on the trigger the entire time, waving it around and pointing it at his colleagues the entire time.

</li><li> At least one large coffee jar per month is filled with live rounds ejected from weapons brought in for servicing, customising or to sell or trade. These weapons were sweeping the staffs bodies all the time the weapons were being carried in. They always say it isn't loaded, but the staff checks it themselves (some customers actually become offended by this) and when the slide is racked, or manual actions worked, suddenly a live round flies out of the ejection port.
</li><li> One man decided to buy some 12 gauge deer slugs to celebrate the 4th of July with. He didn't know the things come down. Must have thought they go into orbit or something.
</li><li> One man picked a shotgun off a rack and pointed it at his buddy in jest. In the words of the late Barry:
<div class="indent"><strong>Barry:</strong> Uh-uh. Don't do that. I see him doing that again ah'm'o <em>tase</em> him.
</div></li><li> The episode <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5dh9pphlIQ&amp;index=82&amp;list=PLAFE8F6FAC46F3172">Range Jerks<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> discussed men who take tiny girls who have never fired a gun before to a range and show them how manly they are by handing them a gun so big its recoil is more like <em>thrust</em>, thinking that if he can shoot it when she cannot, he'll look more badass to her. Usually, he can't shoot it either, but the point is that the girl will be hurt by the gun; in one case one was killed as the snub-nosed .500 revolver she was handed to fire doubled back on her, <em>pulling its own trigger against her finger whilst pointed at her face</em>. Others include people who sight down the barrels of pistol-grip shotguns held up to their faces, and end up having their faces rearranged; and one man who fired a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Desert Eagle</a> with the breech up to his face, the slide driving part of his facial bones fatally backwards into his brain.

Many ranges have a rate of fire of one round per second, for safety. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">Range ninjas fire as fast as they can pull the trigger</a>; even "bump-firing" - in an indoor range.
</li><li> There is a constant struggle to promote muzzle discipline among customers. They never seem to learn. Daily, the staff has to deal with customers pointing guns right at them. One woman was at a local range and had a stovepipe in her Glock, suddenly deciding to step back and walk up to the range safety officer, pointing the gun at him and working the trigger over and over, yelling due to wearing earmuffs "WHY AIN'T IT GOIN' BANG?"
</li><li> <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_WTjjPyd2s&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLAFE8F6FAC46F3172">This gripe<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> has Eric and Barry discussing unintentional discharges they've had, and why you always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction, wherever practical. Eric tells of how he once shot a target pistol inside his mother's house and demonstrated to a superior officer in Iraq that the weapon he was in charge of shouldn't have a round in the chamber, as it is an open-bolt weapon - the hard way. Barry tells of walls, floors, and cupboards he'd shot over the '70s and early '80s when he was "full o' whiskey an' beans and didn't care about anything". One customer had a .45 discharge in his hand and ended up shooting his .357 revolver in the trigger guard, twisting the whole frame.

However, later in the story, it is made clear that she is <em>very</em> well versed in firearms use and was dead serious about shooting him if he didn't get out of her way.

This is a case of Reckless Gun Usage for the 1,000-year-old gargoyle that has no concept of firearms, and a case of basic breach of common sense for the New York cop who kept a <em>loaded</em> gun holstered and unsecured in her apartment in plain sight.

He proceeds to be <em>very</em> reckless with it, using it to open beers and change the channel (among other things). When the members of the local NRA see him doing this, they chew him out for being so irresponsible and kick him out. Earlier in the episode he hides the gun in the crisper drawer after Marge tells him to get rid of it; Bart finds it by accident, and Marge catches him and Milhouse about to play William Tell with it. The apple is in his <em>mouth</em>.

Thankfully, no one was hit.
</li><li> Then there's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie">The Simpsons Movie</a></em> where Chief Wiggum eats donuts off the barrel of his handgun, which goes off while he does so, but somehow he is not shot.

Wiggum then uses said gun to massage the back of the drill sergeant, whereupon he negligently shot the cameraman. In a later scene, it is shown Wiggum got his position because he gave the mayor the same type of massage.
</li><li> Wiggum also uses the butt of his gun to crack nuts open and then shoots one of them when he is unsuccessful.
</li><li> Wiggum scratches his ear with the barrel of his gun when he points out Homer Simpson <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">is that stupid cop off the TV</a>.

</li><li> Actor Jon-Erik Hexum killed himself on the set of the series <em>Cover Up</em> by playing with a .44 Magnum handgun. Joking around during a delay in filming, he put the gun to his temple and pulled the trigger. Because the gun was loaded with blank cartridges, Hexum evidently thought it was harmless, but he was still setting off a gunpowder explosion next to his head. The detonation shattered his skull and drove a fragment of it into his brain, wounding him fatally.
</li><li> "A youth who can't hit a cathedral at thirty yards with a Gatling gun in three-quarters of an hour, can take up an old empty musket and bag his mother every time at a hundred." - Mark Twain
</li><li> The page quote <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamMeUpScotty">(allegedly)</a> comes from the incident that led to Terry Kath's death. He was cleaning a pistol, and when one of his friends was worried about it, Kath pointed out that the magazine wasn't in the gun to reassure everyone. He showed them that there weren't any bullets in the magazine, then put it back in, put it against his head, and pulled the trigger. There was a bullet in the chamber.

Elvis then apparently disarmed and pinned Cooper to demonstrate self-defence techniques. Even if the gun wasn't loaded, that was a truly insane thing to do.

(In one documentary, "50 Greatest Magic Tricks", Penn emphasises that they ensure safety with a rigid series of checks before and during the routine and a stage manager with the power to call it off if anything goes off-script.)
</li><li> Russian soldiers have been photographed using PPSH 41s as stools to this very day (where it is used mostly ceremonially). Worse, for this to work the magazine is the seat.
</li><li> Stories of children accidentally shooting themselves with their parents' firearms are sadly too numerous to mention, but there is an even worse subset of young children mistaking their mothers' <a class="urllink" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-what-happens-when-you-sell-pink-guns-that-look-like-toys-2013-2">hot-pink "designer" pistols for squirt guns<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. While full responsibility lies with the parents, one could argue the recklessness of gun manufacturers as well. In the United States, toy guns are required by law to have bright coloration somewhere on them to indicate that they're toys, so making a real gun <em>look like a toy</em> to a child who doesn't know better often has tragic consequences.
</li><li> In middle 2020, a craze emerged where people on the MAGA American Right would point loaded pistols at their own genitals and take a selfie for social media - apparently to illustrate the emasculating results of voting Democrat in the coming presidential elections. One un-named Trump supporter actually did manage to blast his own testicles into oblivion by accidentally pulling the trigger.
