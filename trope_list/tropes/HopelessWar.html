<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>
<ul><li> A century of hiding from man-eating Titans has created a setting where sacrificing hundreds of thousands of people to 'reclaim' land from the Titans, getting them slaughtered en masse, is a practical idea because it means fewer people to sustain on limited resources. A setting where no territory taken by the Titans has ever been reclaimed by humans, where it is normal to be <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatenAlive">Eaten Alive</a></em>. Things become more hopeful following the revelation of Eren's Titan powers and the fact that they recaptured Trost from the titans. There is also an ongoing plan to recapture Wall Maria, lost at the start of the series, from the titans that eventually succeeds.
</li><li> Before the four year timeskip, a new war is introduced: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the island of Paradis, where the protagonists live, and potentially the Eldians in Marley, against the entire rest of the world, who apparently want nothing more than to see them dead because of their genetic link to the Titans.</span>
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eren's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopiaJustifiesTheMeans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopiaJustifiesTheMeans">Dystopia Justifies the Means</a> plan to destroy the rest of the world ultimately becomes this during the Ragnarok Arc. Even if Eren is defeated and killed (which he <em>actively</em> supports) and the Titans are stopped for good, he already won by destroying every other country with a stampede of Titans, which means that whatever isn't stomped to death by the Titans is practically doomed to an era of brutal anarchy and endless fighting. Also, he has supernatural control over everyone who <em>could</em> become a titan.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In the Anime series <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> starts off as this. Zeon was effectively fighting a hopeless war vs. the Federation forces, with all of their big cards pretty much played from the start. The stalemate is the sign things is going to go downhill for them. Other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">Hopeless Wars</a> in Gundam include the First Alliance-PLANT War (where the Alliance had to resort to suicidal last measures just to stave ZAFT off, though the tables were turned when they developed their own Mobile Suits), Kataron vs. A-Laws and the Federation vs. Cosmo Babylon. The losing side being the former respectively.
<ul><li> The war in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> wasn't even a long one. Less than a year into it at the start of the series. Over half the human race had already been wiped out. It's known in later series as the "One Year War", which saw the devastation of Earth, the genocide of several colony clusters, and a final death toll somewhere around 5 billion.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SuperDimensionFortressMacross">Super Dimension Fortress Macross</a></em>/<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> has a hopeless war going on between the humans and Zendtradi.
<ul><li> However, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em> franchise in general isn't nearly as hopeless, making <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Robotech">Robotech</a></em> a rare example of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Macekre">Macekre</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun">Simoun</a></em> starts with the protagonists' nation easily fending off all comers through superior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">Applied Phlebotinum</a>... and then the neighbours start catching up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BlueGender">Blue Gender</a></em> has a hopeless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Bug War</a>.
</li><li> The entire point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Saikano">Saikano</a></em> is that one of these is causing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the death of the planet.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AuraBattlerDunbine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AuraBattlerDunbine">Aura Battler Dunbine</a></em> has a hopeless war that involves rebels trying to fend off the Drake Army's conquest of Byston Well, and it gets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">progressively worse</a> as the series goes along.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SouseiNoOnmyouji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SouseiNoOnmyouji">Sousei no Onmyouji</a></em> The human exorcists have been on the losing side in their war against the Basara for the past millennium, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to the Basara having relatively long life spans and the ability to absorb the powers of defeated exorcists.</span>
</li><li> In every version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato">Space Battleship Yamato</a></em> (both the original series, the 2010 movie and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SpaceBattleshipYamato2199">remake</a>), the series starts with Humans fighting one against Gamilas, with Earth being devastated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyDrop">planetary bombs</a> and Earth ships being hopelessly outclassed by Gamilas' ones (to drive home the point, the original series, the movie and the remake all open with a battle scene in which Earth ships are outnumbered by a 2-1 margin, Gamilas' weapons are one-hit kills on most Earth ships, and Earth weapon shots <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">bounce away</a></em> from Gamilas ships unless heavily concentrated, the only exception being the weapons on the <em>Yukikaze</em>, prototypes of those mounted on the <em>Yamato</em>).
</li><li> This is the case in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YukiYunaIsAHero">Yuki Yuna is a Hero</a>.</em> The girls are being forced to fight monsters known as Vertex, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which are unending in number and are simply reconstructed after being defeated.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the last episode, they do manage to at least earn a reprieve from their attacks, but it's still implied they'll come back eventually.</span>
</li><li> The War in the North is this for the Warriors of the Organization assigned to it in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em>. There are only about two dozen of them, granted they are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">super soldiers</a> but the opposing force is overwhelmingly powerful. Consisting of several dozen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Awakened Beings</a> that usually take a four woman team lead by a Single Digit Warrior to hunt, the Awakened Being's leader is regarded as one of the most powerful creatures in the world. The Warriors only count three Single Digits among their number to combat dozens of Awakened Beings. Furthermore the Warriors' leadership are collectively unable to match the enemy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOne">Number One</a> let alone the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">the leader himself.</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">It's deliberate</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">the Organization has set up a number of Warriors they deem problematic to be killed slowing the Awakened Beings down</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fortunately their leader manages to fake the deaths of seven of them, including the protagonist Clare, with yoma suppression drugs.</span>

The animated versions make it less bad - but less bad doesn't mean "good," it means "all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FamilyUnfriendlyDeath">Family-Unfriendly Death</a> must take place offscreen, and we're spreading the storyline over long enough that we can't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll">Kill 'Em All</a> straight away, but it's <em>still</em> a miserable world to live in and not letting it ever come to be is humanity's only hope."

Basically, in his world, World War 1 didn't end in 1918, but just went on, and on, and <em>on</em>. By the time he was born, there was basically nothing of the world left, every government was gone, every resource used up. And then he gets super-powers, and the means to end the war. There's nothing to rebuild, and people start dying from rampant disease and starvation. Then Albion learns someone is responsible for all this...
</li><li> The war against God-King Lore in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Birthright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Birthright">Birthright</a></em> is a recurring theme among the main characters. In the backstory, the world of Terrenos was controlled by a demonic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a> that corrupted everything as he saw fit. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">a ragtag group of mages</a> was assembled to defeat him and while they were very powerful at first, the war against Lore dragged out for years and they were nowhere near close to hurting him in the first place, let alone defeating him. It didn't help that the mages lost their loved ones and with each battle, more and more innocents were killed in the crossfire. Eventually they came to the conclusion that the fight was lost and they made a new home on Earth, placing protective barriers so that Lore would never invade our world. In the actual story, the main protagonist Mikey Rhodes gets a taste of this trope when he is pulled from Earth to fight with Lore because he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> destined to kill Lore. As a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmfulToMinors">young teen</a> forced to witness <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">the horrors of war</a>, he ends up breaking too—though unlike his predecessors, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">strikes up a bargain with Lore</a> to return home and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero">serve as his agent instead</a>.

The war was still quite brutal, and bleak for the humans, as a good chunk of humanity got hit by several <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">Depopulation Bombs</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation">Terminator Salvation</a></em> double subverts it by showing that time traveling has actually made things worse. The T-800s come in a full ten years earlier and humans only have normal weapons (which we all know do <em>nothing</em> against the 800s), not plasma guns from the first version of the war, and while the main network and production base is destroyed along with a large number of unfinished 800s it's heavily implied Skynet has many many more. However, it would seem Skynet didn't go as heavy on the Nukes this time and the humans have A-10s and tanks. Skynet is also much harder to kill now. The original had one central computer controlling everything which could be destroyed, the one that got started in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a></em> was software distributed pretty much everywhere.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> franchise has an almost exact similar war going on between humans and machines. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/GrandUnifyingGuesses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/GrandUnifyingGuesses">Which makes you wonder if the two are somehow related</a>, only in this one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreBastards">the humans were the ones who struck first</a> with nuclear weapons (it didn't do them a whole lot of good).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TronLegacy">TRON: Legacy</a></em> involves the distant aftermath of one of these between Kevin Flynn and Clu. Kevin struggled against Clu after he began his coup to take over the Grid, but because Clu was largely created from Kevin's own body and personality, any attempt Kevin made to fight Clu just made him stronger. Ultimately, Kevin retreated and removed himself from the struggle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">having long since been resigned to his fate.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReignOfFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReignOfFire">Reign of Fire</a></em> the humans certainly feel that way about their fight for survival against the dragons while the dragons simply want to eat.
</li><li> This is essentially one of the main themes of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Godzilla</a></em> franchise. So long as humans engage in war, another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> will inevitably show up to wreak havoc. To make matters worse, a good portion of Kaiju are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> unless attacked by certain non-conventional weaponry (and even then it's a one-in-a-million-chance) which turns the war against giant monsters into an endless effort to just simply keep them at bay.
<ul><li> As for Godzilla himself, the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gojira" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gojira">1954 film</a> implies that there can't be just one Godzilla. The sequels confirm this showing that there is an <em>entire</em> species of Godzilla (and a breeding population if Minya and Junior are any indication) meaning that humanity (Japan in particular) is in a constant no-win war against an entire species of enraged radioactive dinosaurs capable of destroying a city within hours.
</li></ul></li><li> What the war with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> was becoming in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim">Pacific Rim</a></em>. The Kaiju were learning to adapt against fighting the Jaegers and destroying more Jaegers until only four remain active. Not to mention the Pan Pacific Defense Corps was pulling funds away from creating and maintaining the Jaegers to focus on building the Kaiju Wall that claims to protect the surrounding countries from the Kaiju.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fury2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fury2014">Fury (2014)</a></em> is set in the last days of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The Allies are marching through the German heartland, the regular Wehrmacht are surrendering in droves, and most civilians are happy to see an end to the war. It's obvious to everyone still holding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityBall">Sanity Ball</a> that Nazi Germany is finished, but the remnants of the SS are still fighting bitterly on and using any dirty tactic to, at the very least, cost the Allies a little bit more: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">Child Soldiers</a>, luring Americans into towns and then shelling them, really anything goes. In one notable scene to compound this, the protagonists see hundreds of Allied bombers streaking across the sky, and they look across the sky to see a measly <em>five</em> German fighters flying out towards them to intercept.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Downfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Downfall">Downfall</a></em> is set during the same time period as the above, but focuses on the Berlin bunker where Hitler and his inner circle are taking shelter while the Battle of Berlin rages overhead. Everyone in the bunker knows that the war is lost, and the movie explores their reaction to Nazi Germany's rapidly approaching end at the hands of the Allies. Hitler desperately tries to postpone the inevitable, trying to command units that don't exist any more or have straight-up defected to the other side against the advancing Soviet forces. Himmler goes behind Hitler's back to negotiate a surrender with the Allies (who are having none of it), his adjutant Fegelein tries to desert (and is shot for it), and many of the remaining officials (along with Hitler himself) eventually commit suicide.

The Council has just barely been holding on, and the only thing that saved them from being wiped out was the intervention of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk">the Summer Court of Faerie.</a> Then, in <em>Changes</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the war comes to an abrupt and literally heart-stopping end when Harry Dresden arranges to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMagic">a bloodline curse</a> to kill <em>every</em> Red Court vampire at once.</span>

According to Kitai and Doroga, the (currently nomadic and somewhat primitive) Marat once lived elsewhere, implied to be in another dimension / on another planet, (they lack the vocabulary to properly express it, and don't consider it particularly important) and had an advanced civilisation that was utterly wiped out by the Vord, leaving only a few refugees to flee and try to build new lives elsewhere, and when they successfully built a new culture, the same thing happened again. During the series, the Vord start another war of extermination, and by the end of the last book <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Alera is safe for now, but the vast home continent of the Canim has been obliterated, along with the vast majority of the Canim species, and the surviving Vord queen living there is expected to invade Alera in a century or so.

However, it is very clear that if the first queen had not been forced to create sterile daughters due to her initial contamination by Tavi, the future would be totally hopeless for all other species.</span>

No matter how much death and destruction the Agents of the Gun wreak, the Line's resources are essentially infinite and they always end up pushing the Gun back. Subverted in that it's strongly implied that this suits the Gun just fine - it is literally the embodiment of belligerence and grudges and the romance of fighting for a lost cause, so winning would be against all it stands for. It also helps that despite being constantly driven back, the Gun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsThereIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsLongAsThereIsEvil">can no more be permanently defeated than the Line can.</a>

Originally planned as a single decisive strike by the President of the Earth Alliance to scare the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostColony">Lost Colonies</a> into falling in line and accepting refugees from the overpopulated Earth, the defiance of the Dabog colony to the bitter (radioactive) end serves as an inspiration for the other colonies to band together against the aggression. While Earth has the technological advantage for most of the conflict, the colonists do manage to one-up them in several areas, even developing an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter">Anti Matter</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> that's used only once due to its unpredictable nature, frequently resorting to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a> tactics against the superior cybernetic systems used by the Alliance. It becomes a typical war of attrition, lasting for many decades, where whole fleets are occasionally sacrificed to gain a moment of respite. The horrors of that war continue to echo for many centuries and hardly any novel fails to mention how devastating it was and what mechanical monstrosities it bore.
</li><li> The war with the Sh'daar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarCarrier">Star Carrier</a></em> novels, especially the early ones. The Sh'daar have proxy control over most of the galaxy, while the Terran Confederacy exists on the fringes of their empire. When the Sh'daar became aware of humanity, they immediately demanded that humans become their vassals and agree to give up certain branches of technology (specifically, the four techs that are supposed to lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">The Singularity</a>). When the humans refuse, the Sh'daar send one of their militant vassals, the Turusch, to force the humans to reconsider. It's made pretty clear that the Confederacy has no hope to defeat the Sh'daar, especially if they bring in more of their vassals to fight humanity. At most, humans can hope to force the Sh'daar to leave them alone. It ends up working quite by accident when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Confed fleet ends up traveling to the Sh'daar past; the Sh'daar, afraid of temporal paradoxes, immediately sue for peace</span>. They then resume hostilities when an even greater threat emerges.

The city was a fortress high on an unreachable summit and its king made a deal with darklings that provided him with white phosphorus and poisonous gas bombs, while civilians starved in the streets. The attacker, king Masale, threw tens of thousands of people and mighty siege engines to attack the city—and they also died by the thousands. In effect, it was a stalemate but Masale did not want to give up, as Lynortis was the only thing that stood in the way of his conquest. It was so bad that the half-men—maimed survivors from both sides of the conflict, who decided to stay in Lynortis's ruins—worship "The Bringer of Peace", that is the traitor who finally led Masale's armies into the city through hidden passages, even thought it ended in a massacre. The traitor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Kane himself</span> was just tired of the slaughter and wanted everything to end.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em> has a few in the backstory:
<ul><li> The Earth-Minbari War, in which the Minbari all but obliterate EarthForce and arrived at Earth with the intent to genocide the planet. Even John Sheridan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompCushion">big victory against the Black Star</a> only served to piss off the Minbari more. Perhaps the most amazing thing about the war is that the humans managed to hold out as long as they did, in spite of the massive technology and power imbalance. Only when the Minbari learned something <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApeShallNeverKillApe">so soul shatteringly important about Humanity</a> at the last moment did they stand down. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> adds that the war was just as hopeless for the Minbari, as not only they had engaged in <em>genocide</em> to avenge a single man (thus ruining their reputation as the leaders of the Younger Races), but by the time of the last battle EarthForce had <em>savaged the Minbari merchant fleet</em>, to the point that not only had Earth somehow won at the Line they would have been forced to stop for months, even twenty years later, between that, the Shadow War, and the Minbari civil war, their supply situation was so bad the Orieni managed to overrun the Minbari Protectorate.
</li><li> The Dilgar War was one for both sides, at least until Earth Alliance intervention:
<ul><li> The Dilgar were a xenophobic race who had just discovered their sun was about to explode, and, unable to just ask for help, launched a war against the much vaster League of Non-Aligned Worlds to find a new homeworld-not realizing, or just in denial about it, that even if they won they would have come up on the radar of the Centauri Republic, who could have overpowered the Dilgar <em>and</em> the League at the same time (indeed, the Centauri <em>had</em> considered intervening on the League's side, and didn't only due the sudden discovery of the Orieni re-emergence prompted them to deploy most of their fleet to that border until they could fortify it). Then Earth Alliance <em>started</em> their intervention by destroying the Dilgar's best force, and things only got worse from there. Especially as they never revealed <em>why</em> they launched their offensive.
</li><li> The League of Non-Aligned Worlds was, in theory, much stronger than the Dilgar (indeed, <em>each of their major members were a match for the Dilgar</em> if not stronger), but not only <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">their political infighting kept them from mounting a coordinated response</a>, they were caught completely by surprise when the Dilgar attacked much earlier than expected, their tactics were optimized to deal with skirmishes with the Centauri and the Narn and, outside the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Drazi</a>, their commanders were inflexible and their crews were badly trained, allowing the Dilgar to devastate their fleets force most of the major members to put everything they still had to defend their besieged homeworlds (the only exceptions being the Drazi, who had stalemated the Dilgar offensive against them away from Zha'bar, and the Vree, who hadn't been reached yet), with the Abbai begging from help from their traditional enemies the Narn (who had an informal, if fragile, alliance with the Dilgar) and the Centauri (who had bigger problems), and even Earth Alliance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreInsane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreInsane">who were considered borderline crazy due their near-war with the Centauri</a>. Thankfully, humanity proved not only willing to help, but also not insane as they seemed, heavily armed, and capable of rallying the League around themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> The War of Retribution proved to be a costly mistake for the Orieni: sure, they caught the Minbari completely by surprise before they had recovered from the Earth-Minbari War and the following conflicts and while they were busy with the Drakh War <em>and</em> had cracked Minbari stealth, but the Minbari <em>still</em> had vastly superior technology that gave them the advantage in firepower (an advantage that had just increased with the introduction of improved weapons), active and passive defenses (they had even started fielding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a>, very rare in the setting) and tactical and strategic speed, many of their crews were veterans from the various conflicts, <em>and</em> they had recovered their role of traditional leaders of the Younger Races. That translated in the Orieni exhausting their reserves overrunning the Minbari Protectorate and being stalemated at the border of the Minbari Federation proper before the Minbari had time to significantly mobilize their reserves or getting reinforcements from the rest of the Interstellar Alliance, and only the Alliance being busy with the Drakh kept the war from ending in a few weeks.
</li><li> The Orieni tended to get into these: in the late 20th century-early 21st they started a war with the Centauri, who had superiority in numbers, industrial production, economy, space, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">the Quantium-40 necessary for jump drives</a> (meaning a larger pencentage of Centauri ships were jump capable, and their jump drives were of better design) <em>and</em> had less logistically-intensive weapons. This was a calculated risk: the Orieni believed they would eventually get to war with the Centauri and seeked to fight it before the Centauri caught up with their slightly more advanced technology (something that indeed happened during the war), planning for it to be fought after Drazi raiders (opportunely supported by the Orieni) had softened them up and distracted assets from their front and being a brief conflict in which they'd use the incapacity of the Centauri admirals to take a number of border systems and improve their situation for the eventual annection of the Centauri. When the Centauri soldiered on and replaced their admirals with more capable ones, the Orieni found themselves in a hopeless situation... And the Centauri being as furious as they were by the Orieni manipulating the Drazi while they were making <em>peace overtures</em>, they hit them so hard that entire planets were destroyed <em>in the crossfire</em>, and the Orieni could only return being a significant power due a combination of the Centauri being unwilling to commit genocide and being too distracted by other things to annex them later, and it still took them two centuries. Then the Orieni, who worshipped the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Vorlon</a> as gods, took offense at the Minbari and others getting them to leave the galaxy and decided to exact retribution...
</li></ul></li><li> The Cylons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em> nuked most of the humans and are hunting down the few tens of thousands of survivors in an ongoing costly war. In fact things got so bad the crew of the Pegasus started to cannibalize civilian ships for spare parts... by <em>force</em>. It became somewhat of a hopeless war for both sides after the Cylons lost their resurrection technology.

Their prediction indicated that even if they got lucky with Romulan aid or an anti-Dominion coup on Cardassia (both of which ended up happening), the war was hopeless. The only hope was to surrender and endure decades (if not centuries) of oppression until an Earth-centered revolution would bring about the rebirth of even better Federation.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, unbeknownst to these geniuses, the Dominion leaders were already planning to wipe out every living thing on Earth once it was conquered; specifically, to prevent exactly that kind of organized rebellion down-the-road.
</li><li> Ultimately subverted, as the war was over about a year and a half later, with the Federation victorious.
</li><li> On top of that, the geniuses' plan to bring about the Federation's surrender in light of this was thwarted by their fourth member turning on them, leading to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KirkSummation">Kirk Summation</a> by Bashir amounting to "even you guys couldn't predict what was going to happen in <em>that one room,</em> let alone the galaxy; people can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewDestiny">Screw Destiny</a> anytime."

The Blackwood Project has it hard— their resources aren't too vast, since society mysteriously forgot about the original invasion for the most part. And the US government would like to keep it that way.
<ul><li> The Mor-Tax aliens don't have it very easy either, as they have to struggle to adapt to earth and free their comrades and war ships that are being held in military storage. Which, of course, is hard due to the interference of the Blackwood Project. In fact during the second season one of the leaders of the second wave of aliens (the mothren) questioned another lead mothren over the choice of picking planet earth in the first place.

A Martian trying to fight off humans is likely to feel this way if he is being honest with himself. Mars has been drying, developing backwards and diminishing in numbers for at least two millennia. Humans on the other hand are breeding like vermin and are constantly developing new and better machines, particularly weapons. Even a major victory is unlikely to reverse these trends and will thus be a very hollow victory.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. Let's see:
<ul><li> The Necrons, a race of formerly humanoid but short-lived people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality">turned brain-dead immortal androids</a>, are reawakening after 50 million years to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">kill literally everything in the galaxy</a> and <em>eat all souls</em>. Oh, and they brought their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">gods</a> with them. Oh, and they were only stopped before by the entire galaxy being overran by Chaos — so their current plan is to just seal off the warp — which sounds nice of them until you realize that that's where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurSoulsAreDifferent">everyone's souls are stored</a>... Partially retconned later, but part about billions unstoppable killer robots awakening everywhere remains true.
</li><li> The Tyranids, a race of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">psychic locusts</a> that <em>eat planets</em>, have attacked the galaxy 3 times, being held at bay only by strokes of luck and the sacrifice of billions — and those 3 attacks are just Tyranid <em>scouting fleets</em>, the Tyranids having possibly eaten <em>several other GALAXIES</em> before heading to ours. And on top of that two of the three scouting fleets are still operational, the thousands of splinters of Hive Fleet Kraken are still roaming around in the fringe devouring worlds with impunity while Hive Fleet Leviathan is still <strike> barreling on toward Terra</strike> fighting the Orks but another two hive fleets are coming to reinforce them, and there's no telling how many Genestealer Cults <em>exist</em>. And even if they fall, there are hints - here and there - that something <em><strong>even worse</strong></em> is chasing <em>them</em>.
</li><li> Chaos is sending out stronger and deadlier incursions from their alternate universe than ever before — and all it takes is <em>one</em> properly psychic person turning to Chaos to allow them to attack anywhere, anywhen. One particularly insidious problem Chaos poses is that the Imperium has literally no way to fight back. Chaos can turn planets into Daemon Worlds, but the Imperium can never retake or destroy the pits of madness and evil, which will spawn horrors for apparently the rest of eternity. The best they can hope for is temporary containment, and as the entire Imperium just got ripped in half by the largest warp rift to ever exist, it's safe to say that plan is not working. Even the newly returned hero, a son of the God Emperor himself, seems to be doing nothing but fighting battles as they show up without one iota of long-term strategy. The only factions to pose a real threat to Chaos at this time are the Necrons, who have the unique technology required to seal rifts, and the Tyranids, who might starve Chaos to death by eating every creature in the galaxy. While their gods are not big on getting things done and their champions spend as much time fighting each other rather than the Imperium, every major victory they <em>do</em> win hurts the Imperium permanently. The reverse is not true.
</li><li> The Orks, being a race of fungus-people, are <em>everywhere</em> (killing one releases spores that grow more Orks) and nearly impossible to get rid of. The only thing preventing them from taking over the galaxy in very short order is that they have just as much fun killing <em>each other</em>. However, Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka is trying his damnedest to fix this problem (and as of 8th Edition, he's doing a pretty good job at it).
</li><li> The Eldar are dying, having destroyed themselves accidentally creating a rogue god/dess of lust — and it's strongly hinted that the only way the Tyranids or Necrons can be fought off is with the Eldar outfitting all of Humanity with their ancient superweapons, which humanity is too xenophobic to use anyway. Their <em>Plan B</em>? Capture enough Eldar souls in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum">hypertech soul capturing crystals</a> that they can create <em>another</em> god — this one a god of <em>Death</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then this one <em>actually happened.</em> The status quo is now wildly in flux.</span>
</li><li> The Dark Eldar are missing these hypertech soul capturing crystals, so they keep the god/dess of lust away by causing as much random pain and misery as possible, by doing slave raids and torturing the slaves to death. It doesn't work perfectly — they slowly lose their souls to the god/dess anyway, so their plan is to just steal OTHER souls to replace their own.
</li><li> The Humans in the setting? They're a civilization of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniacs</a> full of ignorant masses that worship a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyMostlyDead">(only mostly)</a> dead <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NayTheist">atheist</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">psychic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman">posthuman</a> as a god — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">or else the church kills them</a>. And they sometimes kill them anyway. The humans' current plan is to just kill <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe">everything and everyone not human</a></em> and they'll be fine, right? The scary thing — it's heavily hinted this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> position <em>really is the only hope they have.</em> Said dead atheist psychic posthuman is being kept alive (barely) by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">technology that only he understood</a>, which requires that thousands of psychic humans be sacrificed to him each day. Oh, and it's also heavily hinted that he's slowly dying anyway, from a combination of boredom and despair about what humanity's become. Oh, and in the latest edition of the game, the humans have discovered that the life support system keeping him alive is breaking down. Oh, and if he does die, it's insinuated that <em>hell itself</em> will immediately break through into the real world and kill <em>everyone</em>. Oh, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">secret police force</a>, the Inquisition, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">currently going through a civil war</a> trying to decide if they want to kill him and see if he'll reincarnate or not. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimDark">God, it sucks to be a human in a Games Workshop game.</a>
</li><li> The Tau may be the most "hopeful" or "positive" civilization in the setting — as long as you ignore the concentration camps, the fact that their race has been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl">under the sway</a> of impossible to disobey avatars of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVirus">The Virus</a> for millennia, etc. They even have active scientific progress and actually understand their technology. The problem? Because they're completely un-psychic their faster than light travel is much slower than that of other factions, and they're right smack dab in the path of the Tyranids... Oh, and one of their generals appears to have broken out of their racial mind control, which is a <em>very very bad thing</em> as the leaders of the race have spent 5000+ years on a breeding program to make their warrior caste the biggest, baddest, most bloodthirsty Tau possible, under the assumption that they'd never, ever be able to disobey. While Tau society is relatively stable within their sphere of influence, their constant innovation means they might be able to come up with effective counters to the orks and Tyranids given enough time, and the aforementioned renegade is still noble and focuses on the Tau's enemies, their overall presence in the galaxy is minuscule compared to other factions, and with their poor understanding of the Warp limiting their FTL capabilities it's likely to stay that way for some time.
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> (HERO OF THE IMPERIUM) books have a lighter take on the setting. Humanity isn't as xenophobic as first stated and is willing to work with other species, the more brutal of humanities' minions are offed by disgruntled citizens and soldiers, and many worlds are downright pleasant to live on.
</li></ul></li><li> One small relief is that the war is hopeless for Chaos too. Tzeentch, the God of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastardry</a>, is in fact in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopelessWar">Hopeless War</a> <em>with himself</em>. Tzeentch would <strong>die</strong> if he ever won decisively as he'd have nobody to scheme against and nothing to change if he ever won, so he deliberately sabotages his own plans and creates plans which run contrary to each other by design. Tzeentch is powered by specific emotions, however, so there is one way for the Imperium to defeat him. All they need to do is, uh, eliminate hope, planning, and change from the galaxy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em> is, if possible, even bleaker than 40K.
<ul><li> Orcs are still there. They outnumber mankind and most other races combined. As usual the only thing keeping them from taking over the world is the lack of unity.
<ul><li> And their skewed balance of quantity over quality. Green life is cheap.
</li></ul></li><li> The forces of Chaos are as numerous and deadly as ever, except that they have hordes of mutants and beastmen hiding in the woods (who, again, outnumber mankind), the spells that keeps Hell Itself from breaking through the barriers of reality are steadily weakened... And as the army book proclaims: <em>"Against the daemons of chaos there can be no final victory."</em> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">And they did win in the end...</a> Though, it's continued in <em>Age of Sigmar</em>.</span>
<ul><li> Adding to that are the cults dedicated to chaos, anything from individual hamlets and small covens to entire human armies that have turned to chaos and are actively fighting for it from within the Empire's borders...
</li></ul></li><li> The Skaven has been undermining all of civilization for ages, they are arguably the most technologically advanced race, with huge amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiTek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiTek">Magitek</a>.
</li><li> A more localized example is the Elven civil war, where the somewhat-less evil side has been fighting their psychotically evil kin for millennia. Both sides having suffered so much in the fighting that they are going extinct. Oh, and the latest plans of the psychotic versions have included undoing the above mentioned spells that keep the world safe from the denizens of Hell...
</li><li> Undead the world over are growing in strength, their armies of skeletons and zombies rising under the command of powerful vampires or vengeful mummies. Worse, factions within the two branches are conspiring to resurrect Nagash, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> lich with aspirations to kill every living thing on the planet and resurrect them as his undead minions before challenging the Chaos Gods to become the <em>only</em> god left standing.
</li><li> The last, best hope against the forces of chaos is a race of man-eating lizards, who only has a fraction of the knowledge they once had and have trouble coordinating their actions at that (Not to mention the fact that their plan is to separate all the races and lock them up in different spots of the world).
</li><li> And the Dwarfs are at war with every race/group/nation that has ever offended them (Which by this point means just about all of them), and once they finish any of their current wars, they feel morally obliged to start a new one to avenge the deaths of the people who died in it (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">followed by a war to avenge the deaths from that war, and another war to avenge the deaths of the people who fought in</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">that</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CycleOfRevenge">war, etc, etc</a>).
</li><li> Out of all this, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerTheEndTimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerTheEndTimes">Chaos won, the World was consumed by the Warp</a>. There was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayOfHopeEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayOfHopeEnding">"Ray of Hope" Ending</a> when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Sigmar</a> rescued a small spark from Chaos and used it to rebuild the world from scratch... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeofSigmar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerAgeofSigmar">which is once again besieged by Chaos, and the Forces of Order are struggling to keep the invasion at bay</a>. A big part of Age of Sigmar's tone is that the story picks up at the exact moment that the war <em>stopped</em> being hopeless, and the forces of Order began to turn the tide and come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink">Back from the Brink</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheMasquerade">Vampire: The Masquerade</a></em> and its vampire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a>, the Jyhad. Ultimately all of the wars ended up being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">called on account of the destruction of Earth</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheApocalypse">Werewolf: The Apocalypse</a></em>, the werewolves and other shapeshifters are losing a Hopeless War against the unstoppable cosmic force of corruption that is warping the Earth and will, very soon, either destroy humanity and all shapeshifters, or reduce the planet to a Hell on Earth. The shapeshifters <em>know</em> they are hopelessly outmatched and cannot win, and most don't believe there'll ever be a recovery after the Apocalypse. But they are determined to die with honor and dignity, resisting to the last.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">The Forsaken</a> are locked in three major wars at once: against the Hosts, vicious half-spirit entities that want to either cut the spirit world off permanently (the Azlu) or rip its walls down (the Beshilu), the spirit world itself, and a faction of their race known as the Pure which views them as heretics. The Hosts are nigh-impossible to kill permanently. Nine out of ten spirits are more powerful than the strongest werewolf, and they tend to be extremely hostile towards living things. And the Pure collectively <em>outnumber</em> the Forsaken.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">The Vampires</a> are also locked in multiple eternal struggles.

</li><li> The majority of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mages</a> have been divided into two major factions which have continuously been at war since before recorded history, with no signs of it letting up ever. Both sides have goals which could be considered simultaneously altruistic and incredibly selfish (although Seers of the Throne are definitely much, much worse), and even within the two groupings there is much infighting, backstabbing, and vicious politicking. If Mages don't fall into these two groupings, they are either 1) individuals who choose to go it alone and have little to no support network and probably won't last very long, 2) self-hating magic haters who have basically declared war on all other Mages, and will pursue this goal with fanatical single-mindedness, 3) members of the so-called "Left-Handed Legacies" which even if they aren't serving the agenda of some manner of reality eating monster, will still do some truly reprehensible things (cannibalism, soul-eating, etc.), or 4) dead.

Everyone else in the galaxy, with the possible exception of the krogan after forming their alliance with the turians, is far worse off.
</li><li> The entire reason the rest of the galaxy keeps on fighting is because the Reapers won't let them surrender, as it's a genocidal war, and to buy time for a special weapon to be completed. A weapon that no one is sure what it will do. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">The war is so hopeless that everyone is willing to put their faith in a weapon that, for all they know, might wipe out all life as they know it.

Now the humans are fighting a dire guerrilla war with the Locust.

Suddenly humanity finds itself thrust in the middle of a cosmic war between two absurdly powerful races, one of which, the Chthonians, seeks to revive their universe-ending deity and to that end sacrifices humans en-masse, while the Aetherials are perfectly immortal so long as they are provided with a host, and seek to take away their enemies' advantage away by extinguishing humanity first. Meanwhile the Gods on which humanity has relied all this time for protection are nowhere to be found and said to be trying to advance their own personal agendas, which pushes some of the most desperate human factions into deals with the devil with older gods. Several characters even note that the war was lost the moment either Aetherials or Chthonians were allowed to set foot in the physical realm, and a god the player encounters even states that the Grim Dawn (the aformentionned invasion) is but the beginning of humanity's suffering.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The humans of the UNSC had possessed hundreds of colonies throughout the Orion Arm. Then the numerically and technologically superior <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens">Covenant</a> attacked, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthShatteringKaboom">glassing entire planets from Harvest to Reach</a>. In short order, humanity is pushed back to only its inner colonies and Earth itself, with humanity taking roughly twenty three billion casualties (from an estimated pre-war population of over 39 billion), and any hard-won victories doing nothing more than delaying the inevitable. What's sobering about this war, besides the massive casualties, is the fact that the UNSC was filled with legendary badasses from the top of the chain of command, such as Admirals Cole and Whitcomb, all the way down to Marine grunts, like Sergeants Marvin Mobuto and Avery Johnson. And that's not getting into its SPARTAN <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldiers</a>, like the Master Chief himself. They were STILL nowhere close to winning or even ending the war. The only reason humanity ultimately survives is because the Covenant falls into a massive civil war, which ends up also killing off most of its remaining leaders (the rest having been nommed when the Flood overrun their capital of <em>High Charity</em>).
<ul><li> Let's put it this way: in only two months towards the end of the war, the Covenant loses over 200 ships attacking Reach (more than the <em>entire fleet</em> humans had available to defend it), as well as an armada of <em>500 ships</em> and a massive supply station (due to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifices</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Admiral Whitcomb</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Spartan</a>, and an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpook">ONI agent</a>). The Covenant leadership considered the first no great loss, and the second nothing more than a minor, if irritating, setback. That's how outgunned and outnumbered humanity was during the war; even early in the war, when the Covenant was dedicating such a small percentage of its forces that humanity actually held the numerical advantage in space, the UNSC was still forced on the defensive.
</li><li> By the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Halo4">Halo 4</a></em> era, humanity is partly recovered from the war, having even surpassed the Covenant in some technological areas thanks to an influx of Covenant and Forerunner tech. The <em>Infinity</em> is the largest and most advanced human ship ever built (not counting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientHumans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientHumans">ancient humanity</a>) and can go toe-to-toe with most Covenant ship and win. There's also the SPARTAN-IV program, a re-tool of Project ORION (AKA SPARTAN-I) involving the "upgrading" of veteran soldiers to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> status with hardly any genetic restrictions, unlike the earlier SPARTAN-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPrototype">II</a> and -<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykeBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedTykeBomb">III</a> programs. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">MJOLNIR armor</a> is also superior to even the IIs', while also being much cheaper. Basically, given enough funding, a whole army of SPARTANs can be created with no shortage of volunteers.
</li><li> All that being said, while the dissolution of the Covenant has given the UNSC breathing space, the chaos has also created new powerful factions which <em>still</em> seek to finish the job against humanity. Additionally, successor conflicts to the Covenant civil war (Elites vs. Brutes, pro-human Elites vs. anti-human Elites, etc.) are still being waged throughout the Orion Arm, with no side being able to gain a decisive upper hand (a fact made worse by many factions having to struggle to reteach themselves science and engineering even as more and more valuable infrastructure and equipment is lost each day).
</li></ul></li><li> The main background lore of the franchise revolves around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">Forerunners</a> attempting to save themselves and all other life in the Milky Way from the innumerable (and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">technologically superior</span>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent">Flood</a> 100,000 years before the Human-Covenant War.

<ul><li> The dwarves are fighting one against the darkspawn. Due to the darkspawn's overwhelming numbers, as well as the dwarves' low population and slow birth rate, they are slowly losing, down to only two cities (which hate each other). It's made worse by the fact that a large portion of their population is not allowed to fight, due to how dwarven culture forbids the massive surface-caste and castless population from serving as warriors. It's theorized that if the dwarven culture doesn't change soon, then it will be destroyed, even if the dwarves live on. Depending on your decisions in the first game, things may start looking a lot less bleak for them, even getting human troops to help out. Or, you could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">inadvertently cause them to be permanently sealed off from the surface</a>...

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">detonation</a> wipes out most of the enemy forces in the region.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Myth">Myth</a></em> perfectly illustrates the situation - the Empire of Cath Bruig has been razed leaving only a barren desert, the Free Cities of the North are under threat, and every day the Fallen Lords gain more ground.

</li><li> A gameplay example: in MOBA games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em> it is possible to realise your team is going to lose in the first 5-10 minutes, or even before the match starts (bad champion matchup in blind pick mode in <em>LoL</em>) but you cannot surrender yet and are forced to keep playing and getting your face kicked in by a team that keeps getting stronger until you can finally surrender - assuming there are less than two people on your team that choose to decline the surrender vote and keep fighting a hopeless battle. And since an early '11 update the winning team is encouraged to drag out the game for as long as possible to get more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">influence points</a>.
<ul><li> You can get worse situations in games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota 2</a></em>, where surrender isn't possible outside of professional games. While no one gains from dragging out the game, and massive comebacks are more likely in Dota, there is still the occasional game where one team will insist on defending for hours, potentially, before they can be defeated.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga">Digital Devil Saga</a></em>, it's heavily implied that before the events of the game, the Junkyard was in a perpetual stalemate. To the point where an alliance is <em>almost unheard of</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is quite intentional on the programmers' part, as the Junkyard was conceived as a training sim with the ultimate purpose of creating combat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> capable of responding under duress to any situation that popped up. This was to be achieved by restocking lost units and shoving adverse conditions on the commanders to force them to keep thinking of new strategies while never giving them any data or idea that could lead to an actual chance of <em>winning</em>, which would end the sim without ever completing its purpose.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBabylonProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBabylonProject">The Babylon Project</a></em> plays out several battles of the Earth-Minbari war from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive">Babylon 5</a></em>, mentioned above.

You are the captain of the colony ship UNS <em>Calypso</em>, sent to a remote system as part of a last-ditch effort to ensure humanity's survival. Earth is in a losing war against the Centaurians. While both sides are at about the same technological level, humans are limited to one system, while the Centaurians have already settled at least one other system (Tau Ceti is mentioned). They are also significantly more aggressive than your average human, and this ferocity is what's driving their desire to obliterate humanity. After a failed final offensive (contact lost with the last fleet sent to Alpha Centauri), the Earth governments unanimously vote to switch to a defensive strategy and start building colony ships. Each ship's crew is to maintain radiosilence and assume the loss of Earth and all other colony ships. By the time you arrive to Beta Caeli at the start of the game and wake up from your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanPopsicle">Human Popsicle</a> state, hundreds of years (if not millennia) have passed, and there have been no word from Earth besides a few messages several decades after the launch.
</li><li> The premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MuvLuv" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MuvLuv">Muv-Luv</a></em> is this, humanity discovers the BETA which quickly overwhelms humanity taking over Eurasia and reducing the human population to just 1 billion and with most of the world's adult male population dead frontline nations have started to cosncript females as well as teenagers and still humanity only has about 10 to 15 years left before complete extinction. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It does get better in the Alternative timeline where they destroy the BETA original hive on Earth and destroy its leadership allowing the slow retaking of Europe and Asia. However there are at least 10^37 BETA in the universe and Mars has a Phase 9 hive while the largest on Earth was only Phase 6 </span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicMickey">Epic Mickey</a></em>: Before Mickey came to the Wastelands, Shadow Blot and the Mad Doctor had pretty much won the Blot War; they have conquered Oswald's castle and petrified his wife Ortensia, an act which sends him into a deep depression and causes him to lose his will to fight, leaving the fighting to small, weak bands of resistance groups. One of them, the crew of Captain Hook, has most of the members dead or turned into Beetleworx and the rest scattered leaderless in the jungle. Another group, The Gremlins, has been more successful in fighting off Blot's forces, but the sheer force of Blot's forces causes most of the Gremlins to be taken as prisoners, and their own village was under siege before Mickey helped in turning the tide.
</li><li> Overlapping with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> is the war between the Shinkoku race and the Gohma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AsurasWrath">Asura's Wrath</a></em>. The Shinkoku Trastrium civilization has fouight the Gohma, the embodiment of the planet's rage, for countless eons, with no clear victor on either side, with Vlitra, the leader of the Gohma factions, growing stronger and bigger with each awakening after being only subdued each time. This causes the 127th emperor, Strada, to lose hope that the war will ever end, and would rather have the Shinkoku move to a different place across universe and abandon their home planet of Gaea.

Nidhogg, the leader of the brood that has been in the war, started the war because of his eye being yanked out by Isghardians a thousand years prior. The war itself has been more or less a stalemate with neither side gaining any advantage over the other while both sides have suffered heavy losses of life. You don't get a chance to alter the course of the war until the <em>Heavensward</em> storyline and you find out there's more to the war than you heard. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The war actually started when King Thordan and his twelve knights kill Nidhogg's sister and ate her eyes to gain more power. Nidhogg wanted revenge and led his brood to war, which eventually cost him an eye. Your allies theorize that Nidhogg could have easily destroyed Ishgard many times over, but had chosen not to do so and purposely prolonged the war just to make mankind suffer as long as possible until A) everyone dies from the war or B) everyone gives up in despair and become dragons via drinking dragon blood.</span>

Following this defeat, the Nazis deploy the first atomic bomb against the United States, forcing the would-be superpower into submission as the Nazis go on to betray Imperial Japan and to crush resistance from both the Soviets and China, effectively establishing Nazi rule over the entire planet and declaring the war over; the next fourteen years sees the Nazis completely level several major cities such as London all over the world, replacing them with cities more suitable to the Nazi ideology and expanding their reign of terror to every corner of the globe, with the Final Solution being applied to every person deemed undesirable by the Nazis and violently putting down any attempts at resistance with their superior technology. It's only after fourteen years that BJ Blazkowicz, one of the only soldiers to cross paths with Deathshead and live to tell of it, comes out of his comatose state to find that resistance is all but crushed, with the survivors forced underground as they can expect no help from a now thoroughly defeated US; only a few pockets of resistance in Africa and elsewhere still thrive, fighting a losing war against the Nazis as they slowly but surely wrestle away the few territories that have so far refused to submit to their rule. Blazkowicz's revival and recruitment into the Kreisau Circle where he reunites with many of his wartime comrades reinvigorates the resistance and they are eventually able to discover the source of the Nazis' advanced weaponry and begin to turn the tables against Deathshead's brutal regime, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually killing Deathshead himself in an act of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a></span>, but the Nazis will spare no expense in quashing the few who remain to challenge their brutal oppression of the world abroad.
</li><li> The Korean-American War in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homefront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homefront">Homefront</a></em> breathes of this all throughout the campaign; reinvigorated by its annexation of South Korea, Japan, and numerous Pacific nations in the wake of its newfound nuclear and economic might, North Korea establishes itself as the dominant superpower of East Asia and under the reign of Kim Jong-Un spreads false messages of peace as it tightens its grip on the world abroad as the globe is ravaged by economic depression, disease, and the decline of American influence politically and militarily. Taking advantage of this, the North Koreans paralyze the with an EMP that blacks out all vulnerable electronics nationwide and irradiates the Mississippi River, paving the way for a massive invasion in which the entire continental US west of the Mississippi has been occupied, with Hawaii and Alaska in tow. Without the US Army able to enact an organized and decisive counteroffensive, the Western United States is defined by a system of totalitarianism that sees the North Koreans indiscriminately imprison and massacre droves of civilians with or without provocation, mass graves, the loss of power, food, and all critical infrastructure, disease, starvation, and constant fear of being tortured by the North Korean Army. A few pockets of American resistance are all that stand against the North Koreans in the absence of the US Army or its overseas allies, and every attack against the enemy risks massive reprisals against the civilian population. That said, the situation bodes badly for a shattered United States that doesn't have the fuel, technology, or reach to drive the Koreans out of their country.
<ul><li> With the success of a desperate counterattack against San Francisco and San Diego due to the help of the American Resistance, there is newfound hope that the United States can defeat its Korean oppressors, with the European Union ordering an emergency session to debate military and economic aid to the United States' war effort.
</li></ul></li><li> The war in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Homeworld">Homeworld</a></em> certainly starts off as this for the Kushan, who in their quest to find their long-lost homeworld Hiigara which was lost to them thousands of years prior invite the wrath of the very empire who enacted their exile, with the brutal Taiidan Empire exterminating all life on their surrogate world of Kharak and wiping out all of their families and comrades who made their galaxy-wide journey possible; to establish the desperation of this state of affairs, <em>all but approximately 600,000 Kushan are still alive in the aftermath</em> due to the blind luck survival of their fleet, most of them colonists who have been cryogenically frozen for their eventual arrival on Hiigara, with <em>no children</em> among them. And if that weren't bad enough, the Taiidan have enlisted of the Turanic Raiders to quash the survivors. Suffice to say, the Kushan are desperate to ensure the survival of their kind when it becomes apparent that they are waging a desperate war against an empire they remember almost nothing about.
<ul><li> Hope returns however when the enigmatic Bentusi open up trade with the Kushan and provide them with the technologies necessary to wage open war against the Taiidan, giving them the firepower need to be a serious threat to the Empire's vast armada. As word of the Kushan's return spreads and as their fleet grows in strength, the galaxy begins to rally to their cause as does a small but powerful Taiidan rebellion that has become disillusioned with the Emperor's genocidal regime, forcing the Empire to fight on two fronts and paving a path for the Kushan to strike at the Imperial Seat of the Empire that occupies their homeworld.

It is the first faction in the series to have a "Legendary" faction difficulty. You start in control of the largest empire on the game map, but 80% of it is at risk of rebelling in the first 20 turns. Everyone hates you, so there will be a constant stream of barbarians attempting to carve chunks out of your empire for themselves. To make matters worse, corruption and disease are rampant, and it turns out that all those barbarian tribes are actually fleeing from the Huns, who will show up on your border around turn 100, and unlike everyone else, don't conquer and settle, but simply raze towns to the ground and move on. Up to Eleven if you set the game difficulty to Legendary as well, which disables the minimap in battles, autosaves before and after every battle and turn and doesn't allow any other saves.
<ul><li> A lot of the <em>Total War</em> games in general will see the AI get itself into examples of this trope quite a lot.

<ul><li> The Soviet military theorist Alexander Svechin separated all wars into two categories: 'Wars of Annihilation' whose outcome was chiefly determined by the military efficiency of the combatant organisations, and ''Wars of Attrition' whose outcomes were chiefly determined by said organisations capacity for replacing their losses. If the combatants have sufficient military efficiency, replacement capacity, and political will to prosecute it until the final victory/defeat then an Attritional conflict can be utterly ruinous even for the victor.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheTripleAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WarOfTheTripleAlliance">War of the Triple Alliance</a>. Paraguay decided that it would be a good idea to invade Brazil and crushed their army. Then, as if that wasn't enough, they went to war with Argentina and Uruguay at the same time. Paraguay won early victories, but ground down over six years. The war only ended with the complete conquest of Paraguay by the Alliance and the death of their dictator. Over half of the prewar population of Paraguay died before they finally surrendered. It got to the point where the Roman Catholic Church decided to allow polygyny (the "multiple wife" type of polygamy) because so many men had died there weren't enough husbands.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a> was initiated by the Confederates under the presumption that it would be a quick and decisive engagement. By no means was it imagined just how long it would drag on, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties even for the most strategically insignificant of skirmishes such as at Gettysburg, and result in the absolute economic deconstruction of the South, resulting in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> scenario whose aftershocks continue to reverberate to this day.
<ul><li> Union chief of staff Winfield Scott predicted at the beginning of the war that it would last four years and require a complete blockade of the South, along with a slow strangulation accompanied by massive battles of attrition. This was derided by just about everybody as the "Anaconda Strategy" and Scott was soon ousted from command. As it happened, the war followed his prediction in almost exact detail.
</li><li> The war might have been over soon had the North been adequately prepared for war. Instead they were caught on the wrong foot after the Confederates attacked Fort Sumter. The War department headed by the corrupt and incompetent Simon Cameron failed to meet the challenge for immediate mobilization and organization.
</li><li> If you watch the excellent Ken Burns documentary about the war, you can't help but wonder how many excellent opportunities to win the war right then and there George B. McClellan squandered throughout the first years of the war. True, Lee was a competent military leader, but more often than not all his competence got him was getting away, bleeding the (superior) Union forces and living to fight another day. Once competent commanders were put in command on the Union side (Sherman, Grant etc.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">the economic, manpower and technological advantages</a> of the North began manifesting themselves in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> s, though the South always remained a dangerous foe in every individual battle.
</li><li> After a while, the South's goal wasn't even to <em>win</em>, but instead to achieve recognition of the Confederacy by European powers (similar to what the United States itself did in the Revolution). They almost got that... and then Antietam ended in a draw and Lincoln used the opening to release the Emancipation Proclamation. Suddenly the Confederacy lost every chance of such recognition; if Britain or France recognized them as a sovereign country, they would be declaring support for <em>slavery</em>, which was something they would never do. This left the South's only hope with Northern stupidity, and after 1863 that was in short supply.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheFrenchRevolution">The French Revolution</a>, the uprising of the Vendée against the National Convention. If it wasn't this from the start it soon became this. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBandOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBandOfMisfits">assemblage of badly equipped, ill-trained and badly armed peasants</a> against the largest and in many ways most modern army in Europe. Some of the former officers and aristocrats who were asked to lead the "Royal and Catholic Army" felt compelled by their sense of honour and loyalty (to the king, the church, or their fellow Vendéans), but had no illusions how it would end. For instance, Maurice Gigost d'Elbée said: "it's the fight of the earthen pot against the iron pot".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>'s final campaign leading to his defeat at Waterloo. For all that the day was won by the resolve of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheDukeOfWellington">The Duke of Wellington</a> and Blucher's arrival as well as Napoleon losing his edge finally, the campaign was hampered from the start by the fact that Napoleon's army hadn't recovered from the Russian invasion as well as the 1813 Battle of Leipzig. Their only hope was for Napoleon to somehow pull off a stunning victory and this time the magic was gone.
</li><li> The guerrilla campaign the last remnants of the Republican forces carried still out until 1949 after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SpanishCivilWar">Spanish Civil War</a>.
</li><li> A lot of the countries that Germany invaded and occupied during the opening year of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> felt as though they were trapped in an example of this trope. Many of them surrendered after very short periods of time - epitomised by Denmark who, knowing that their small area and <em>very</em> flat terrain would make the Germans' task incredibly easy, surrendered after just <em>TWO HOURS</em> in order to spare their people the pain of a war that they didn't have a hope in hell of winning.
</li><li> The last leg of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> was a pretty good example for the Nazis. The foot soldiers obeyed Hitler till the bitter end, despite knowing fully well that German defeat was inevitable. Any government and people <em>not</em> convinced that they were about to be exterminated by near-human beasts (i.e. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">the Communist Asians under Jewish domination</a>) would have sued for peace. Compare this to the end of World War I, when the previous German government chose surrender when it became clear that they were less than a year (at best, and six months at worst) from total military defeat; sparing their country the ravages of a drawn-out war on their own soil, but also conceding to the monetarily crippling and emotionally humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The consequences of this decision was the creation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WeimarRepublic">Weimar Republic</a>.
</li><li> Japan at the end of WWII. By the end, they were literally fighting the whole world. Germany had surrendered and Italy, along with others of Japan's allies, had pulled a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, leaving Japan to fight on alone against The Allies. This was the phase of the war that added the world 'Kamikaze' to the English language. Even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtomicBombingsOfHiroshimaAndNagasaki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AtomicBombingsOfHiroshimaAndNagasaki">Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">several generals</a> had an audience with the Emperor wherein they <em>demanded</em> the right to fight on. The reason why the Emperor surrendered remain a subject of debate but it's possible the Soviet invasion of Japan played a part (better occupation by the US than occupation by the Soviets). It's <em>certain</em>, however, that the realization that his enemy had the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaponOfMassDestruction">Weapon of Mass Destruction</a> and he didn't, and could never get it in time, had a rather large influence on the Emperor.
<ul><li> Recently released documents showed that Japan's high command realized that the war was lost as early as the end of the Guadalcanal campaign (<em>February 1943</em>), but they kept fighting because they couldn't see a way of ending the war without losing face. So the war continued for another two and a half years until the atomic bomb placed them in a situation where they could no longer pretend that they still had a chance.
</li><li> WWII was this for Germany and Japan as a whole on a larger scale; in the long term, their early successes could almost be described as illusory and postponing (and worsening) the inevitable. The Soviet Union, after the sudden end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainTeamUp">the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact</a>, alone outproduced Nazi Germany by a factor of 6 to 1, to name just <em>one</em> Allied Power.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IranIraqWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IranIraqWar">IranIraq War</a> of the 1980s, a decade long stalemate which achieved absolutely nothing. Saddam's Iraqi military was too hopelessly corrupt and unmotivated to make any headway despite adopting chemical weapons, and too much of the Iranian military was inexperienced and ill-trained for them to make any headway either despite their superior staffwork and motivation. When one side is gassing villages and the other is sending runners to clear landmines by foot, neither side is expressing much hope for the aftermath.
</li><li> The Bosnian War was this for the Bosniaks until 1994. After being abandoned by Serbia and the combined Bosniak-Croat offensive it briefly became this for the Republika Srpska with a little subversion: The Bosnian Serbs returned in time to the negotiation table and got the best outcome of the war.
</li><li> Pretty much the entirety of Native American interaction with the colonizing Europeans on two continents. Attempts by native populations to resist European colonization and maintain self rule were ultimately hopeless in the long run regardless of any transitory victories, given disparities like the Europeans' technological edge and their introduction of new diseases.
<ul><li> Smallpox is one of those diseases and one that can destroy an army. It's estimated that smallpox killied about 90% of the North and South American Indigenous populations during the early parts of the the Age of Exploration.
</li></ul></li><li> The Western Front of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> seemed like this for years. There were great offensives on both sides, millions died, but the front lines didn't move. It took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisasterDominoes">a series of events</a>, Russian and Italian victories against Germany's allies, the arrival of the United States, the October Revolution and the Spring Offensive to force Germany to surrender.
</li><li> The Italian front of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. For the Italians, because their officers would continuously send them attacking well-fortified Austro-Hungarian positions uphill in the face of large artillery and machine gun concentrations. For the Austro-Hungarians, because no matter how many Italians died in futile attacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">they could replenish their losses</a> (in fact the Italian commander in chief Cadorna, knowing that his army was underequipped due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">endemic corruption in the bureaucracy</a> and the only previous commander in chief who understood modern weapons died of heart attack before he could make any impact, was <em>counting on this</em>) while the Austrians couldn't, and Italian artillery was superior and <em>growing</em>. Then, thanks to the Russian collapse freeing up the troops from the Eastern front and temporary German help in the form of assault troops, the Austro-Hungarians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">broke through Italian lines at</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Caporetto</a>... And things got even worse, for them: the Germans were transferred on the Western front, the part of the offensive sent to occupy the area with most of the Italian weapon factories was obliterated on the Grappa massif by a ludicrous concentration of artillery even for Italian standards placed there exactly for that purpose, the Italians may have been at their limit of manpower but were <em>still</em> more numerous <em>and</em>, as they were now fighting for the defence of their country, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsGetDangerous">had suddenly started to fight like demons</a>, Cadorna, who was incompetent as a field commander, had been replaced by the more versatile Armando Diaz, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel">Italian special forces started being everywhere</a> (they even dropped leaflets on <em>Vienna itself</em> just to prove they could have bombed the city), and Austria-Hungary <em>had exhausted their reserves</em>.
</li><li> Some see the <em>War On Drugs</em> as this (<a class="urllink" href="http://www.leap.cc/cms/index.php">including some law enforcement<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>). It must be noted that the <em>War On Drugs</em> is similar to the fight against crime that all countries have to deal with on one point: both are impossible to win strictly speaking and it's mostly a struggle to keep them below controlable levels for the foreseeable future. Unlike crime however, arguments against drugs are no longer as widely accepted as before with the rise of racial disparity in terms of prosecution, causing a lot of people to turn against the war on drugs like the aforementioned law enforcement of L.E.A.P..
</li><li> Afghanistan; especially after the Wiki Leak files made it seem <em>bleaker</em>. There's a reason it's known as the "Graveyard of Empires"; the British and the Soviets both tried to extend their control there, only to get bogged down in an endless conflict with almost nothing to gain. There aren't many local resources of note, and its only strategic use is as a corridor between South Asia and Central Asia, hence its long status as a buffer zone between viable empires in those areas.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PunicWars">The Second Punic War</a> was this for Carthage, as Rome's strategic advantage came from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlliance">leading an alliance of many Italic peoples</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">that allowed them to raise multiple armies with little trouble</a>, an alliance that Hannibal, in spite of his efforts, could not break where it counted. This became evident after the Battle of Cannae, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">in which most of the Roman army was destroyed</a>: Hannibal hoped that his victory would break the alliance and scare the Romans into suing for peace, and to make sure he sent an ultimatum to Rome, but while many Greek colonies, the Samnites and even Capua (the second largest and most prosperous city of Italy after Rome itself, and as close to be a Roman city as it could at the time without having voting rights) did switch sides and the Macedons (from Greece) saw this as the right moment to settle their own dispute with Rome's allies in Greece, the Etruscans, the Umbrians and the Latins, that is the largest (and, in the case of the Etruscans, the richest) Italic peoples and the ones placed right around Rome, remained loyal, resulting in Rome quickly raising enough troops to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathOfAThousandCuts">torment Hannibal's army with guerilla tactics</a> and attack all of Hannibal's allies (Macedons included) <em>and</em> his bases in <em>Spain</em> and still have some spare manpower and replying to Hannibal's ultimatum by <em>demanding the rent of the public land occupied by his camp</em>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse">Then</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere">the Macedons made peace with Rome</a>...
<ul><li> The Third Punic War even more so, from the Carthaginian perspective. Imagine the situation: your once proud civilization, which used to have a great empire stretching across your known world, has been reduced to a single city and the land immediately around it. You've been beaten, <em>twice</em>, by a people for whom war is the national pastime, and now they're coming to finally finish the job. Their territory covers the entire western Mediterranean, they've proven time and time again how good they are at war, and now 80,000 of them are outside the gates. When they get in - and, really, you know they will - they will kill or enslave <em>everybody</em>. And there is nothing you can do to stop them.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LusitanianWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LusitanianWars">Lusitanian Wars</a>. Not matter how many victories Viriathus and the Lusitanians scored over the Romans, Rome's sheer imperial enormity and amount of resources and manpower ensured that any lost battle for them would be followed by the arrival of an even bigger, angrier army. Even worse: very unlike Arminius's cold and harsh Germania, Hispania was a succulent territory due to its immensely rich natural resources, warm climate, and political significance after the Second Punic War, which means Rome would just <em>never</em> give up trying to conquer it. Viriathus eventually realized this and capitalized on a particularly nasty Roman loss to impose a peace treaty that would turn the Lusitanians into free allies of Rome, hoping it to end the conflict forever, but Rome would only accept peace in their own terms and broke the treaty in less of a year. When Viriathus was murdered by his own emissaries after those were bribed by Roman general Caepio, any possible option for the Lusitanians that weren't submission and conquest was definitely gone.
<ul><li> The last phase of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CeltiberianWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CeltiberianWars">Celtiberian Wars</a> was much worse for the Numantines, as while Viriathus had at least enjoyed the support of most of his tribe and many other peoples that joined his army, this new conflict was essentially a single, insignificant city against all the power of Rome. They beat the odds many times through sheer guts and a smart usage of Numantia's natural defenses, as they had done in the past against a much less focused Rome, but when the Roman senate decided <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">There Is No Kill Like Overkill</a> and sent to Hispania the man who had conquered and destroyed Carthage, it became a matter of time that Numantia suffered the same fate.
</li></ul></li><li> The Jewish Revolts against the Roman Empire can be seen as this. You have on one end a group of people who are fighting for their faith, taking cities and defending them to the last man (occasionally literally — Josephus was the only prisoner taken from Masada), or fighting guerrilla campaigns that needle the enemy's weak points. On the other side, you have one of the most powerful empires in existence, going to enormous lengths to bring out and break the revolting cities, up to and including <em>moving mountains</em>. When it ended, it resulted in the expulsion of <em>an entire religious group</em>, and came at a massive cost to the Roman Empire.
</li><li> The Syrian Civil War has become one of these. The Government and allies, Rebels, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria(ISIS) and Kurdish groups are in a war against each other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">with no end in sight</a> and the Rebels themselves are not a single entity and are in fact several groups with ideologies that range from secular democratic to Islamic extremists that are no different from ISIS themselves and unsurprisingly infighting is common to the point that some fight other groups than fighting the Government or ISIS. As of 2019, the government and the Kurds are in control of 62% and 27% of the country - the largest out of all factions - and they have began pacification process between them while ISIS has largely collapsed, though several independent jihadist groups still operate independently in Syria. Everyone is willing to kill civilians to get rid of their enemies using sucide attacks, chemical weapons and shelling civilian areas without mercy just because they are under enemy control. A large amount of Syrians are either dead or fled the country and most of the country is in ruins so even if one side wins Syria will no longer be the same.
<ul><li> It is also worth noting that there are about 38 countries involved either directly (Air strikes, boots on the ground, military advisers...) or indirectly (financing and/or arming one or more of the many sides) turning this conflict into the biggest proxy war since the Cold War days.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThirtyYearsWar">Thirty Years' War</a> was, simply put, the most devastating war ever fought on European soil (and yes, that's also counting <em>both</em> World Wars) and is the starting point for wide spread <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">depictions of war as a living nightmare</a> for good reasons. What started as a power struggle between Catholics and Protestants in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HolyRomanEmpire">Holy Roman Empire</a> eventually escalated into a conflict were everyone was fighting each other for territorial control and changing sides as they saw fit. Nobody was safe from the war as mercenary armies frequently raided villages to sustain their armies, causing mass starvation among the civilian population and worsening the effects of the already devastating epidemics caused by constant relocation of troops. Armies would also frequently kidnap women and children to be used as either servants or prostitutes, causing entire generations to be born fighting in constant war and knowing nothing about outside world. High desertion rates due to unpaid salaries among these armies would only cause further havoc among the civilian population as these deserters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousDeserter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousDeserter">would quickly turn to banditry</a> to make themselves a living. For a while, it really looked like it was going to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">Forever War</a> as <em>nobody could afford to stop the armies from fighting</em> and it was much easier to just pay them by raiding the enemy lands over and over again. The war only stopped after the Holy Roman Emperor was forced to pay all the bills, finally giving the victors a cheap way to exit the war and pay their troops. It remains the longest continuous war ever fought and it's estimated that about 1/3 of the Holy Roman population died in the war. To put that into perspective, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany">Nazi Germany</a> lost about 8% of its population during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>
</li><li> Many people who work in social services and mental health occupations with lower-income and at-risk persons and populations, as well as those served by those workers see the struggle for mental health and personal freedom in the face of an apathetic and dehumanizing society as this trope.
