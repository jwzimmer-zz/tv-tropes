</p><p>It seems that, when comedy is concerned, sexual attraction to children is as good a source of laughs as anything else, <em>especially</em> when the person being persecuted is innocent (of that particular crime).
</p><p>It usually goes like this: A small child grabs the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> the main characters are trying to fetch, or is otherwise important to the plot in some way — they might be children of the boss to whom they have to suck up, or even a MacGuffin themselves. As the main characters approach the child, unaware of how to behave and how to act, it seems to onlookers (and to the viewer, if they weren't in on the plot) that the interest in the kid is of a sexual nature.
</p><p>The kid might scream, or parents/nannies might overlook the conversation and come to the wrong conclusion, but it usually ends with several parents chasing the would-be-creep with peppersprays, purses filled with bricks and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaserTagWeakness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaserTagWeakness">TASER guns</a>. If he's a villain, we laugh. If he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnsympatheticComedyProtagonist">Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonist</a>, we also laugh. If he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaedoHunt">actual paedophile</a>, the trope doesn't really apply.

Guess they'll have to live with being mistaken for paedophiles all their lives.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In episode 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noragami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Noragami">Noragami</a></em>, when we first meet Kofuku and Daikoku:
<div class="indent"><strong>Yato</strong>: <em>[to Hiyori and Yukine]</em> Be careful. Don't look that guy in the eyes. <br/><strong>Hiyori and Yukine</strong>: Huh? <br/><strong>Yato</strong>: Doing that can be dangerous. You might never get away. Despite his tough exterior... <em>he has a thing for kids like you!</em>
</div><div class="indent"><em>[Cut to Hiyori and Yukine's horrified expressions, and Daikoku's pissed off expression.]</em> <br/><strong>Daikoku</strong>: <em><strong>DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT! YOU MAKE ME SOUND SIIIIICK!</strong></em> <br/><em>[Daikoku is so pissed, he literally </em>kicks Yato<em> into the sky.]</em>
</div><ul><li> Just to clarify, Daikoku loves kids, he does not <em>love</em> them.
</li></ul></li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/StrawberryMarshmallow">Strawberry Marshmallow</a></em>, a door-to-door cosmetics salesmen is our mistaken-for-LKL victim for the day, due to a combination of Miu's false accusations, an innocent attempt to comfort Matsuri, Matsuri's failure to explain said attempt as such, and his eerie tendency to hit every house in a group of girls who hang out together. He gets a shiner (and incentive to quit) for his troubles.
</li><li> While <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">the anime</a> is ambiguous about this (except for the unaired last episode that was actively trying to be kept from airing) The doctor in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> manga is most definetly not into girls, despite hanging around playgrounds and watching young girls. Having been given a sour opinion of adult women by his overly sexual mother, he came to appreciate the innocence of his young cousin, and when his cousin grew up he tried to recapture the feeling he had.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IceRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IceRevolution">Ice Revolution</a></em>, tomboy Masaki wants to become more ladylike in order to become a better figure skater and to gain the attention of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a>. She completely uses the wrong word choice when asking her much older coach for help in this regard ("Please... make me a woman!") with predictable results.
</li><li> In <em>Kodomo no Jikan</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilleFatale">Rin</a> nearly gets Aoki-sensei arrested at one point, complete with "It's not what it looks like! I'm her teacher!" "That's WORSE!" exchange.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RecorderAndRandsell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RecorderAndRandsell">Recorder and Randsell</a></em>, eleven-year-old Atsushi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">acts like any kid his age would (if a bit clueless)</a>, but he also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">looks like a grown man</a>. The poor kid gets arrested <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">several times a week</a> for doing things like playing tag. Thankfully, the local cops are a reasonable bunch.
</li><li> Yuki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WanderingSon">Wandering Son</a></em> gets mistaken for this by her boyfriend when he walks in on her being a bit too touchy with Takatsuki, who at the time was a fifth grader.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em> Kyoko's father dons an overcoat, dark glasses, and mask to spy on Godai at his place of work. Unfortunately, said place of work is a day care center, and a cop happens to be passing by...
</li></ul><ul><li> Masumi Sera from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>. After she says that she wants to go to Ran's house to see Conan (because she has been investigating him), Sonoko calls her a paedophile.
</li><li> Doranbalt of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>. Erza is convinced that he's a paedophile, as seen when he pops out during her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">of Jellal leaving her for being turned into a little kid</span>. Probably the rest of Fairy Tail thinks the same after he chose Wendy out of all the mages as a partner for the S-Class trials despite there being no relation between them both.
</li><li> In the one-shot manga <em>Forever Honey</em> one of the neighbors is implied to think that Ozuka, a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a> who's a freelance photographer, takes illicit pictures of his daughter.
</li><li> When Seo first appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MonthlyGirlsNozakiKun">Monthly Girls' Nozaki-kun</a></em>, she mistakes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a> Nozaki as a paedophile due to the latter's recent closeness with the tiny Sakura.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LogHorizon">Log Horizon</a></em> Shiroe took his friends and guild members, Akatsuki and Minori, to a cake-eating contest. Despite this not being a date, he was suspected of two-timing and, due to both apparently being middle schoolers, being a paedophile. One of his cakes even had "Die <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoliconAndShotacon">lolicon</a>" iced on top.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlackBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BlackBullet">Black Bullet</a></em>, this happens to Rentaro a lot, because he works and lives with several of the Cursed Children and treats them like little sisters, but they often fall in love with him.
</li><li> Not played for laughs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GunslingerGirl">Gunslinger Girl</a></em>. It's made clear a lot of people at the Social Welfare Agency think the bond between the girls and their adult <em>fratello</em> is pedophilic. While most of the girls have crushes on their handlers it's almost always unrequited, with the exception being Petra who is a few years older than the other girls.
</li><li> In Chapter 41 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldIsStillBeautiful">The World is Still Beautiful</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Bardouin</a> jokingly flirts with his colleague Violetta's younger sister and is poking her cheeks when Nike, Neil and Violetta walk in on him - it looks suggestive enough for Violetta to go berserk and make him repeat endlessly "lolicons are criminals".
</li><li> Much to his dismay, Hiiro Okamura from <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonjikiNoWordmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/KonjikiNoWordmaster">Konjiki No Wordmaster</a></em> is mistaken for a paedophile by <em>the level-up system</em> due to his uncanny ability to unintentionally charm young girls. It even grants him the Title "Little Girl Slayer".
</li><li> Played for drama in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Erased" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Erased">ERASED</a></em>, where this misunderstanding is used as evidence to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice">convict Yuuki</a>, a young man known for hanging around kids, of serially kidnapping and murdering three children. The real killer deliberately used Yuuki's reputation to pin the crimes on him, even going so far as to plant homosexual-related books in his room to explain the one male victim.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Gate">Gate</a></em>, Kouji Sugawara starts teaching the young girl Sherry Thierry Japanese, but she gets a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">Precocious Crush</a> on him and asks him to marry her. Plus, she innocently makes comments about him that sound inappropriate like, "we have a lot of fun during our private lessons". Everybody glares at Sugawara while he desperately explains it's not what they think.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Working">WORKING!!</a></em>, Souta, who professes to love small, cute things is often mistaken by people not familiar with him for being a potential pedophile. Even people who ARE familiar with him have their suspicions, such as Jun Satou, who in one episode states that seeing Souta taking care of a lost child made him uneasy.

He goes over to her and says "Are you lost, miss?", and she instantly assumes he's hitting on her. When Tsuchida arrives at school, it turns out the girl (named Anzu) is one of his students, and she remarks on his "hitting on" her...with several of the childrens' mothers within earshot.

Falsely, as it turns out: 1. A claim the man was guilty of indecent exposure was indeed substantiated, except it was while he was in college and committed the act during a night of stupid, drunken behavior (not unlike the other officers and main protagonist Chief Gillespie during their younger, wilder days); 2. His leaving his previous job under unexplained circumstances came after he suffered a nervous breakdown in class, shortly after the deaths of his parents, and he took a leave of absence that he never returned from; 3. The boy who made the accusations, upon being confronted by Gillespie that they were able to prove nothing happened, admits he made the charges up. Even with the facts squarely exonerating the teacher, the principal refuses to reinstate the teacher and in fact is willing to throw him to the wolves of a school board under pressure to fire him, and that, along with the newspaper editor still publishing stories branding him a pedophile ... the teacher <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">takes his own life</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">The Aesop</a>, then, is that anyone making an accusation this serious better have their facts straight and it better be true, because police will take these accusations seriously.

</li><li> In 1973, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TanyaTucker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TanyaTucker">Tanya Tucker</a> sang about one in "What's Your Mama's Name." In what turns out to be a story of a man trying to search for and reconnect with an ex-girlfriend, the man (named Buford Wilson) travels to Memphis, Tennessee, to search for the woman, but things take an unexpected turn when Wilson meets a green-eyed girl, with whom he suspects he has a connection. After believing the girl may be his daughter, Wilson asks her the title question, about New Orleans (where he and his ex-girlfriend had their previous encounter) and if she knows a man named Buford Wilson. When others witness Wilson offering the girl candy — a nickel's worth, yet! — he is arrested for enticing a child and sentenced to a month in the county jail on hard labor. Wilson's true intentions aren't revealed until the final verse, when years later he — by now a homeless, drunken vagrant — is found dead ... a ragged coat and a faded letter contained within his only possessions. The letter, by the way, is the final clue as to the man's true intentions: "You have a daughter, and her eyes are Wilson green" ... meaning that this wasn't some random, drunken, seedy stranger trying to lure away a little girl to molest. The song became 14-year-old Tucker's first No. 1 hit in May 1973 and set the tone of much of her early material: Gritty, meaty material about adult topics and where the outcome wasn't always positive, her husky voice belying the fact she was just barely into her teenage years.

</li><li> Out of context, the song 'Vehicle' by Ides of March is easily misinterpreted as a song about a paedophile seducing and then abducting a child.

He got the title when he realised his current flirting tactic wasn't working, and he was just being her taxi to modelling school. After the song came out, they had an on-off relationship until they were eventually married.

First, Mr. Garrison upon being arrested for meeting with Cartman blurts out that he doesn't want love from young boys (he slips and states he likes men his own age, before making an unconvincing assertion of heterosexuality). Also, Mephisto admits to being a member of NAMBLA, and tells Cartman he would fit right in.

<ul><li> The Season 6 episode "McStroke" contains an incident that is bizarre but still plays the mistaken impression of pedophilic acts for laughs: Stewie  a 1-year-old who is capable of adult thought and speech  is able to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaperThinDisguise">disguise himself as a high school student</a> for a whole episode.

Stewie gets his revenge on Connie by removing his disguise so that everyone in school, and the police, will see Connie kissing a naked baby.
</li><li> At one point, Stewie also attempts to blackmail Brian by putting nude pictures of himself on Brian's laptop and threatening to pass it to the FBI.
</li><li> An earlier episode has Peter in a job interview when this happens:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Boss</strong>: So where do you see yourself in five years? <br/><strong>Peter</strong>: (<em>thinks</em>) Don't say "doing your wife," don't say "doing your wife"... (<em>aloud</em>) Doing your... <em>(looks at family photo on desk)</em> son?

Cleveland is often mistaken as this because of his close relationship with his son Junior. Not helped that his kid loves to kiss him in public and says suggestive things about him. One particular example occurs when Cleveland is trying to find a friend for Junior. He sees a teenager at a bus stop and instead of bringing Junior to him, he goes himself and tries to get the kid to come back to his car so he can play with "Cleveland Jr." The kid turns out to be an undercover officer and they get him in a sting operation. Later he admits that after reading the transcript, it was an understandable mistake.

Morty claims to Principal Vagina that he "lives on the moon", which the Principal believes to be a euphemism for pedophilia. After being assaulted and fired, Mr. Lunas takes his own life, and morty then realizes the "man on the moon" was just a smidge.

<ul><li> This can, sadly, occur in real life. And it is NEVER funny for anyone involved. Particularly for men who volunteer with children. Ask any man who volunteers with young kids regularly, almost every one of them at some point or another ran into this trope. Best case someone is making a 'joke' about it, but some people will seriously leap to this conclusion. In fact this trope is one of the reasons it's so hard to find males working with kids, as they're afraid of people leaping to conclusions like this. It's rather sad since many children in mentoring programs have no father figure and are desperate for male role models.
<ul><li> During the 80's, there was a hysterical panic that went around about Satanic ritual abuse that was supposedly happening in preschools and day care centers. It's almost certain that nothing of the sort happened and children were interviewed in misleading and coercive ways. The most egregoius case would probably be that of Ray Buckey, who was charged with hundreds of counts of sexual abuse and spent five years in jail before being granted bail. He was cleared of all charges. The trial of his and his co-defendants was the longest and most expensive in California history <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial">and didn't produce a single conviction<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> This can occasionally be an issue for anyone who adopts or fosters children of a different race. Since you're not the same race, 'obviously' you're not the father, so what are you doing giving that kid a hug and kiss!?
</li><li> Or even if you <em>are</em> the biological relative of a child of a different race. A white man (married to a black woman) was recently arrested while merely strolling through the park with his black grand-daughter, having been mistaken for her <em>kidnapper</em> by some busybody who simply couldn't fathom that these two people of different races where in fact related.
</li><li> And due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePedophiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGaysArePedophiles">some discredited stereotypes that just refuse to die</a>, gay men get hit particularly hard by this.
</li></ul></li><li> A survey conducted by the NSPCC (in Britain) found that <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2735350/Two-three-people-admit-hesitate-help-lost-child-fears-falsely-accused.html">64% of those surveyed feared this implication if they were to help a lost child<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, with roughly half of that figure saying they'd approach anyway, and the other half saying they'd stay close by to keep an eye on the kid.
</li><li> This trope is why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntergenerationalFriendship">Intergenerational Friendship</a> is being seen less and less often in media; what was once viewed as an innocent, wholesome relationship <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">is now seen as</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear">the adult "grooming" the child or teenager, in order to make him/her more receptive to sexual advances.</a> Ironically, the situation means it's the adults who are being groomed to actively avoid contact with children.
</li><li> The British "newspaper" News of the World famously published a list of paedophiles which included several completely innocent PAEDIATRICIANS. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/aug/30/childprotection.society">One paediatrician moved after someone sprayed "paedo" on her front porch and door.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Now it's becoming dangerous to even help a sick or injured child.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RoosterTeeth">Rooster Teeth</a>'s RTX '15 convention, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY">RWBY</a></em> team is showing off the poster for Volume 3. Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross want to show the audience the detail on the post, but since they're using Windows' default picture viewer, it's hard to get it just right. The end result: <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyHYO7UtS74">Looking at something you shouldn't<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Though it was obviously a goof, and the accusations were clearly humorous.
<div class="indent"><strong>Lindsay Jones</strong>: [Ruby]'s 15, Miles! She's 15!
</div></li><li> According to a report from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ABC">ABC news</a>, the number of male teachers in the US has dropped by 60% since 1980 because of the assumption that any man who wants to intentionally work with children must be a pedophile. The report cited this attitude as being one of the many causes of the current teacher shortage in America.
</li><li> In June of 2017, <a class="urllink" href="http://ktla.com/2017/06/28/good-samaritan-beaten-called-sexual-predator-after-locating-lost-2-year-old-girl-in-florida/">a story emerged<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where a man was beaten and humiliated online, after asking a number of people if they had lost a two year old girl he was walking with.
</li><li> In November 2013, British singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Steps" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Steps">Ian "H" Watkins</a> was attacked with hate mail on Twitter, accusing him of pedophilia. It turned out that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lostprophets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Lostprophets">a different</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Ian Watkins</a> had recently been convicted of child molestation and possession of pornography.
</li><li> People who suffer from POCD, which is a subset of OCD where an individual suffers from unwanted harmful or sexual thoughts about children, which cause them anxiety, despair and sometimes depression. This is a rare case where people mistake <em>themselves</em> for pedophiles.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LewisCarroll">Lewis Carroll</a> was known to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren">Friend to All Children</a>, and was particularly fond of young girls, who would be the basis of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AliceInWonderland">most famous novels</a>— as a result some scholars hypothesized that he was a pedo/ephebophile. It didn't help that he often took pictures of children in semi-nude poses (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">which was a common artstyle in both film and on canvas at the time</a>), which many scholars understand were simply character studies for inspiration. With the lack of evidence of any wrongdoings or bad behavior, the worst that can be said is that <em>if</em> he was a paedophile, he was able to repress his sexual urges and never act on them.
