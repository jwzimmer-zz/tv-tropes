<div class="indent">— <strong>Algernon Moncrieff</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImportanceOfBeingEarnest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheImportanceOfBeingEarnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>
</div></div><p>A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">contrast</a> between a highly-skilled, perfectionist virtuoso and a less-skilled, but more inventive and original, artist. This is a plot common to stories that focus on the arts (usually music or theater), or sports that require mixing physical ability with creativity (such as dancing or skating).
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Say our protagonist Alice is in a ballet class with another girl named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">Betty</a>. Betty is a dancer's dancer: she's highly respected, her mentors find her a dream to teach, and all the male students are desperate to be her partner. She practices every day, spending hours in front of the mirror ironing out every tiny imperfection. But while she's devoted to her art, she doesn't always seem to <em>enjoy</em> it: she secretly resents losing all her free time to classes; she tends to focus on her mistakes rather than her successes; and every recital is colored by the presence of her domineering <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">Stage Mom</a>.
</p><p>Then there's Alice. She would <em>never</em> get up early for a pre-dawn warmup. She daydreams her way through class. No matter how hard she tries, there is always one move that she can never quite pull off. Nevertheless she loves to dance, and her joy comes out in every performance. Even if she lands flat on her tail, she leaves the audience smiling. She probably has a close group of friends outside the studio, a solid family who cheers no matter what she does, and an optimistic outlook on life. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalierCompetitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CavalierCompetitor">And if dancing</a> ever stops being fun, she'll just stop doing it.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>The dance judges put Betty's number on top every time. Put the pair in front of an audience, however, and it's a different story.
</p><p>The audience doesn't see Betty's perfect form. They see that she dances with a face like a wet weekend. Alice is far more interesting. She turns a pratfall into a quirky dance move, makes faces at the kid in the front row and laughs her way through the final act. Betty may be rolling her eyes from backstage, but she will likely go home wondering why Alice got a standing ovation while all <em>she</em> got was a polite smattering of applause.
</p><p>Betty's "mistake" is that she dances to meet expectations, whether external (imposed by others) or internal (self-imposed), while Alice dances for the sheer joy of the art. The watching audience may not realize what a "perfect performance" is, but they know when the dancers are enjoying themselves... and even those who <em>do</em> know what good form is would rather see originality and artistic interpretation — which Betty often can't do, because improvisation and invention risk the loss of 'perfection'.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni">Red Oni, Blue Oni</a> rivalries where the two are rivals in the same field often feature this with the blue oni as the Technician and the red as the Performer. Since blue types are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LonersAreFreaks">loners or social misfits</a> who put a lot of importance on their one extraordinary ability, having their red counterpart outperform them (even if only in the mind of the audience) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">can lead to some nasty results</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">a breakdown</a>.
</p><p>If they can reconcile, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">Defeat Means Friendship</a> will take hold, and the girls will each learn from each other: Betty will learn to loosen up and rediscover the joy of her art, and Alice will try and emulate Betty's dedication and practice.
</p><p>Obviously, the form that Alice's "originality" manifests itself in will depend on the art/sport she's involved in. She might be an imaginative writer who can't spell, or a painter of simplistic, cheerful paintings in an art school full of students obsessed with complexity. She may be the ice skater who zooms around the ice happily, but can't quite pull off that tricky spin, or a musician that finds sheet music boring and likes to jazz them up with their own variations (with varying degrees of success). Whatever the scenario, the individuality that makes her "imperfect" is the same individuality that endears her to anyone watching.
</p><p>Generally, the narrative will be in favour of the enthusiastic performer (who sometimes has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">The Gift</a>, but not always) rather than the diligent technician. At its best, the trope sings the praises of enjoying yourself and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">being unique</a>; at its worst, it implies that superior skill hamstrings individuality.
</p><p>Differs slightly from (but is related to) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a>. In this trope, there is no denying that the Technician is usually <em>better</em> at what they do, but the Performer is more fun to watch, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a> adds insult to injury by giving a cheerful slacker superior <em>skill</em> than those around them who actually practice. Also similar to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">Weak, but Skilled</a>; similar in that there is a better trained performer against a stronger or more talented rival, but different in that the one with the best training wins, usually through cleverness and skill.
</p><p>A character who is both technician <em>and</em> performer may overlap with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalentedButTrained" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalentedButTrained">Talented, but Trained</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGift">innate talent</a> + hard work).
</p><p>Contrast the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainyFreeVillain">Villainy-Free Villain</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingSportsTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingSportsTeam">Opposing Sports Team</a>. Could also be seen as a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnobsVsSlobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnobsVsSlobs">Snobs Vs Slobs</a>, with fastidious technicians who pay attention to detail as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foil">foil</a> for performers who believe in doing what comes naturally.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Anime &amp; Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleAngelAlita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleAngelAlita">Battle Angel Alita</a></em>: Discussed when Alita plays motorball; she's a skilled fighter and wins a lot of races, but (she is told) she doesn't belong with the true motorballers, who value causing spectacle and drawing in audiences above winning or even surviving.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleRoyale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BattleRoyale">Battle Royale</a></em>:
<ul><li> This trope is brought up in the manga, when the character Toshinori Oda remembers the time that he and the protagonist, Shuya, performed music for the class; Oda's reserved violin recital received only polite applause, while Shuya's over-the-top guitar playing had the whole class cheering for him. Oda sees this as proof that his classmates are "uncultured"; Kazuo later thinks to himself (after killing Oda) that it was because Oda was too arrogant and "put himself between the listener and the music".
</li><li> Also when Kazuo fights against Hiroki. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Hiroki</a> is fighting with passion to save <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">a girl</a>, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">Kazuo</a> simply fights with pure skill with no motivation, or drive.
</li></ul></li><li> Used beautifully in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BECK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BECK">Beck</a></em>: In the "Grateful Sound" arc, the band breaks up thanks to internal tensions set off by Ryuske's Deal with the Devil. The rival band, Bell Ame, is set to totally eclipse BECK's set. Refusing to back down, Koyuki, followed by Saku on drums, grabs a acoustic and plays a stunning and spirited cover of <strike>the Beatles's "I've Got a Feeling"</strike> in-universe band The Dying Breed's song "Fifty Cent Wisdom". The result? The factory-produced sugar-pop rival's set actually bleeds off its audience!
<ul><li> Belle Ame aren't helped by the fact that their special guest, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bishounen">bishounen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera">soup star</a> (and love rival of Kouyuki) they have performing with them can't actually sing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BNABrandNewAnimal">BNA: Brand New Animal</a></em>: When it comes to shapeshifting, Michiru is a Performer good at developing new forms on the fly and seemingly without thinking; while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nazuna</span> is a Technician with only a few forms that she's practiced and refined. One of the more notable examples being their flight forms: Her first time using the form Michiru fell off a tall building and shifted into a bird without even noticing until Shirou pointed it out, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Nazuna</span> grows angel-looking wings out of her shoulders <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and revealed them in a staged performance.</span>
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaptainTsubasa">Captain Tsubasa</a></em>, Hyuga Koujirou is a Performer who uses raw power and hot blood as he plays, whereas Ohzora Tsubasa is a devoted Technician who focuses on his skills. They clash as a result, but later Hyuga finds himself landing in trouble when he plays abroad and sees that his Performer traits are a hindrance on his playing style...
<ul><li> It could be argued that Hyuga is the technician and Tsubasa the performer in the sense that Hyuga only plays to be the best, to get noticed so to land a contract in a major club to provide his family with money, and spends countless hours in training from hell while Tsubasa plays mainly for fun, is enthusiastic and charismatic enough to have everyone behind him and seems innately gifted.
</li><li> Tsubasa as a performer (albeit a very talented one) pit against technicians happens on a regular basis. It starts with Wakabayashi in their first encounter (thus beating the best goal keeper of all Japan for whom soccer was serious business), Misugi, Hyuga and later Santana.
<ul><li> For example, we have Tsubasa and Carlos Santana in Brazil, with Tsubasa being the performer and Santana the technician. The latter is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedBaron">called the "Soccer God's son" but also the "Soccer Cyborg"</a>, playing soccer at perfection but with no soul anymore <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> involving a huge dose of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">Break the Cutie</a></span>. On the other hand there is Tsubasa, who always considered the soccer ball as his friend and is playing for fun. Even though Santana is clearly superior to Tsubasa, being able to even reproduce perfectly and actually improve on the way Tsubasa just scored a goal to try to humiliate him, in the end it's Tsubasa who wins the duel <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gimr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gimr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gimr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(matches in the show usually rely mainly on two men with the rest of the team being near to useless unless the plot requires it)</span> through his creativity and "I'll never quit" attitude, because it is too much fun to give one's best 'til the end for him. When they meet again much later, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Santana's</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">emotional damage has begun to mend</a>, and thus while he's still mostly a technician, he has dropped a part of his arrogance and plays both to enjoying himself <em>and</em> to win.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: In battle, Lelouch is the Technician to Suzaku's Performer. Lelouch is a calculating tactician who is much better suited at outwitting his enemies than taking them head-on, and the only time he can match experienced pilots in a fight with a Knightmare Frame is with a Knightmare that has an unusual control mechanism that he allows him to take advantage of his intellect. In comparison, Suzaku is no leader and a much more gifted pilot and combatant, attacking head-on and using risky maneuvers to overcome his foes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>: In a way Vegeta is the Technician to Goku's performer. Vegeta trains and fights to be the strongest fighter in the universe, he also never spars, pushes himself waaaay too hard and his pride won't allow him to ask for help. Goku trains and fights because he loves it and is willing to learn from and train with others. In the end Goku is the better fighter because he is more open to learning from others.
<ul><li> A better example may be Piccolo (post <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> anyway) and Goku... Or, frankly, anyone else in the series that isn't a normal little human. While preternaturally strong, he usually ends up registering about a 7 or 8 while others spike at 10-15. But he's just so damn <em>good</em> and knows so many techniques (when it doesn't just come down to a planet-busting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeamOWar">Beam-O-War</a>) that he can hold his own with the best of them. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">Unless he's the one that gets picked on to prove "how much a threat" the new villain is.</a>
</li><li> The best example, however, has to be Tien. Serious, introducing new and effective techniques every time he gets to fight, and, despite becoming unable to catch up in the arc following his introduction, he just doesn't stop training. When a mere human manages to hold Cell in place, or deflect one of Super Buu's attacks, you know his technique just doesn't compare.
</li></ul></li><li> Briefly mentioned in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>, where Winry and Cheska debate over whether cooking is a science or an art.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GirlsUndPanzer">Girls und Panzer</a></em> encapsulates the divide with the Nishizumi sisters: Miho simply wants to enjoy Tankery matches as fun sporting events (Performer), while Maho has adopted her family's ethos of using traditional battle tactics to win at all costs (Technician). When they finally face off on opposite sides, it's a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DavidVersusGoliath">David vs. Goliath</a> match where Miho's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits">Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits</a> are outgunned in a straight fight, but Maho's tanks suffer from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">Crippling Overspecialization</a>, where their practiced formations can't adapt to unorthodox tactics and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GlassMask">Glass Mask</a></em> has heroine Maya Kitajima as a Performer who pours her soul and spirit when she acts, with her rival Ayumi Himekawa as a practically perfect Technician. Lampshaded when Maya says she envies Ayumi's technical skills and grace, but Ayumi thinks Maya can reach emotional depths that she simply <em>never</em> will equal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IronWokJan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IronWokJan">Iron Wok Jan</a></em> twists this trope with Kiriko Gobancho and Jan Akiyama. Jan, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, is an inverted Performer in that he cooks to deliberately earn the hatred and disgust of the audience — to make the victory of his cuisine all the sweeter. And yet he admits that he cooks mostly because it's all that his grandfather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">taught him how to do</a> before dying, and mostly seems to feel a professional pride about what he went through hell to learn. Kiriko's ideals are that "cooking is about heart"; although she's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirToTheDojo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirToTheDojo">Heir to the Dojo</a>, she only became a cook because she wanted to, she taught herself most of what she knows, and she always tries to keep the customers and their desires in mind when she cooks. However, she is definitely a much more deliberate, no-nonsense chef than Jan. The two are both portrayed as equals in skill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure</a></em> has this dynamic with its many characters, some of which change roles throughout the series as well. To name some examples:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">Phantom Blood</a></em>, Jonathan is the performer to Dio's technician. Dio is a highly calculating villain who uses guile and pragmatism to gain an edge, while Jonathan is a quick thinker who uses creative solutions to overcome his opponents.
</li><li> Joseph, the hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">Battle Tendency</a></em>, is even more of a performer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrastingSequelMainCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrastingSequelMainCharacter">compared to Jonathan</a>, as well as compared to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlyRival">Friendly Rival</a> Caesar. What Joseph lacks in training, he more than makes up for in creative applications of Hamon, as well as unorthodox abilities conceived to throw his opponents off and give himself the advantage.
</li><li> Jotaro, the hero of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventure">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, is more of a technician than Joseph or Jonathan, possessing a keen intellect that allows him to dismantle his opponents' advantages. DIO, meanwhile, has become more of a performer, using The World to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeStandsStill">halt time</a> as a means of both giving himself a nigh-immutable advantage in combat and messing with his enemies' heads.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is the biggest difference between Kaguya and Shirogane in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleOfWits">Battle of Wits</a>. Kaguya is a schemer who tends to come up with her plans ahead of time and favors being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a>, while Shirogane tends to prefer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">Indy Ploys</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They end up swapping roles when they finally admit their feelings to one another, with Shirogane spending weeks planning out a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandRomanticGesture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandRomanticGesture">Grand Romantic Gesture</a> and Kaguya spontaneously initiating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">The Big Damn Kiss</a>.</span>
</li><li> This also comes up when Kaguya and Fujiwara both try to help Shirogane learn a dance for the sports festival. Kaguya has him go through the motions and memorize the proper moves, while Fujiwara tells him he has to understand the feeling of being pulled.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1m91x');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1m91x" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1m91x');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The dance in question was inspired by fishermen, and the move he was having difficulty pulling off was based on pulling in fishing nets.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KaleidoStar">Kaleido Star</a></em>: Sora is the Performer; Leon and May are mainly Technicians. Layla, however, has both traits despite her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Defrosting Ice Queen</a> persona. Marion lampshades this when she comments on Sora's incompetence as part of the reason she's such a crowd pleaser: knowing that she might screw up keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Unlike Leon (too racked with guilt and angst to enjoy what he does) and May (too intent on winning to care about the audience), Sora loves her job and plays to the crowd... and sometimes too hard.
<ul><li> Heavily lampshaded later, when Katie chewed Leon and May out during the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></em> rehearsals. She basically tells them "A selfish Romeo who only cares about his own splendor? A cowardly Juliet who seems scared and diminished? Don't make me laugh you guys, you epically SUCK!"
</li><li> Of note: a good part of May's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> comes from her training to become more of a Performer, dropping the flaws that her Technician side brings her. This offers parallels with her going from a self-absorbed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> to a more selfless but still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a>.
</li><li> Don't forget Rosetta versus Sora early in season one. Rosetta starts as a stellar technician whose act looks like a "Diavolo machine". According to Kalos, she looks so cold and mechanical when performing, that the audience gets bored despite all the skill she develops; therefore, he teams her up with Sora so Rosetta can learn how to enjoy herself more so she'll win the audience's love. When she <em>does</em> becomes more of a performer thanks to Sora's help, he lampshades this by saying "Rosetta has finally become a performer".
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> has Ryuko as the performer and Satsuki as the technician. Ryuko is accustomed to street fighting and has little experience with using her Scissor Blade, so she relies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IndyPloy">quick thinking</a> in conjunction with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdaptiveArmor">Senketsu's ever-increasing arsenal of powers</a> to win fights. Satsuki on the other hand has been training with a katana since childhood and doesn't have any abilities on Junketsu that are unique to it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeakButSkilled">relying on her insane skill to keep up with the power creep in later episodes</a>.

Kouji is the Technician, who uses his weapons in a normal way -such as Mazinger's Photon-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeBeam">Eye Beam</a> as a long range weapon-, combining them with pure brute force and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism">Combat Pragmatism</a>. Tetsuya is the performer who combines his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatism">Combat Pragmatism</a> by using Great's wide arsenal of weapons in an unorthodox way -such as shooting Thunder Break with both weapons or using it to turning his swords into Lightning rods, his surprisingly weird way of handling swords, or covering Great with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChestBlaster">Breast Burn</a> heat energy (a movement which later would be adapted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsAlpha">Super Robot Wars Alpha</a></em> and turned into <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Mazinkaiser">Mazinkaisers</a></em> Kaiser Nova).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia">My Hero Academia</a>:</em>
<ul><li> Izuku Midoriya and All Might
<ul><li> A teacher-and-student variation exists between the protagonist Izuku Midoriya and his mentor, the number one hero All Might, who trains him in the use of their shared quirk, One For All. All Might is a performer. From the day of his heroic debut, saving people while laughing in the face of disaster and proclaiming everything will be all right now because <em>he</em> is there, All Might has inspired confidence and admiration over his career. Midoriya, meanwhile, is a technician. He's quiet, has taken notes on heroes since he could write and tends to impress people on a much more individual level. All Might's mentoring of Midoriya is hampered by this fact, as All Might took to One For All much more naturally than Midoriya has, yet fails to realize his student <em>isn't</em> as intuitive as he was. His teachings are less informative than they should be as a result.
</li><li> The contrast is further shown in how All Might's teacher, Gran Torino, approaches them. He taught All Might by basically subjecting him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> and beating the crap out of him to the point the number one hero trembles in fear of the old man years later. He deals with Midoriya by giving him a few choice pieces of advice, letting the boy work out the answers on his own, <em>then</em> beating the crap out of him to give Midoriya a chance to test what he's come up with. Midoriya makes much more progress controlling One For All in a week with Gran Torino than he had in a significantly longer period with All Might.
</li></ul></li><li> Izuku Midoriya and Katsuki Bakugo
<ul><li> Midoriya shares this contrast with his childhood friend and bully, Katsuki Bakugo. Midoriya is timid, thoughtful, and has to constantly put in the work to catch up to his peers in using his powers. Bakugo is a hothead driven to surpass his peers who prefers to rush in headfirst and is a more naturally gifted fighter. Where Midoriya sees being a hero as cool because they help people, Bakugo sees being a hero as cool because heroes always win. The differences between them are highlighted as early as the U.A. Entrance Exam. Bakugo passes the practical exam exclusively by destroying robot adversaries for points. Midoriya makes it through exclusively by passing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a>, fighting a powerful foe worth zero points to save a student who got trapped in its warpath.
</li><li> In the Provisional License Exam, in which the students are tested for the right for licenses that let them act as heroes in limited situations, the second phase is a simulated rescue mission which involves a combination of fighting off villains and rescuing survivors. Bakugo's tunnel-vision on the surface-level, action oriented side of heroing bites him hard, as he's excessively rude to the people he's supposed to be saving even as he's making appropriate calls on whether to help them or send them to aid stations. Midoriya, despite some initial stumbling, is much more well-rounded and handles both the rescue side and a simulated villain attack much better. This results in Bakugo being one of only two members of the class <em>not</em> to pass the exam. Later, All Might tells both of them that a mix of Technician and Performer is ideal, and that Bakugo was held back by being too focused on the surface fame of being a hero, while Midoriya is too focused on the nuts and bolts and tends to be less driven and ambitious.
</li></ul></li><li> For all that Midoriya is the technician when placed beside the inspirational All Might and attention-grabbing Bakugo, the dynamic flips when Midoriya is compared to Tenya Iida. Midoriya's natural willingness to jump into danger to help others and relative recklessness contrast sharply to Ida's by-the-book, prone to overthinking attitude. In the U.A. Entrance Exam, Ida focuses on performing the test following the rules laid out to them beforehand. The idea of attacking the giant, zero-point robot never occurs to him for a moment and only seeing Midoriya do so to save someone else makes him stop and consider that there even <em>is</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">Secret Test of Character</a> involved. As the two become friends, Midoriya's natural heroism helps inspire Ida while Ida's adversity to recklessness has helped to keep Midoriya in check.
</li><li> The Joint Training Arc highlights this dynamic between Classes 1-A and 1-B. Class 1-A are the performers, who have caught the eyes of many Pro Heroes for internships, become stars during the Sports Festival, and regularly thrive in high-pressure, chaotic situations like the villain attacks during USJ and the summer training camp with quick thinking and resolve. Class 1-B are the technicians, as they have had relatively stable classes throughout the semesters, make good use of teamwork, forethought and planning, and regularly thrive in more organized assessments like U.A's final exam or the provisional license exam.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/NodameCantabile">Nodame Cantabile</a></em> initially seems to set up this kind of conflict between uptight perfectionist Chiaki and quirky free spirit Nodame, particularly when their mentor Stresemann criticizes Chiaki's performance of Rachmanioff for lacking "sexiness." The conflict never materializes, however; Chiaki, despite his more technician-like approach to his art, regularly stuns audiences with the quality of his performances, and his technical skill is accompanied by a genuine love of and passion for music. Meanwhile, although Nodame also loves music and has a natural talent which Chiaki recognizes immediately, the fact that she takes it much less seriously and lacks Chiaki's drive proves to be a problem which hinders her performances.
<ul><li> The trope is deconstructed in <em>Nodame Cantabile</em>, in that neither pure technician nor pure performer is right or better for classical music. A classical musician should have the mix of both. It is also implied that there is no right mix either. Chiaki and Kuroki are more towards the technician part, while Nodame and Jean Donnadieu are more towards the performer part. All of them are celebrated, but just in different ways, and it's difficult to say who is better.
</li></ul></li><li> Luffy and Zoro from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> qualify. Luffy (the Performer) does next to no training for his techniques, and has an impressive fighting sense gained from training with his grandfather and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> brothers</span> at an early age. It's even stated in-series that his only trained move is his Gomu Gomu no Pistol, everything else he just creates on the spot. Zoro (the Technician) however is seen doing training most of the time he's at sea (when he's not sleeping or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">being antagonized by Nami</a>). His techniques weren't thought up as quickly, as he takes time to create them and polish them to make them stronger (though usually it's off screen when he does) and techniques like Oni Giri were made from his efforts, it also helps that he uses a fictional style that he made of his own volition. Comparatively, they are almost equal in terms of strength and combat ability with Luffy being slightly stronger than Zoro.
<ul><li> Zoro's fight against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcVillain">Buggy's</a> second mate, Cabaji The Acrobat, puts a notable emphasis on this. Cabaji, along with his swordsmanship skills, uses a variety of circus tricks against Zoro such as firebreathing and spinning tops as well as fighting Zoro while riding on top of a unicycle as opposed to Zoro who simply uses his skills as a swordsman against Cabaji. Zoro struggled with Cabaji's tricks at first, not helped with the wound he got when fighting Buggy prior, but when he managed to knock Cabaji off his unicycle and forced Cabaji to fight him without any tricks, Zoro defeats him with a single attack.
</li></ul></li><li> Duck/Ahiru, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, is so inherently clumsy that not even her passion for ballet can land her a leading role, but her performance does inspire a melancholy yet brilliant ballerina to find her own style rather than mimicking others. Of course, her counterpart is Rue, who though technically skilled, finds that she is lacking something..
</li><li> Played in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkipBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SkipBeat">Skip Beat!</a></em> with Kyoko and Kanae. While in the beginning it seemed that both were going to develop a Performer/Technician rivalry, soon it's revealed that Kanae, while more of a Technician actress than Kyoko, is able to pull Performer-like stunts when needed... and for a while, is <em>Kanae</em> who loves more her selected career (Kyoko was there more for the fame-making potential she needed for her revenge, until she grows). Besides, <em>both</em> girls are in the Love Me team, a division for people who, while very talented, still lacks a certain quality who drives the public to likes them.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SmileDownTheRunway">Smile Down The Runway</a></em>. There are basically two types of fashion: i.e. "high-fashion" (technician) that has high artistic merit and eccentric designs that would require advanced techniques to pull off, and "commercial fashion" (performer) that appeals to masses. During the Geika Institute Fashion Festival, the entries are ranked based on the former, but the headmaster reminds the audience that there is really no ranks in fashion, and that the judges' rankings should not invalidate the customer's emotional experience with their favoured collections. As if to drive the point forward, the judges agree that Ayano Toh is the no. 1 contestant, as his collection showcased the highest level of artistic expression, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist">Ikuto</a> is placed 11th since his designs are too "commercial". However, Ikuto is also the only other student aside from Ayano to attract buyers, meaning that 9 others who were ranked higher than him failed to connect to the audience.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Swan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Swan">Swan</a></em> manga takes a different approach to this - heroine Masumi's originality and enthusiasm take her a long way, true...but it doesn't always triumph against her rivals, who often have superior skill on <em>top</em> of originality.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">many many episodes of</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> did this a few times, once with two rival restaurants, owned by sisters, one where the chef was a Mr. Mime and the other where the chef was a Sneasel. The Mr. Mime cook put a lot of flash into his cooking, turning even the cooking itself into a performance of sorts with his psychic abilities, and the presentation of the meal could not have been nicer...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethalChef">but the food itself was virtually inedible, as the flavor was nightmarish</a>. The Sneasel, by comparison, was an unimpressive minimalist, cooking in the backroom and bringing out extremely ordinary-looking, even ugly-looking dishes...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupremeChef">that turned out to be mouthgasmically delicious</a>. While Ash and his friends helped out Mr. Mime by teaching which flavors work best and to take it a bit slower, <em>Team Rocket</em> helps out the Sneasel in being a bit more flashy with presentation. After a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel">Cooking Duel</a> and stopping Team Rocket, the two sisters made up and combined their places into one.
<ul><li> This also happens a lot with Ash in Pokemon battles. Ash is a Performer whose Pokemon are strong because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerOfLove">Power of Love</a>, and often gets paired up with Technician opponents who go for type advantages and such and aren't as inspiring to their Pokemon.
<ul><li> Ash does have a certain amount of Technician, especially in Sinnoh (taking Dawn's Spin Dodge and Ice Aqua Jet ideas, meant for contests, and turning them into valid Battle techniques, for example), though how much strategy he'll get to use varies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a>.
</li><li> The dichotomy shows in Froakie &amp; Hawlucha's Doubles match against Clemont's Bunnelby &amp; Chespin. Froakie takes the match seriously, while Hawlucha wants to make it a performance. Neither thinks much of the other's method.
</li></ul></li><li> One other episode features a Hitmontop trainer who relies too much on being a Performer and has to tone it down and balance it with being a Technician. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun">Yes</a>, Hitmontop is one of several mons that <em>can</em> have Technician as an ability.
</li><li> Being a Co-ordinator requires a higher amount of Performer than being a regular Trainer, as points are lost if either your performance isn't flashy enough or your opponent's performance is flashier. Ash once tried a contest on a suggestion, leading to a matchup against Zoey. Zoey ends up winning by virtue of having more points, but just because time ran out before Ash's Pokemon could land a difinitive knockout hit. She admits if it weren't for the time limit, she would have lost.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline">Sword Art Online</a></em> has this dynamic with two antagonists, Akihiko Kayaba and Nobuyuki Sugou. Kayaba is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadArtist">Mad Artist</a> at his core, and used groundbreaking virtual technology to force thousands of people to live inside his video game, Sword Art Online. Sugou, on the other hand, uses ALFheim Online to perform human experimentation and harvest data.
</li><li> Lampshaded by Aster/Edo Phoenix (a professional duelist, the performer) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuGiOhGX">Yu-Gi-Oh! GX</a></em> during his duel against Jaden/Judai; he states that everyone can win a duel, but he's a professional, and his task is to grasp victory while giving his audience a good show, cue to him feigning to have taken game-ending damage only to make a powerful comeback and winning just after that.
</li><li> Yusei Fudo and Jack Atlas of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds">Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's</a></em> fit this trope perfectly, at first glance. Whilst Yusei is a master of gadgetry and engineering and calm and calculated as a result, Jack on the other hand appears to have no technical skill but is a hugely talented entertainer, preferring big and flashy plays to several smaller tactical ones like Yusei. Despite this, his only two loses capable of being chalked up to overconfidence in the first case and an obsessive desire to defeat Yusei by conquering the card combo he lost to in their last match during their rematch. What makes this more debatable, is that Jack sticks to tried and true methods, whereas Yusei will try new things and tends to be more creative.
</li><li> Is a major part of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhArcV">Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</a></em>, since Yuya is training specifically to be an entertainment duelist; a fictional branch of pro-duelists whose goal is to entertain the audience instead of winning. Lots of duels are between technicians and performers, with varying results. Becomes a crucial part of Yuya's character, since Yuya sometimes tries to be the performer in situations where it's completely inappropriate and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">has an emotional breakdown when he's repeatedly forced to duel as a technician instead of a performer</a></span>.
<ul><li> During the MCS qualifying duels, this trope is how Yuya wins and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorTherapist">gets through to</a> Kyuuando and Michio; both are technicians who <em>think</em> they're performers, and Yuya's performance shows them how to become a real performer.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bakuman">Bakuman。</a></em> has an interesting version of this, making the Technician(s) the protagonist, yet also putting both sides on equal ground. The main characters, Takagi and Mashiro, are clearly the technicians, being praised for their calculating intelligence and technical skill at writing manga together, yet get bogged when trying to write something mainstream because they can't come up with an exceptionally interesting premise. Their main rival, Niizuma Eiji is presented as a natural genius who simply draws whatever he feels like and cranks out hits, yet is also criticized for the lack of depth in his work. Then it turns out that the Performer is a totally fanboy of the Technicians' work, and later on both parties end up improving from the influence of the other.
<ul><li> The trope is still mostly played straight, since Eiji's work (especially Crow) consistently outperforms every other named character's manga, including the main pair's. But they're much closer to Eiji's level than most instances of this trope.
<ul><li> Lately in manga Eiji also came closer to Technician side, especially with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his new series, "Zombie Gun"</span>, that is far more plotted than previous.
</li><li> Possibly justified, as despite acting like a performer, Eiji had much more practice drawing manga than his peers by virtue of not having anything else to do as a child.
</li></ul></li><li> A straighter example would be Hiramaru compared to any of the others characters. while they all have a passion for manga and have been improving their skills for a few years, Hiramaru had no experience drawing, or even reading manga. He took one glimpse at a recent issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/ShonenJump">Shonen Jump</a></em>, learned a few tricks and decided he could try it. His first chapters got better rankings than thoses of Ashirogi, who debuted in Jump around the same time, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his first manga lasted longer than thoses of the main characters or the other rivals, except Niizuma.</span> Not only that but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he was also the first to get his manga adapted into a anime aside from Niizuma (who had already been serialized for three years when Hiramaru debuted) </span>.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FushigiBoshiNoFutagoHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FushigiBoshiNoFutagoHime">Fushigi Boshi No Futago Hime</a></em> illustrates this trope using Altezza, who practiced hard before each Princess Party, but had yet to win one, thanks to interference from the main characters' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Girl</a> powers. When the twins found out how hard she worked, they got depressed about their own laid-back, "just have fun" approach to the parties and being princesses in general. Bright, Altezza's older brother, tells the girls that they have something Altezza doesn't, but is cut off before he can tell them what it is.
</li><li> This is oddly inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheCherryProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheCherryProject">The Cherry Project</a></em>, a pre-<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokoTakeuchi">Naoko Takeuchi</a> manga. The protagonist and newcomer figure skater Chieri learns everything she knows by copying others' technical moves, but doesn't have the "artistic grace" that semi-pro Canty has.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PianoNoMori" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PianoNoMori">Piano no Mori</a></em> exemplifies this trope in the relation between friends and competing pianists Shuhei (the technician) and Kai (the performer).
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HikaruNoGo">Hikaru no Go</a></em>, with Hikaru (Performer) and Akira (Technician). The twist is that while Akira thinks Hikaru is good enough to play at his level from the start, that's actually not true, and it takes Hikaru years to reach a level where he can compete with him. Even then <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Akira is always seen as the better Go player, and Hikaru never beats him, though he comes close.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutureGPXCyberFormula">Future GPX Cyber Formula</a></em> has Hayato Kazami (performer) and Naoki Shinjyo (technician). While Hayato races with the help of an AI computer, Shinjyo has been racing for years. In the latter half of the TV series, Randoll plays the technician to Hayato's performer. Asuka lampshades this when she has a conversation with him.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LittleWitchAcademia2017">Little Witch Academia (2017)</a></em> Diana Cavendish and Akko Kagari are the Technician and Performer, respectively. Diana comes from a long, well known, powerful family. At a Festival in episode 13, she pulls off a powerful summoning, copying parts of the performance of Shiny Chariot, an entertainer witch from a decade ago. Her skill wows the crowd. But Akko, who has very little skill (she's only been using magc for maybe a couple months at this point) and can't do anything well, but wants magic to be <em>fun</em>, puts on a dazzling performance, using her inability to do things perfectly to instead make silly shapeshifts, eliciting laughs from everyone, even those who comment in just how bad her shapeshifting skill is, and wins the crowd. Diana's performance, while technically perfect, is sterile and cold in comparison.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Macross">Macross</a></em>:

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em> features Hayate as the performer and Mirage as the technician; their squadron's ace actually criticizes both of them for going too far on their respective ends of the spectrum, since his own piloting is a near-perfect mix of both styles.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SamuraiChamploo">Samurai Champloo</a></em> features Mugen the performer, and Jin the technician. Mugen's style is entirely self-taught, and relies on creativity and unpredictability, while Jin's style is disciplined, relying on traditional moves. Played with a bit as Mugen and Jin both learn from each other. Most evident in their respective final fights.
<ul><li> Mugen, after easily being defeated by Kariya for "relying on his instincts too much", logically works out how to beat Umanosuke's unique weapon, overcoming his weakness of never really thinking about how to fight an opponent.
</li><li> Likewise, Jin overcomes Kariya (who had, at this point, easily beaten Mugen and Jin in a 2-on-1 battle) by abandoning the orthodox style Kariya was better at, and using a highly unorthodox (suicidal) technique to fell him.

</li><li> The partnership between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Keet">Eiji Kikumaru</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Shuuichiro Oishi</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em> is this through and through. Eiji is the Performer: crowd-pleasing, flashy, acrobatic, charismatic. Meanwhile, Oishi is the Technician: reliable, methodical, rational, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervesOfSteel">Nerves of Steel</a>. Lampshaded in the manga where, in their first year, Eiji challenged Oishi to a duel since he thought he was a boring player... and was curb stomped <em>thrice</em>, thus deciding to become his partner instead. It's also seen the Hyoutei matches: when Eiji has to team up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Momoshirou</a> due to Oishi being injured, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">in such an emotional turmoil</a> since they've never played without each other that it takes him a while to recover his spirits and be able to synch better with Momoshirou.
<ul><li> Actually, almost all partnerships have elements of this (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesnickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSeriesnickname">the Golden Pair</a> is the most blatant example). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">Sanada</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Atobe</a> are good examples as well: Sanada is the Technician through and through, Atobe is both Performer <em>and</em> Technician, and it takes them a while to work well together.
</li></ul></li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CandyCandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CandyCandy">Candy Candy</a></em>'s Hospital arc. Candy, Frannie and the other prospect nurses are discussing nursing techniques and behavior towards patients: Candy shows Performer traits as she believes that you gotta approach the patients and help them feel good, while Frannie goes Technician and points out that the most popular nurse isn't automatically the best one and that they must be pragmatic as well.
</li><li> Rei Ryugazaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em> has the demeanor of a Technician, but has an appreciation for the aesthetic values of a Performer, which he wishes to incorporate into his style. He joins the swim club primarily because he sees just how much of the Performer is in them (especially Haruka), and hopes he can learn from them.
</li><li> As with many tropes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperRobot">Super Robot</a> genre, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> provides a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> of the usual use: Amuro (Performer) is incredibly talented but, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallingIntoTheCockpit">having had to jump in the Gundam with the piloting manual and no prior training</a>, has little experience piloting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">mobile suit</a>, while the Zeon aces he has to face are <em>all</em> militarily trained and experienced war veterans who know their machines inside-out. As a result, Amuro survived Char's initial onslaught with a Zaku and defeated Ramba Ral's Gouf only thanks to the superior performance of the Gundam, and is only by learning the technique through hard training and battles that, by the time the Three Black Stars (less skilled than either Char or Ramba Ral) show up, he's a legitimately good pilot. After that, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Reconstruction">Reconstructs</a> it: the Three Black Stars are <em>still</em> more skilled than Amuro, but aren't as versatile as him and last only two fights before being killed off, with one of them getting unceremoniously killed when Amuro dismantled their trademark maneuver.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> plays this trope both ways: as long as there's even a chance of a fight being anywhere close to even, neither natural strength nor self-taught ability NOR extensive skill training has a natural advantage. Some of the best examples of this are any time Naruto (the Performer) wins a fight through making up moves on the fly and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">sheer hard-headedness</a>, or the victories Shikamaru (the Technician) accrues through strategy and his mastery of shadow-manipulation binding techniques. There are plenty of speeches about "ability versus technique" going in both directions, both with their merits. There are also plenty of instances where "unbeatable techniques" or "unstoppable raw power" both come to the forefront, especially as the Tailed Beasts come to the fore and need to be dealt with/are needed to deal with the problems at hand.
<ul><li> Surprisingly enough, Naruto changes roles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheLastNarutoTheMovie">The Last</a></em>, which comes to view in his final battle with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Toneri Otsutsuki</a>. Toneri's newly acquired Tenseigan gives him access to a lot of flashy and destructive jutsu, and is more or less evenly matched with Naruto in terms of raw power. On the other thand, while not lacking on the flashy himself, Naruto makes use of the skills he acquired from years of fighting experience along with his strength and determination, and Toneri's newly acquired abilities couldn't match up to the more battle-hardened Naruto. Case in point: Toneri's BFS lazer gets defeated by a fairly basic move <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">(a chakra imbued fist).</a>
</li></ul></li><li> An ongoing theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>. Interestingly, the manga doesn't come out on a specific side, instead stating that it's necessary to be able to do both. Individual characters are all over the spectrum, from Alice Nakiri who is so obsessed with incorporating cutting-edge techniques she loses sight of the task at hand, to Megumi Tadokoro who always cooks with great care and attention, but has trouble with execution due to lacking technical skills. A particularly vile version of the Technician is Mimasaka Subaru, who is an excellent cook, but only cares about winning cooking competitions. He doesn't care about cooking good food, about pleasing diners, about respecting the skills, privacy and propery of others, and his entire schtick is based around stealing his competitors' recipes and improving on them just enough to make sure he wins.
</li><li> The two main characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YourLieInApril">Your Lie in April</a></em> are this when it comes to music. Kousei is the technician, since his mother drilled into him that he must always stick to the score and memorize it inside and out, while Kaori is the performer whose wild and energetic playing greatly deviates from the sheet music.
<ul><li> This also plays a major role in the series itself, as the Performance side is the one always advocated for, as it has the greatest potential to reach others <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsvsStoicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsvsStoicism">on an emotional level</a>. This is exemplified in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesEstablishingMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriesEstablishingMoment">the second episode</a>, in which the Head Judge marks Kaori off for deviating from the piece as-written, but the audience <em>loves</em> it, giving her a standing ovation.

The two of them have been compared a few times and at least once by Karma himself. Karma, the Performer, is faster, stronger and more skilled than Nagisa but is too much of a showboat to be a proper assassin. Nagisa, the Technician, is quiet, looks harmless and is frequently mistaken for a girl but is capable of killing casually, is very level-headed and appears nonthreatening until he's already struck.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullMoon">Full Moon</a></em> Madoka Wakamatsu is the Technician as a more experienced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdolSinger">Idol Singer</a> with skills that don't come from other sources, while Mitsuki/Fullmoon is the Performer as a prospect singer who has magical help and sings with her heart. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> It becomes quite important later since Madoka is told that her songs are good but have no soul, causing her to almost quit music altogether.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuriOnIce">Yuri!!! on Ice</a></em> explores this in several figure skaters — overall, it takes the view that both elements are crucial in succeeding as a skater:
<ul><li> Yuri Katsuki's ballet teacher, Minako, tells Victor that Yuri is no genius, and that his skill and success are down to constant practice and the luxury of having a nearby ice rink that was willing to let him practice alone. Yuri himself echoes this sentiment. This would seem to put Yuri firmly in Technician territory...but the narrative strongly suggests that Minako is simply <em>wrong:</em> Yuri <em>does</em> have natural talent and very strong Performer elements. Victor picks up on this immediately, telling Yuri that his ability to "make music with his body" is what immediately drew Victor to him (well, that and the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">drunken pole-dancing antics</span>). Yuri Plisetsky too, remembers Yuri K for his elegant step sequences. In fact, it's <em>technical</em> skills (especially the jumps) that are the bane of Yuri's life, while his <em>performance</em> elements boost his score.
</li><li> Victor, the in-universe star of the ice, is best know for being a Performer — in and out of the rink. He's a showman, he flirts with the cameras, and his programs are clearly designed to tell a story. His priority is entertainment, and when he worries that he has nothing new to bring to his performances, he's ready to give it up. However, his speech about how skating consumed his life so that there was no room for anything else, added to the fact that you can't get as good as Victor is without putting the work in, suggest strong Technician skills too.
</li><li> Yuri "Yurio" Plisetsky is a Technician when being kept on a leash by Yakov and Lilia, but seems to be a more natural Performer. His coaches spend hours on technical elements and hammering out imperfections. However, the Agape program (choreographed and initially coached by Victor) had emotion rather than technical skill at its heart, and <em>that</em> is the program he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">sets a world record</span> with. By contrast, his free skate is technically demanding to the point of being nightmarish, but doesn't inspire the same level of emotional intensity in Yurio. When he gets his own way in his self-choreographed exhibition skate, he's purely focused on putting on a show, although his technical skill is still present.
</li><li> Other skaters in the story are presented on a sliding scale between Technician and Performer; Phichit Chulanont's ultimate goal is to put on an ice show to show the world how fun skating is, and Yuri calls him "a born entertainer", while Seung-gil Lee is entirely fixated on the technical aspect of figure skating and is constantly calculating his score as he performs.

Tabitha clearly enjoys making artwork, with a very performer-esque demeanor, but she often writes over her (very good) drawings without showing them to anyone, and claims that art doesn't have to be seen to matter. Shaky is generally more clinical and detached when it comes to his work, and says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitingTheHandHumor">he isn't a real artist because he only wrote comic books for money</a> but he also admits that his art, particularly his diary, matters to him because he wants people to read it and know about him, which is a mentality better suited for a performer than a technician.

Twilight is the Technician <em>par excellence</em>, having graduated with a perfect GPA from Luna's Academy Of Magic a year early and only having honed her understanding of magic since. Trixie, by contrast, couldn't care less about magical theory, despite being the Lunaverse's Element Of Magic. She learns spells not from books, but by watching other ponies cast them. Her specialty is illusion magic, and half her "magic" is actually sleight-of-hoof tricks. Twilight's refusal to accept that a mare who doesn't care a whit for arcane theory could possibly be the Element of Magic is what sets off the plot of <em>Boast Busted</em>. In the later episode <em>Magic Tutor</em>, Twilight and Trixie are forced to work together when trying to teach magic to the foals of Ponyville. Trixie's explanations are so vague that the foals have a hard time understanding them, while Twilight is so technical that the foals find it hard to pay attention.

</li><li> Ash in <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11803928/13/Challenger">Challenger<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> serves as a performer to the students' technicians when he fights the top ten students at a Pokemon prep school. Part of why Ash utterly destroys so many of them is because of his unusual battling style that clashes with their theory based training. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TaughtByExperience">The rest is because while they study theory and type match ups, Ash has actually gotten into dozens of battles and learned from each of them</a>.

While both are strong in all areas, Viktor has better technical skating skills, being able to pull out several complicated jumps and land them with ease; Yuuri, however, is a better performer, having revolutionized step-sequencing to the point that the ISU had to actually clarify how they scored step-sequencing just for him, and perfect compulsory figures to compliment how much control he has over his body.

Cafe Prime is a massive coffeehouse chain with fifteen locations in Vale alone but they're heavily focused on "efficiency" which means their tables are suffocatingly close together, their customer service feels fake, and their coffee is cheap but acceptable. Jaune's is a mom and pop store owned by Jaune Arc which, while more expensive, has par excellence customer service with friendly staff, a wide variety of coffee considered the best in the city, and a friendly and inviting atmosphere. It also shows in how they try to compete with one another: Cafe Prime will offer free coffee or hire expensive celebrities to host shows at their locations while Jaune's will use costumes and decorations to make themed weekends like dressing up as pirates.

Overall, Ernesto is the Performer: charismatic, outgoing and able to draw the crowds but as a performer, hes a Technician: polished but emotionally vacant. Héctor, as a songwriter, would be the Technician, since he created the songs that made Ernesto famous, but as a songwriter, hes really a Performer: sincere and heartfelt, as is shown in how he created Remember Me, not as a cheesy love ballad but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> as a tender lullaby for his beloved daughter, Coco.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MonstersUniversity">Monsters University</a></em>, Mike is the Technician to Sulley's Performer. Mike is incredibly knowledgeable about scare tactics but doesn't have the appearance to be a good scarer. Sulley's natural abilities impress the teachers and others at first but he barely studies and lacks the technical aspects of scaring children. This ends up as a deconstruction: Mike knows what to make of every situation, he knows what scares to give to each child and how to milk information out of every profile, but his lack of practical ability ultimately makes it pointless for him to even try. Sully has a good technique, but he only has that single one technique, that does not work on every situation and could often result in him making a mistake, which comes from his lack of interest in even reading the profiles. They can't really do anything having only a single one of these capacities.

Finn is an imaginative child who simply wants to have fun building LEGOs and making up stories while his father is a serious hobbyist who believes in building sets as stated by their instructions and keeping them as such.</span> As such, the film's plot is focused on the conflict between the Master Builders who wish to build whatever they want as they please and Lord Business, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">based on Finn's dad.

Astrid hones her skills with incredible effort and traditional weaponry; Hiccup strives to <em>understand</em> the dragon mind so he can direct and pacify them without bloodshed. This represents the duality of Viking culture; fearless savagery coupled with ideals and creative strategies. Hiccup's Performer style is ultimately superior, but he needs Astrid's pragmatic mind to pull him through the dark parts of his 'saga'.

Colette on the other hand insists on sticking to Chef Gusteau's tried-and-true recipes. Over the course of the movie they start to learn from each other: Remy taking Colette's advice on how to work in a professional kitchen while she learns to trust his instincts and experiment with flavor. By the end they've become a highly successful team that knows how to play off each other's skillsets.

Ryan and Sharpay have been singing for years, view star roles as status symbols and audition with professionally choreographed routines, expensive costumes and back up musicians.

This is also apparent in their stage names: "The Great Danton" and "The Professor," respectively. Unique in that in this case, both the technician and the performer have their sympathetic moments. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The trope is later subverted in that Angier's illusion relies on technology but Borden's is pure performance.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekIITheWrathOfKhan">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a></em>: Khan and his crew as Performer, and Kirk and his crew as Technician. While Khan is brilliant and ruthless (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">crazy</a>) and commands a crew of Augments, Kirk has him beat with superior training, experience, and familiarity with ship-to-ship combat. Khan manages to surprise Kirk (thanks to Kirk <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">ignoring regulations</a>) and draw first blood, but Kirk soon evens the odds and takes advantage of Khan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceIsAnOcean">two-dimensional thinking</a> to cripple his ship.

</li><li> The film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrictlyBallroom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrictlyBallroom">Strictly Ballroom</a></em> is all about the conflict between highly technical rulesy dancing and "crowd-pleasing" moves. Differs somewhat from the pure form of the trope in that it hints that the technical rules are don't really represent dancing skill but rather a conspiracy to keep the person who makes the rules in the money and also in that the main character is excellent at the technical style but choses to do "crowd pleasing" because he likes it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StickIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StickIt">Stick It</a></em>, about gymnastics, deals with the dichotomy of focusing on perfection and "sticking" everything versus going all out and "flooring it" and doing things that are more impressive even if you can't guarantee you'll nail the technical elements perfectly. The end message seems to be that it's not about what you know, but who you know, so if you don't know the right people you may as well say screw the rules and have fun with it.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSwan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackSwan">Black Swan</a></em> uses this trope to illustrate the differences in the dancing of the two main characters. Nina is technically flawless, but she's cold, controlled and distant, which makes her an excellent White Swan and a bad Black Swan. Meanwhile, Lily dances more instinctively, lacking the technical chops but letting her warm and sensuous personality come through. This makes her an excellent Black Swan but a sub-par White Swan. The ballet director is torn because he would prefer to cast one dancer as both roles. In this case the narrative favours Nina as the Technician - as Thomas tries to get her to learn to loosen up so she can play the Black Swan.

Niki Lauda is almost clinical in his approach to driving, a master at setting up a race car and one of the first drivers to put in long hours studying the tracks.

Mozart seems to make it up right off the top of his head "as if he were taking dictation", according to Salieri.
<ul><li> Although it is hinted this is largely an act by Mozart and he does work very hard at composition, part of the reason for his decline is he refuses to do any work such as teaching that would pay well because it would take away the time he needs for composition.

Bruce (the technician, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenKingsley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenKingsley">Ben Kingsley</a>) is a respected chess master who strictly adheres to traditional chess theory and strategy.

Vinnie (the performer, played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurenceFishburne">Laurence Fishburne</a>), on the other hand is a street hustler who has a very fast and loose play style, moves by instinct without thinking about it, ignores traditional theory and strategy and encourages Josh to "play from the gut". Bruce's training seems to take away the joy of the game for Josh, while Josh seems to be happier when playing with Vinnie. Josh eventually adopts elements of both styles of play into his own.

Mary Jane is a beloved and respected piano teacher, so her skill is technically brilliant when she plays a piece for the party - but the majority of the guests are bored by it and only applaud out of politeness. Aunt Julia was once a soprano in a church choir but is significantly older, and her performance of "Arrayed For the Bridal" has some warbling - but she sings with such passion and enthusiasm that it moves all the guests.

Rob Marshall apparently didn't want "a singer who could kind of act" and rather wanted someone who would give the songs the emotion they needed. It seems the critics agreed - as Emily got a Golden Globe nomination for the performance (and the fans consider her to be a highlight of the cast).

<ul><li> In Piers Anthony's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept">Blue Adept</a></em> this is played straight in Stile's harmonica duel with Clef where they will be judged by the Computer on their technical skills and the audience on their performance. Clef is by far superior on a technical basis, allowing him to easily win the Computer vote, while Stile wins the audience with a superior performance.
<ul><li> As a tie-breaker the two play a duet to be judged by a panel of musicians. After a little coaching from Stile, Clef quickly picks up Stile's tricks and also begins drawing in the audience, resulting in him winning the vote of the Computer and audience... but Stile wins the panel's vote and thus the contest. Clef's improvement was solely thanks to Stile, which the panel saw as proof that Stile was the better musician. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">The two become life-long friends</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BalletShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BalletShoes">Ballet Shoes</a></em>:
<ul><li> Played with a bit, where it's mentioned at one point that Petrova the sister who hates dancing ends up being one of the most technically proficient dancers in the school <em>because</em> she hates dancing, so she ends up taking basic classes year after year and gets all the core moves completely ground into her mind. But her performer sisters are the ones who always get major roles in ballets and plays, while she's always (gladly) stuck in the background. Although in this case her sisters aren't <em>bad</em> at technique they just never learn it by rote the way she does (and when one of them does end up stuck in that same situation, her performer side comes out more strongly than it does at any other time in the book).
</li><li> Played very straight when it comes to Winifred - who is a Jill of all trades - versus Pauline - who is a good actress but merely competent at dancing and singing. Winifred loses the part of Alice to Pauline mainly because she's from a poor family and looks shabby at auditions, and also seems to lack Pauline's charisma.
</li><li> Dulcie (Technician) and Hilary (Performer) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DancingShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DancingShoes">Dancing Shoes</a></em> play out the above description almost to the letter.
</li><li> In <em>White Boots</em> (known as <em>Skating Shoes</em> in the US), Lalla is the Performer, Harriet is the Technician. This is a slightly unusual example in that it's Harriet, the newcomer to ice skating, who's the more precise skater (usually, the Performer is the rookie) and that the book comes out on her side - Lalla is sympathetic and charming, but also a bit of a spoiled brat, while Harriet is modest and loyal.
</li></ul></li><li> This comes up several times in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a> books.
<ul><li> In the stories involving the Witch Trials, Granny Weatherwax is the Technician and she always wins but Nanny Ogg is the Performer, and people buy her drinks and say "It was a good try". Both of them are happy with this. In "The Sea And Little Fishes", in response to someone commenting on Granny's "natural talent", Nanny notes she has much more "natural talent" than Granny Weatherwax, but the latter is the most respected and feared witch alive by dint of years of sheer, bloody-minded application of the little talent she does have. Nanny, however, has the ability to get along with anyone she meets instantly, which is one trick Granny has never picked up.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Maskerade">Maskerade</a></em>, where Bucket, Salzella <em>et al.</em> argue that though Agnes is the technically superior singer who puts in all the work, Christine has superior stage presence and "star power" (read: she's thin, blonde and conventionally attractive). In truth, Agnes is both performer (she is naturally talented) and technician (she works to improve), while Christine cannot sing for peanuts.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Snuff">Snuff</a></em>, Lord Vetinari is a bit put-out to realize that, after decades of his own painstaking, methodical, brilliant and technically-elegant social engineering have brought Ankh-Morpork to a state of prosperity and eminence, a naive young goblin girl with a harp has drastically elevated the social standing of her people on an international scale with <em>one song</em>. And with only a little help from a children's author and Lady Sybil's address book.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>, both protagonist Elizabeth and her bookish younger sister Mary play the piano and sing. Mary is a technically accomplished musician (with a terrible singing voice) who practices hard and works for accomplishments. Elizabeth isn't as skilled technically in her playing, but her performances are cheerful and pleasing, and on the whole people much prefer to listen to her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma">Emma</a></em>: Emma Woodhouse plays the piano rather well, but she didn't practise enough as a child to reach true mastery. Jane Fairfax is as old as Emma, and just as talented in music as she is, but Jane has a deeper love for music and she has been a diligent student and plays perfectly. Emma is a skilled performer, but Jane is <em>both</em> a technician <em>and</em> a performer. Though some people do not see it...
<div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> Dont class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like hers, than a lamp is like sunshine.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Oh! dear  I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfaxs is much beyond it.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Emma:</strong> Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Harriet:</strong> Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing. There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to teach.

Jane is the technician, Vincent is the performer.

Jeremy does an act in his performances, whereas Carmen just plays. Carmen is envious of how comfortable he is, while she relies on drugs to keep from getting nervous before concerts. It's played with since Jeremy has his own problems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongAtDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SongAtDawn">Song at Dawn</a>:</em> Maracuba is the Technican and Dragonetz is the Performer. The former has a rigid singing style and his ballads are sermons in lyrical form. Furthermore, Estela reluctantly admits he has greater skill than Dragonetz. On the other hand Dragonetz's goal is entertaining and he has a much wider range of pitches and actions. For instance, he'll sing a women's part in a duet using a falsetto tone and act out the role.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BertoltBrecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> wrote a short story about two Chinese guys who wanted to become actors. One of them went to the best teachers and trained until late at night, while the other one went to the market places where he would juggle, make fun of the bigwigs and other jokes. Then the day came where both of them had to show off what they had learned: The performer did his usual tricks and received some applause; the technician was struck by stage fear and immediately fainted. With a subversion: The people commented that he played it well, although the play was a bit short.
</li><li> In the backstory of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WithoutBloodshed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WithoutBloodshed">Without Bloodshed</a></em>, violinist Christabel is an almost-pure Technician, and a Prima Donna in the bargain. Guitarist Morgan and vocalist/keyboardist Naomi are performers with considerable technique and compositional of their own. Though the band Crowley's Thoth is named after Christabel Crowley, it's Morgan and Naomi who make the band work in the studio and on tour. Christabel resented her bandmates' popularity and tendency to constantly upstage her. Morgan and Naomi wish she'd loosen up, study some music theory, help write some songs, and be ready to perform when the show starts.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThousandCultures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThousandCultures">A Million Open Doors</a></em>, the difference between performance and technique is discussed; For Giraut, as an Occitan, the way that one performs a piece of music is the crucial thing, but on Caledony, where "reason" trumps everything else, all performances are judged based on technique, because style is considered objective.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RCN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RCN">RCN</a></em>: The difference as captains between Daniel Leary and Lieutenant Vesey, his first officer for most of the series. Vesey is well-educated and a fine sailor, but as a combatant she lacks her CO's aggression and instinct for killing. It's remarked at least once that if she is given a permanent command of her own and faces a major battle, she'll fall back on training and perform competently, but will probably never match Daniel for sheer skill.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsAhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneHundredYearsAhead">One Hundred Years Ahead</a></em>: An academic variation, implied in the case with the 6B class's two best students, Mila Rutkevich and Kolya Sulima. Mila is described as a "principled A-student", to the point that the teachers feel awkward giving her anything less than an A. She is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist">The Perfectionist</a> who devotes all her time to studies and is furious when Alice becomes a better student than her. Kolya is also a hard-working student, but he isn't mentioned to get straight As like Mila, concentrating only on the fields that personally interest him. Unlike her, he is involved in extracurricular activities (chess and a scientific society at the planetarium) and is much more sociable and friendly. Their futures (at least, according to Alice) reflect it: Mila is to become a very strict school headmistress and Kolya is to become World Chess Champion and invent the time machine.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first years of the War of Five Kings is an exhaustive study of this;
<ul><li> Royalist leader Tywin Lannister is the Technician; exhaustively educated, a veteran of at <em>least</em> four separate wars over the course of his sixty-year life, and intimately familiar with the geological and political landscape of Southern Westeros — which is on the verge of shattering into utter chaos because the previous king died under questionable circumstances and the current monarch's lineage is publicly questioned. Oh, and he is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">filthy fucking rich</a></em>. However, he has only moderate support from his generals, he's fighting for a teenaged monarch who is already infamous for his viciousness and outright stupidity, and much of his forces are mercenaries.
</li><li> Rebel leader Robb Stark is the Performer; young, inexperienced and <em>completely</em> ignorant of the territory he is smashing through on his way to the capital to collect the head of his father's murderer. And he's so strapped for cash that his primary source of funds is ransoming enemy knights. He's also an absolute <em>animal</em> in combat(mind his awesome <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor">horse-sized wolf</a></em> if you value your life), beloved by his bannermen with whom he's been close friends with since he could walk, fighting for the independence of a kingdom that adored his father completely and enthusiastically supports his quest for vengeance, and all his forces are volunteers with high morale.
</li><li> Robb wins <em>every single battle he fights,</em> so Tywin eventually realizes he can't win on the battlefield and bribes a third party into slaughtering Robb's forces in a blatant violation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacredHospitality">Sacred Hospitality</a>. He also dies on the privy with two crossbow bolts in his chest because he treats his allies like shit.
</li></ul></li><li> In terms of her linguistic skills, Missandei and Dany have this dynamic. The latter, being naturally quite boastful and self-absorbed (albeit endearingly so to Missandei), is quite proud of her mastery of Dothraki, Valyrian, and Common Tongue, but Missandei has a better technical grasp of those languages (since it is after all her main skillset). As such she latches on to linguistic subtleties like the gender-neutral nature of Valyrian which Dany missed since she mostly uses the language to communicate without attention to grammatical exactitude.
</li></ul></li><li> Tends to show up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrictlyComeDancing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrictlyComeDancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a></em> and similar series - some of the competitors will be technically skilled, but not really able to sell a dance and perform - they tend to sail through the early stages. Others will struggle on technical skill early on, but be able to perform really well - as their technical skill increases through practice, they start to provide serious challenges to the technical dancers, whose skill has plateaued, and who still can't act.
<ul><li> Chris Hollins compared with Ali Bastian.
</li><li> John Sergeant in the 2008 series of <em>Strictly</em> was a Performer who eventually left the show because his popularity wasn't fair on the Technicians.
<div class="indent"><strong>Sergeant</strong>: There now exists a real possibility I might win. Even for me, that would be a joke too far.
</div></li><li> Subverted with Jason Donovan on Series 9, who certainly looked like a Performer on stage but put in the long hours of hard work of a Technician. This was because he had <em>no natural talent whatsoever</em>; he had to put in that much work just to get his ability to "bluff your way through on charm" level.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DancingWithTheStars">Dancing with the Stars</a></em> features a twist on this trope. In almost every season, the "technician" role is filled by current or former athletes, while the "performer" role is filled by entertainers of one form or another. Both groups have people with widely varying dance experience, based either on the athlete's specific sport or the entertainer's specific genre. Season 26, in which all of the celebrity contestants were athletes, still had this dynamic, with the "performer" role filled by the three figure skaters.
<ul><li> Several <em>DWTS</em> judges have well-known biases toward one side of this divide. Len tends strongly to favor the technical side of things while Bruno and to a lesser extent Carrie Ann prefer the Performers.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1">Stargate SG-1</a></em>, Rodney McKay describes the difference between himself and Samantha Carter as this, bemoaning the fact that his technical approach to things earns him second place to the less rigidly formal. Apparently this has affected him his whole life. He mentions that as a child he wanted to be a pianist, but his teacher told him to quit because, while he was a good technical player, he had no sense of the art.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee">Glee</a></em>:
<ul><li> The show makes Vocal Adrenaline out to be the "technically-perfect team with no soul" whereas New Directions are the plucky underdogs who make up for their lack of polish with their bleeding hearts.
</li><li> Technician vs. Performer in some form kicks in within New Directions itself, particularly with regard to Rachel, who tends to be technically adept but an imitative and immature performer whose goal is winning approval and applause, and the rest of the girls (plus countertenor Kurt - they're in competition because they share equal ranges and song preferences), who sing with more originality, authenticity and emotion. However, it also applies in reverse to the boys. Finn, as by far the least accomplished of the male singers and dancers, looks like he should be an underdog Performer type - but he's resented for getting solos while other (far more accomplished and enthusiastic) singers such as Artie, Kurt and Puck, and dancer Mike, are undeservedly stuck in his shadow - largely because of Technician vs. Performer favoritism from Will Schuester.
</li></ul></li><li> Briefly mentioned in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a></em>. The episode's villain is a violin prodigy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> who is able to pull out incredible performances either spontaneously or from memory, but has no formal training and can't read sheet music. When he auditions for a spot in an orchestra, at first he aces, but when he's asked to play from a sheet he's completely helpless and gets shown the door. The guy running the audition mentions that this is a real problem when finding musicians- often the only applicants are artists who can't or won't just play what's in the book.
</li><li> Often happens on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoYouThinkYouCanDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SoYouThinkYouCanDance">So You Think You Can Dance</a></em>, especially with b-boys. While technically wonderful dancers are often competent enough to stay on the show for a while even if their performance isn't too amazing, dancers like season 7's Jose sail through because they're fun to watch even if they don't dance very well. It also has a major part in deciding who wins- there's a reason the winner is '[Country's] <em>Favourite</em> Dancer'. People with bright personalities may well win over more technically gifted dancers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopChef">Top Chef</a></em> is a strange case, since there's so many sides to it, but it qualifies. It's why people like Fabio and Carla were so well liked, since they more qualified as performers than technicians (while Carla was classically trained, her food was more soulful than anything else). Occasionally, competitions will play out where one side chooses to make food that isn't terribly suited for the occasion, but showcases some culinary skills, while the other makes food the audience will enjoy. The judges tend to prefer the former.
</li><li> Can happen on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ProjectRunway">Project Runway</a></em>, too; the people with the most skill at sewing or the most experience in the fashion business aren't always the ones with the most creativity and innovation. Again can go both ways; a creative person who can't sew at all will probably be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationCatchphrase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationCatchphrase">auf'd</a>, but so will an impeccable seamstress whose designs are boring.
<ul><li> The two frontrunners of Season 9, Anya Ayoung-Chee and Viktor Luna, are a textbook example of the trope. Anya is badly inexperienced at sewing but often turns out very striking outfits, while Viktor is an extremely skilled garment-maker most often criticized for lacking "the wow factor."
</li></ul></li><li> The whole point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smash">Smash</a></em>. Ivy is the technician (generally, she is more able to "sex-up" the role of Marilyn Monroe than Karen and is a very good actor in her own right) having previous Broadway experience, and knowing how to the play the game to get the role. Karen, on the other hand, has no previous theater experience, and shows up to her audition not dressed as Marilyn or singing one of her songs, yet her audition for the role of Marilyn impresses the producers and directors so much they decide to put her in the chorus, and make her the understudy for Marilyn. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Ivy gets the role of Marilyn, then loses it to a famous movie actress (Rebecca), cast in an effort to attract more publicity. Then as Rebecca gets an allergic reaction, Karen gets the role, as she has "something" that Ivy does not.</span>
</li><li> Sasha (Technician) and Boo (Performer) are a nuanced version of this in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bunheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bunheads">Bunheads</a></em>. A more blatant contrast in one episode is Jordan (Technician) and Karl (Performer), perhaps because they are only minor characters. There are also hints of this with Fanny (Technician) and Michelle (Performer) in there roles as teachers and in their relationship with the girls (Fanny is stern and strict and the girls both worship and fear her while Michelle plays the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSister">Cool Big Sister</a>). The Ringer is so soulessly perfect that she makes technician Sasha look like a performer.
</li><li> Happens with some regularity in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SweetGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SweetGenius">Sweet Genius</a></em>. Some chefs will have flawless technique but produce relatively unimaginative "safe" desserts, others will have fantastic ideas and less impressive technique. All other factors remaining equal, Chef Ron seems to favor the creative approach, though not by much. A Sweet Genius should have both technique <em>and</em> vision.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbbysUltimateDanceCompetition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AbbysUltimateDanceCompetition">Abby's Ultimate Dance Competition</a></em>, six-year-old Asia Ray stayed in the competition much longer than kids who were better than her technically, ultimately placing third, based largely on the fact that she was a fantastic performer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms">Dance Moms</a></em>:
<ul><li> For some time in the first and part of the second season, Maddie was portrayed as having the strongest technique thanks to interview clips from Abby and the moms constantly praising (or sometimes scorning) Maddie for her perfectionist tendencies. Conversely, early underdog Chloe was portrayed as an imperfect dancer with a few technical issues to work on, but one who had the <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. Despite the portrayals of the trope, possibly designed to make more root for the sweet and shy Chloe, early on it was quite clear to those in the dance field that Chloe was actually the more technically sound dancer, with better lines and stronger turns, while Maddie's main strength was in her performance and facial expressions. This was, however, played straight around season 3, when Chloe began to take time away from competitive dance and Maddie made major technical progression.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceMoms">Dance Moms</a></em>, despite the technician/performer dichotomy between Chloe and Maddie, who were both, at the end of the day, fairly technically sound dancers with fairly strong stage presence/performance (which one edged out the other seemed to vary from week to week early on), it could have been played straight with girls like Paige and Nia. Both were admonished for their weak technique early on despite being natural performers. The main problem was, unlike Chloe, Paige and Nia rarely had their own shining moments on stage. A notable exception was in Season 2, when Paige pulled out a rare overall win against both Chloe and Maddie in the junior category.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RuPaulsDragRace">RuPaul's Drag Race</a></em> used to appear that Ru preferred technicians to performers come the final elimination, that is until season 4 onward, when Ru will start asking for the Drag Race audience to give their online feedback on the queens, who usually show preference to the performer. Season 4's Chad Michaels (Technician, gives flawless presentations and performances), and Sharon Needles (Performer, spooky but lovable with a big heart and lots of creativity) are perfect examples of this dynamic in action.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Mythbusters">Mythbusters</a></em> are hosted by the stolid, detail-oriented Technician Jamie and the goofy, improvising Performer Adam. This trope comes into play when they have build-offs where each has to offer their own take on a myth, and usually have to build some manner of wacky gadget in the process. Jamie generally has the better grasp of engineering and design theory, but Adam is usually the one coming up with all the weird, novel ideas. In this case, the Technician tends to win because his work usually agrees with the laws of physics. Their respective approaches are exemplified in the 2013 episode "Hypermiling/Crash Cushions": tasked with making two models out of foam for an upcoming test, Adam simply sketches a rough outline on the foam block and starts cutting, ending up surrounded by a mountain of foam scraps, while Jamie gets on a computer to design and print out a form that will allow him to proceed neatly and efficiently.
</li><li> Applies to cars rather than people, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> provides an example with the Corvette <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zr1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zr1">Zr 1</a> vs. the Audi R8:
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMeanBrit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMeanBrit">Jeremy Clarkson</a></strong>: Be in no doubt that the Audi is the better car. It's better built, better looking, better to drive, easier to park and - in the real world - faster. You'd have to be <em>bonkers</em> to buy the Corvette. And that, is why you should.
</div><ul><li> This is apparently the dynamic between British cars (Performer) and German cars (Technician). British cars aren't exactly the most reliable nor the most powerful, but they do tend to be really aesthetically pleasing, and ooze charm and style. German cars tend to be amazing feats of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">precision engineering</a>, but are regarded as joyless and a bit boring to drive.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DanceAcademy">Dance Academy</a></em> explores and partially deconstructs this trope with Tara and Abigail's ongoing rivalry. Abigail—rival and sometimes antagonist—is the Technician: fantastic technical dancer, but is said to be "very cold". Tara—the heroine—is the Performer not nearly as technically proficient (even having to start her time at the Academy relearning the basics) but earnest and emotive. As a show about dance, <em>Dance Academy</em> also explores the topic of physical potential: Tara has an idea body type for ballet, and Abigail doesn't. Originally the Technician vs. Performer trope is played very straight, with the narrative being in Tara's favor—she's the protagonist. But as the show wears on, it explores the other side, developing Abigail's characters as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Defrosting Ice Queen</a>, showing her more sympathetically. The trope is eventually deconstructed, exploring the heartache Abigail experiences—she works <em>so hard</em>, sometimes pushing herself past the point of what's healthy, all because she <em>desperately</em> wants it, but in contrast with naturals like Tara, that's only barely enough.

<ul><li> In season 1, Claire uses technical exercises to cover up the fact that she has no clue about the actual emotional dynamics of the character she's playing. Her understudy Kate jumps in at the last minute when Claire breaks her leg, and is a massive success despite being underrehearsed by virtue of her emotional performance.
</li><li> Season 2 looks like it's going to work similarly, with Henry the technician who knows the part of Macbeth cold, and Jerry his less-practiced understudy whose very uncertainty about the role makes his performance more vivid. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The difference is, Henry — unlike Claire — really is the better actor; the epiphany the director has upon seeing Jerry play the role is not "Jerry needs to keep playing this part" but "I need to find some way to knock Henry off-balance."</span>

Mildred's imagination and quick thinking usually saves the day. Miss Cackle likewise gives a speech in the first episode about spellcasting that the right words aren't as important as the right feeling - meaning that witchcraft in this case favours the 'Performer' school.
</li><li> Also in regards to Witches vs Wizards in general. Witches are the Technicians - with magic being used more for practical purposes - and they cast spells entirely through their intelligence. Wizards are the Performers - they're far flashier and more flamboyant in how they cast magic - and they do so by use of a big impressive staff.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bellas</a> would have began as Performers - models hired for their looks and personality - but improved their wrestling to be considered Technicians. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Paige">Paige</a> is a veteran Technician who has been wrestling since she was thirteen - but became popular once she adopted her 'Anti-Diva' gimmick, thus having a lot of a Performer in her too. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AliciaFox">Alicia Fox</a> too was previously a Performer but years of training gained her the technical ability too.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RobotWars">Robot Wars</a></em>, several contestants built robots that apply as examples of either, though most enjoy being a Performer over a (in this case, a literal) Technician. One infamous example was between the biggest Performer Diotior against Technician Tornado. Diotoir was the crowd's favourite despite never succeeding, clad in fur that caught fire, had a big cheesy grin on the front and was quite slow. Tornado was built for speed, reached a semi final, built by a team motivated by winning at all costs and was usually described as a very fast "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">box on wheels</a>". You may think the Technician Tornado would win, but with some creative use of its flipper, Diotoir won by pitting Tornado.

There are however specific examples from the series:
<ul><li> Brendan (Technician) versus James (Performer) in series 3.
</li><li> Lucy in series 4 made very plain breadsticks ("Grissini with Salt") in the Signature round in the hope that the judges would be impressed with the technical qualities, whilst everybody else was trying much more elaborate recipes. She did this because she knew bread was a weak spot and so concentrated on getting it technically right, rather than being showy — unfortunately, she <em>didn't</em> get it right and, following a similar problem in the Showstopper round with a roasted tomato and garlic bread loaf, she was eliminated.
</li><li> And in the final of that series, Kimberley (Technician) vs Frances (Performer).

Young Kevin takes piano lessons and he's a rather reluctant about it because Ronald Hirschmuller (who is his age and plays before him) is so much better. However, Kevin's piano teacher tries to encourage him by pointing out he has talent (she even suggests that he has more talent than Ronald) and that he just needs to practise. Kevin dedicates his time to practising and realizes he likes playing. However, his confidence suffers a blow — during a rehearsal before their recital, Kevin finds out that Ronald plays the very same piece and that he plays it perfectly. He keeps comparing their performances and then he unfortunately makes lots of mistakes during the recital. His teacher encourages him that he will play better next time, but it's revealed that Kevin gave up piano entirely.

This was pushed on them by their stage magician father who realized it would be great for a public act. It's shown that Jonathan is better at things like lockpicking and the more technical sides of tricks. However, Cameron is far better a natural performer and thus, he was the one given the public identity of the "lone" Black while Jonathan was kept to the shadows.

Sento is the Technician, a genius physicist whose work is based on solid scientific theory and research, and as Kamen Rider Build has the ability to adapt to any situation. Banjou is the Performer, a former MMA fighter who's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb">Book Dumb</a> but has good instincts, and as Kamen Rider Cross-Z has to rely on his own skills and power to overcome obstacles.

Jade has spent years learning how to sing and act. Tori on the other hand is untrained (in one episode she admits she doesn't know what an understudy is) and relies more on her natural talent. This is exemplified in an episode where they participate in an acting exercise where they must stay in character as long as possible. Jade gives a more subtle and convincing performance, whereas Tori's performance is deliberately over the top and comedic.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em>: The episode <em>Debate 109</em> shows the pitfalls of adhering too closely to one or the other. Annie, the technician, knows her facts and the rules of competitive debate, but fails to make much impact due to her stilted, robotic delivery. Conversely, Jeff the performer is able to win over the crowd with his natural charisma and talent at bluster, but his lack of anything approaching a cogent argument scores him zero. Ultimately, Annie has to learn to loosen up, and Jeff has to make an effort to learn, in order for them to succeed.

In a TV documentary about Christina, a producer from the <em>Mickey Mouse Club</em> said that the talented vocalist Christina often had trouble competing with professional dancer and performer Britney. Their fans also support them for different reasons, Christina's fans are here for her powerful thunderous vocals, and Britney fans like her performance and expression of emotions and stage show. There are alternative theories that Britney has better technique (besides smoking) and spends months mastering her show's technique wise vs Christina is a screechy senseless performer who focuses on the show of her voice.

</li><li> An unusually common situation: An actor-who-sings tends to be much more successful than the reverse. Though both fields are demanding, singing is also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">extremely focused</a>; singers (Technicians) often lack the physical presence needed to connect to the audience, while actors (Performers) may not be the best singers, but know how to get reactions from audiences. Underlining the differences, many actors already <em>are</em> decent singers—but they view it as a fun way to kill time, while singers view acting as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>.
</li><li> This trope is the main reason why it's generally not a good idea to try to discuss either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GarageRock">Garage Rock</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProgressiveRock">Progressive Rock</a> with fans of the other. The divide between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunkRock">Punk Rock</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> isn't as strong, but they fit this trope too.
</li><li> Despite his clear technical skills, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JimiHendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> was closer to the Performer end of the spectrum. Had virtually no formal musical training, could barely even read music, but was blessed with natural talent and near-perfect pitch. Nobody taught Jimi how to play; HE JUST KNEW, man...
<ul><li> This was never made more apparent than when Hendrix requested a jam session with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Cream">Cream</a> when he first arrived in London. This was at the peak of "Clapton is God" amongst English rock fans, and many were shocked that Hendrix even dared share the stage with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EricClapton">Eric Clapton</a>. As good as he is though, Clapton was more on the Technician side and had a very stoic stage presence. Hendrix, by contrast, tore ass through "Killing Floor" doing his usual tricks (playing behind his back, with his teeth, playing with feedback, laying into the whammy bar, etc). As Jack Bruce said later "Clapton was playing guitar. Hendrix was a force of nature."
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeavyMetal">Heavy Metal</a> bands with two guitarists run on this trope. Often the two guitarists will cultivate wildly different lead styles from each other and play off each other in elaborate and extended "duels". Notable twin-guitar teams fitting this mold include:

(In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MitchBenn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MitchBenn">Mitch Benn</a> is the 37th Beatle</em>, Mitch rather cruelly describes Harrison as someone who "realised that the way to become a rock star when you had no personality whatsoever was to become <em>really good</em> at all the complicated fiddly bits".)

</li><li> Exemplified perfectly in Charlie Daniels' song "The Devil Went Down to Georgia", with Johnny as the Performer and the Devil as the Technician. While the Devil plays a far more complicated and difficult piece, it pales in comparison to the beauty of Johnny's song.

For that matter, Brian May is an <em>astrophysicist</em>.
</li><li> Electric Guitars (the band, not the instrument) is an interesting example. The band features two guitar players, Soren Andersen and Mika Vandborg. On any given song, whoever sings is the Technician, while the other is the Performer.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KISS">KISS</a> with their lead guitarists. Ace Frehley was a Performer, more known for his guitar emitting smoke and firing rockets than for his playing, and he was once described as "a cheap <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Jimmy Page</a> imitation in a flashy costume". His replacements in the 80's (Vinnie Vincent, Mark St. John, Bruce Kulick) were all Technicians who could play rings around him, but never connected with the audience the way he did. In fact, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons jokingly called Bruce "Spruce Kulick" when he first joined because of his lack of stage presence and just standing there like a tree onstage. Current guitarist Tommy Thayer is also a Technician, but more a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedFanboy">Promoted Fanboy</a> as he idolized Kiss and Ace growing up.

Lorde spends a lot of time collecting beats and rhythms and applying it to her music. Lana focuses more on performing the emotions and telling a story.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoyBand">Boy Bands</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlGroup">Girl Groups</a> can have this. The Technician is usually the lead singer because they have the strongest voice in the group, but the Performer, often the other half of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalTagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalTagTeam">Vocal Tag Team</a>, may have a more engaging presence that draws the audience and camera to them. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakupBreakout">Breakup Breakout</a> is almost always the Performer due to their ability to keep the audience engaged and while the Technician can also be more critically successful, they won't reach the commercial popularity of the Performer.
</li><li> Lead guitarists are often seen as performers rather than technicians, which has lead to the creation of many lead guitarist stereotypes. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.realitista.com/post/31868775053/sheet-music-and-lead-guitarists">For example<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Even within the highly technical shredding style of guitar, a division exists between pure "shredders", who mostly kept their shredding improvised, and were more often seen in more commercial bands, and the Neoclassical guitarists who tended to place an emphasis on a understanding of music theory, and rigidly structured playing, often forgoing vocalists and conventional song structures to create instrumental symphonies.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MileyCyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SelenaGomez">Selena Gomez</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BellaThorne">Bella Thorne</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HilaryDuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HilaryDuff">Hilary Duff</a> (performer), vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DemiLovato">Demi Lovato</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilyOsment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EmilyOsment">Emily Osment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BridgitMendler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BridgitMendler">Bridgit Mendler</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LizzieMcGuire">Lalaine</a> (technician).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> (technician) often teamed up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BillyJoel">Billy Joel</a> (performer) for shows since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a>. Both are classically trained, however.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The seventies-era Stones</a> were an odd example, particularly on stage. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickJagger">Mick Jagger</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KeithRichards">Keith Richards</a> hewed strongly toward the Performer end of the spectrum while lead guitarist <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickTaylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MickTaylor">Mick Taylor</a> was best known for his technical skill and staring at his guitar during performance. However, Taylor's improvisational ability also made him the most variable musically, and his ability to take the warhorses in odd directions is still missed in some circles compared to the steadier Ronnie Wood.
</li><li> Classical pianists: there are pianists like Maurizio Pollini who possess flawless technique, but are accused of emotionlessness, and pianists like György Cziffra or Arthur Rubinstein, who play with great passion and seamlessly ignore minor mistakes.
<ul><li> Vladimir Horowitz was both, he could play with staggering intensity, but was notorious for reworking other composers material when he thought they weren't technically perfect.
</li><li> French-Swiss pianist Alfred Cortot is an interesting case. He was a highly educated scholar of the technical side of music, taught at the Paris Conservatoire, and published meticulously annotated print editions of musical scores. But in his playing he freely varied tempos for expression and was perfectly willing to include wrong notes or other technical slip-ups in his recordings as long as the performance was effective.
</li><li> Musical scores bow to this notion as well: legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">piano virtuoso</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzLiszt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FranzLiszt">Franz Liszt</a> often allowed the interpreters great freedom in interpretation while the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BiggerIsBetter">Bigger Is Better</a> symphonic composer <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GustavMahler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GustavMahler">Gustav Mahler</a> painstakingly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist">noted every inch of his vision</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Jimmy Page, lead guitarist of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LedZeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, was a rare example of both. On the album recordings his guitar playing was precise and technical. The live versions of the same songs onstage were more emotional and improvised.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blues">Blues</a> (Performer) versus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jazz">Jazz</a> (Technician). Within blues music, artists like BB King and Albert King are often seen as technicians - whereas artists like Jimmy Reed are Howlin' Wolf are seen as performers.
</li><li> An interesting 50/50 of this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince">Prince</a>. You see Prince on stage, doing splits and tearing through epic fluid guitar solos, you'd put him on the Performer side. But according to his old engineers and collaborators, Prince was a wiz in the studio. His first album was basically a polished demo he recorded himself playing 26 different instruments ranging from guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, wind chimes and wood blocks, and more. He programmed all his own beats using his beloved Linn drum machine, knew how all the computers and tape machines worked, and cut his own vocals alone with a simple boom mic hanging over the mixing console. Classic singles like "When Doves Cry" were all him performing solo. That said, they also confirmed Prince rarely second-guessed himself, which is why he was so prolific and released so many albums. Basically, he was a Technician trying to capture the passion of a Performer, and he very more often than not succeeded.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectronicMusic">Electronic Music</a> duos pairing a producer (technician) with a DJ (performer). Examples include Bedrock (DJ John Digweed x producer Nick Muir) and Way Out West (DJ Nick Warren x producer Jody Wisternoff).
</li><li> An important feature of 80's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KingCrimson">King Crimson</a>. Robert Fripp, the mastermind behind the band and the technician, would sit there on stage not even smiling while Adrian Belew, the performer and the vocalist, would ham it up David Byrne style.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheWho">The Who</a> was all over the map. Pete Townshend's songwriting and guitar playing are mostly on the technical side, although he can still cut loose when playing live. Roger Daltrey is definitely a performer, continuing to draw crowds even after his once-mighty singing voice has weakened with age. John Entwistle was a technician through and through - in live shows he'd hardly even move, but his rock-solid bass playing was a reliable backbone the others could lean on. And whether Keith Moon was an exuberant-but-precise drummer or a crowd-pleasing rock animal depended on how many drugs he happened to be using at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Westlife">Westlife</a> had the lead vocal duo of Shane Filan and Mark Feehily. While Shane's solid, reliable, consistent voice meant he was usually trusted to sing lead for the majority of the song, it was Mark who provided the soulful, sweeping vocals that took over after the key change.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DavidBowie">David Bowie</a> was the ultimate in 'performer over technician'. Other than a handful of saxophone lessons when he was a teenager, he was not a trained musician but he was a naturally instinctive singer (rarely needing more than one take to nail a vocal), a utterly brilliant songwriter, a natural showman and had a knack for getting the best out of his collaborators (including many technicians).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SynthPop">Synth-Pop</a> duos like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yazoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Yazoo">Yazoo</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/SoftCell">Soft Cell</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Erasure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Erasure">Erasure</a> would typically pair up a quiet, technical keyboard player with a very expressive, soulful vocalist.

Startling degree of talent, wide knowledge of moves and countermoves but usually never really catch on with the casual fans at-large.
</li><li> Performer: The ur-example here is probably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HulkHogan">Hulk Hogan</a>. Never a solid performer, but he knew how to put on a show and the fans adored him, though he did put real technical matches in Japan, but no one was equating him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/OwenHart">Owen Hart</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KenShamrock">Ken Shamrock</a>.

</li><li> There are the rare wrestlers who bridge the gap, and they are usually regarded among the elites: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RicFlair">Ric Flair</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisJericho">Chris Jericho</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KurtAngle">Kurt Angle</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AJStyles">AJ Styles</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EddieGuerrero">Eddie Guerrero</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KanakoUrai">Asuka</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CMPunk">CM Punk</a> come to mind immediately.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StoneColdSteveAustin">"Stunning"/"Stone Cold" Steve Austin</a> was both at different points of his career: As one-half of the Hollywood Blondes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WCW">WCW</a>, he was known as a good technical wrestler and remained that way until he was injured by Owen Hart in 1997.

</li><li> Since its founding, the locker room of Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling was heavily divided between two factions, the "shooters" (most prominently, former boxer Rumi Kazama) and "entertainers" (most prominently Jackie Sato of The Beauty Pair fame), which split the company in two by 1992, the "shooters" going on to found Ladies Legend Pro Wrestling (which became LLPWX) and the "entertainers" continuing the brand legacy with JWP Project (which was then succeeded by JWP Joshi Puroresu, which was then succeeded by Pure J). Tellingly, LLPW's leadership went to judoka and mixed martial arts crossover star Shinobu Kandori(who in fact beat Sato into retirement <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoleEndingMisdemeanor">and left pro wrestling for five years until</a> LLPW's establishment) while JWP's went to the body building <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIronicClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIronicClown">Non-Ironic Clown</a> Command Bolshoi.

</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WWEDivas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Characters/WWEDivas">Divas division</a>, WWE is notorious for pushing performers (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Sable">Sable</a>, Miss Kitty, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TrishStratus">Trish Stratus</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Lita">Lita</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/StacyKeibler">Stacy Keibler</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TorrieWilson">Torrie Wilson</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KellyKelly">Kelly Kelly</a>) over technicians (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Jacqueline">Jacqueline</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MollyHolly">Molly Holly</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CarleneMoore">Jazz</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/GailKim">Gail Kim</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BethPhoenix">Beth Phoenix</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart">Natalya</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Ivory">Ivory</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickieJames">Mickie James</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LisaMarieVaron">Victoria</a> are examples of ones who could go both ways.
</li><li> Similarly we had WCW (technician) vs. WWF (performer) rivalry, epitomized by the two companies' top stars, Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan respectively. Some even blame WWE's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">reluctance</a> (from at least the mid 1990s) to use the phrase "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProfessionalWrestling">Professional Wrestling</a>" on this trope.
</li><li> During the brand extension era, the two main WWE shows — RAW and SmackDown — were based on this dichotomy, with RAW putting more emphasis on storyline and spectacle while SmackDown was seen as the "wrestling" show. Ironically for the women, it was the other way around. RAW was the wrestling show where the Women's title was defended and majority of wrestlers ended up. SmackDown meanwhile had less women, and those it did have were used for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">Fanservice</a>. As of 2016, with the brand split re-instated, it has fallen back into the old divide of SmackDown being a wrestling show and RAW focusing primarily on entertainment.
</li><li> One of WWE's most common tactics is to pair up two less-than-over midcarders in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagTeam">Tag Team</a>; one highly skilled on the mic but with mediocre in-ring ability, and one with great wrestling skills but deficient in character or charisma; so they can conceal each other's weaknesses. One will work the crowd, while the other will do most of the heavy lifting in the ring.
</li><li> Gateway Championship Wrestling had upstart technicians <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HunterJohnston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/HunterJohnston">Delirious</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaizeeHaze" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DaizeeHaze">Daizee Haze</a> against veteran performers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvanBourne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/EvanBourne">Matt Sydal</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MsChif" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MsChif">MsChif</a>. Granted, these were relative cases. Delirious may have been an excellent mat technician with some brawling tendencies but he also wore a mask, constantly babbled and ran around erratically. He was merely the technician because Matt Sydal was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingYourAttacks">an intention announcing</a> acrobatic high flier whose main reason for being a wrestler <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchandiseDriven">was to sell shirts.</a> MsChif was well versed in submission holds and counters. She was the performer because she was also a loud mouth prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness">excessive and often illegal maneuvers</a> while Daizee Haze focused more on moves that ended matches.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NelsonErazo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NelsonErazo">Homicide</a> may have been the technician when he and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/LowKi">Low Ki</a> fought Special K, and in fact was probably the technician vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ColtCabana">Colt Cabana</a>, and in a dual technician's feud with Steve Corino, he and Low Ki being in another case against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SamoaJoe">Samoa Joe</a> and Jay Lethal, to show the latter's growth...but he was the definite performer contrasted to Bryan Danielson. In their first feud Homicide <em>knew</em> he was the inferior technical wrestler and thus decided stabbing Danielson, should the opportunity present itself would be perfectly valid. In their second feud when Homicide was the face it instead became the question of <em>how</em> the performer would find a way to best the superior technician... though fans were perfectly fine with the prospect of Danielson being stabbed after he paid someone to break Homicide's arms.
</li><li> After the fact that EVOLVE didn't have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/DragonGate">Dragon Gate</a> roster, this was the most noticeable difference between it and DG USA, in the beginning anyway. EVOLVE had much more strict rules and was more strict about enforcing them, a rigid ranking system as well as an emphasis on technical wrestling and contrasts of wrestling styles. DG USA was far more relaxed about who could face who, penalties for breaking rules and what even constituted breaking rules in the first place, which a stronger focus on fast paced action between multiple competitors and the faction wars associated with Dragon Gate in general. This largely came to an end as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerStable">power stables</a> from FIP and DG USA (particularly the Premier Athlete Brand) increasingly made their presence felt on EVOLVE shows and were increasingly not punished for it.

</li><li> The Four Horsewomen of NXT became notable partly because they were able to merge these two tropes. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/CharlotteFlair">Charlotte</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Bayley">Bayley</a> were more performers when they started - emphasis on their gimmicks - but worked hard to really improve their wrestling. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/SashaBanks">Sasha Banks</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BeckyLynch">Becky Lynch</a> meanwhile started out as technicians who were solid in the ring but lacked character - only to develop gimmicks of their own and connect with crowds.
</li><li> Behind the scenes, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BellaTwins">Bella Twins</a> commented on merging these two tropes when they were training with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NatalyaNeidhart">Natalya Neidhart</a> in developmental. Nattie was the Technician who helped them with their wrestling. They meanwhile were the Performers, who helped her do "the Diva thing".

Meanwhile <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MercedesMartinez" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MercedesMartinez">Mercedes Martinez</a> has always been a pretty straightforward wrestler, and while she got more vocal over the years she also became less concerned about showing what she could do if a quick win was possible. Nicole Savoy was a suplex enthusiast at first, but when that didn't get her many SHIMMER wins she became a jujitsu fanatic. And Shayna Baszler was determined to return pro wrestling to its "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Catchwrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Catchwrestling">catch</a>" roots(breaking bodies whenever possible).

Martin is a decidedly ungifted pilot who has worked as hard as possible to become a fairly decent one and has literally memorised <em>all</em> the regulations because he feels if he doesn't follow them to the letter anything could happen. As Carolyn puts it "I have a good pilot and a safe pilot. Martin won't let them get into trouble, and if they do, Douglas can get them out of it." Lampshaded in the penultimate episode, when Martin applies for Swiss Air; he gets an "Adequate" on the simulator, but scores 100% on the written exam, which is supposed to be <em>impossible</em>. If Douglas had applied, he'd probably have got a high score on the simulator (assuming he didn't do anything <em>too</em> dramatic), but would barely have bothered thinking about the written questions at all.

<ul><li> Contrast NFL defensive end Reggie White (performer) with Bruce Smith (technician). White is known for his larger-than-life persona, dominance and memorable plays. Smith is simply known for his high numbers and durability. White is easily the more memorable player and almost always ranks higher on lists than Smith.
</li><li> Roughly the difference between New England placekickers Adam Vinatieri (performer with a particular flair for clutch kicks) and Stephen Gostkowski (high-scoring technician with a major, but often unnoticed impact on team performance over multiple seasons). Apart from a brief stretch in 2010 and the injury-marred kicker carousel of 2019, the Pats have only had two placekickers on the roster since 1996, and they're both among the greatest at the position. Gostkowski, in particular, is the franchise leader in scoring, has helped bring the Pats to six Super Bowls, and has played a major factor in keeping the team in championship contention more or less continuously between 2009 and 2019. However, despite Gostkowski's greater percentage of regular season and playoff field goals made, his powerful leg and his consistency over a longer career at New England, his high profile missed PAT and field goal kicks (a crucial missed PAT cost the Pats a chance to go to Super Bowl 50 by way of an unsuccessful last minute 2-pt play; a missed PAT in Super Bowl LI forced the Pats to convert 2-pt plays twice just to tie the game; a missed field goal and PAT in Super Bowl LII; a missed field goal in Super Bowl LIII) form a compelling contrast to Vinatieri's postseason heroics (the two kicks in a blizzard during the 2001 Divisional vs. Oakland; game-winning last minute kicks in Super Bowls XXXVI and XXXVIII, a crucial and ultimately game-winning field goal in Super Bowl XXXIX) and leave him with a complicated legacy.

</li></ul></li><li> Among point guards, the passionate, flashy Steve Nash was a relatively poor defender leading a fast-paced, high-scoring offense with creative passing and scoring; the reserved Jason Kidd wasn't a terrific scorer, but played excellent defense and distributed the ball beautifully.

</li></ul></li><li> Teammate example: Klay Thompson (a tall guard with textbook-perfect shooting mechanics and steady post moves, described by his teammates as acting the same whether he's made 10 shots or missed 10) vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/StephenCurry">Stephen Curry</a> (a smaller guard with <a class="urllink" href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/10703246/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-reinventing-shooting-espn-magazine">an unorthodox but deadly shot,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a broad repertoire of high-risk, no-look passes, and a habit of enthusiastic on-court celebrations).
</li><li> The 2017 MVP race pitted Russell Westbrook (a flashy on-court performer with a penchant for attempting high-risk plays and padding box score stats) against James Harden (who specialized in running an efficient offense) and Kawhi Leonard (an elite defensive stopper). Westbrook won the MVP despite leading his team to fewer wins, and losing quickly in the first round of the playoffs.
</li></ul></li><li> Pittsburgh Steelers (technician) vs Dallas Cowboys (performer).
</li><li> In the past, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">tennis</a> had Andre Agassi (performer) vs. Pete Sampras (technician), at least on the outside. Agassi loathed the game of tennis (at least according to his autobiography <em>Open</em>), while Sampras was happy to sleep, eat and breathe the sport and merely lacked Agassi's natural charisma.
<ul><li> There was also John McEnroe (performer) vs. Ivan Lendl (technician). Not everyone loved McEnroe due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">abrasive personality</a> but everyone could be counted on to have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveToHate">some</a></em> kind of strong emotional reaction to him and he was the definite crowd favorite against Lendl, who had a more successful career overall than McEnroe with a positive head-to-head record against him and more Grand Slams and weeks at No. 1 to his name but was viewed by many as a personality-devoid "Czech robot" to such an extent that Sports Illustrated once described him as "The Champion No One Cares About". It's also arguably the main reason for McEnroe being typically ranked above Lendl in "greatest tennis players of all time" lists in spite of Lendl spending more time than him at the top of the game because his playing style and wins were considered to be more dynamic and exciting to watch than Lendl's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">Boring, but Practical</a> consistency.
</li><li> The fact that Johnny Mac was an American and Lendl wasn't helps too when deciding who the American public will cheer for.
</li><li> The passionate and fiery Jimmy Connors (performer) vs. the "Iceman" Björn Borg (technician).
</li></ul></li><li> The artistic Barry Sanders (performer) vs. the consistent Emmitt Smith (technician).
</li><li> Calvin Johnson (performer) vs. Larry Fitzgerald (technician).
</li><li> Many quarterback examples. A few notable ones:
<ul><li> Dan Marino (record-setting technician) vs. Joe Montana (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a>-winning performer).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeytonManning">Peyton Manning</a> (cerebral, record-setting technician) vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBrady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBrady">Tom Brady</a> (performer with a winner's mentality). Interestingly, Brady has become more of a technician in the last few years.
</li><li> Eli Manning also has this dynamic with his older brother Peyton.
</li><li> Brett Favre (performer) vs. Aaron Rodgers (technician). Favre had an extremely strong throwing arm and would take risks for big plays. At times, he led the league in passing yards, touchdown passes and interceptions <em>all at the same time.</em> Rodgers, Favre's successor in the Packers, has a masterful command of the playbook and the positions of his receivers, and is the most <em>accurate</em> passer in the league, with the highest career passer rating and touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history. Both are considered among the greatest quarterbacks of their respective generations, and both have Super Bowl rings.
</li><li> From the 70s, Terry Bradshaw (performer) vs Roger Staubach (technician).
</li></ul></li><li> While baseball's measured pace and tendency towards staid decorum tends to breed more technicians, there are some examples (particularly among pitchers, who get the most opportunity to put their personal stamp on games).
<ul><li> Tim Lincecum and Roy Halladay, probably the two best pitchers of the late 2000s-early teens. <a class="urllink" href="http://joeposnanski.com/joeblogs/halladay-and-lincecum/">This column from Joe Posnanski<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is essentially a discussion of this trope, and even their nicknames - the unorthodox, improvisational "Freak" vs. the stone-faced, surgically precise "Doc Halladay" - fit.
</li><li> The two best pitchers of the 90s also fit. Greg Maddux, who consistently defeated hitters despite a limited fastball with better command than any pitcher of the modern age and a <a class="urllink" href="http://deadspin.com/as-greg-maddux-stories-go-this-is-a-hard-on-to-top-1497594282">prenatural ability to analyze games<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, was the technician; Pedro Martínez, who threw a dazzling array of pitches and was famously demonstrative and feisty on the mound, was the performer.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3zwe9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3zwe9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3zwe9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Interestingly, both were undervalued prospects, considered too small to ever really succeed as major-league pitchers.</span>
</li><li> The Yankees and Red Sox teams of the 2000s were essentially very similar, but their respective superstars fit this - Derek Jeter (a defender with limited range but steady hands, who had one of the most textbook inside-out swings baseball has ever seen) vs Manny Ramirez (a theatrical, unpredictable fielder and a "mad genius" of hitting.)
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a>, Ayrton Senna (performer) vs Alain Prost (technician). From an earlier era, James Hunt (performer) vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NikiLauda">Niki Lauda</a> (technician). In more recent years, we have Lewis Hamilton (technician) vs Sebastian Vettel (performer).
<ul><li> Actually, given Senna's level of dedication to physical training and car testing, it's difficult to place him easily in either category. Nigel Mansell, who in testing would 'set a lap, then bugger off to the golf course', Jean Alesi, and Ronnie Peterson, who drove his team leader mad by being so completely able to instinctively adapt to a car's mangled setup and thus unable to provide any feedback, are more fitting examples of performers.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">The World Cup</a>, historically the South American teams are the Performers and the European ones the Technicians, with Brazil and Germany being the best examples of each respectively.
<ul><li> This South AmericanEuropean dynamic holds true to some extent on the women's side. Brazilian icon Marta has filled both roles at the same time. Asian sides (plus Australia, which now plays within the Asian football structure) are mostly technicians, though current Australia star Sam Kerr has many "performer" aspects. The team with the most wins in the women's edition, the USA, is capable of playing either role as needed. And sometimes both, with the iconic 1999 team as just one example.
</li></ul></li><li> Partially true in modern roller derby; while it is very much a sport, and if you can't keep up technically you will be cut from the team, rollergirls are also strongly encouraged to play to the crowd.
</li><li> In the English <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EquestrianSports" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EquestrianSports">equestrian world</a>: Showjumpers (performers) versus Hunter-Jumpers (technicians). The rivalry is — intense, as showjumpers yell that hunters are robotic and too focused on minutiae, while hunters wail that jumpers care more about leaping ridiculously high fences than they do about correct equitation. (From someone who has ridden both — both sides have a point.)
</li><li> In Alpine Ski Racing, Bode Miller, despite having cleaned up his 'rockstar' behaviour from a couple of years ago, still skis with a far less pretty and orthodox technique compared to other giants such as Didier Cuche. But *my god* the man is fast...
</li><li> Boxing is a sport where technicians and performers can equally shine. Regardless of which type of fighter they are, everything else being equal, it will almost always be the fighter with the most varied and complete skills set that wins the fight, be they a performer or technician.
<ul><li> Roy Jones Jr. (performer) vs. Bernard Hopkins (technician)

</li><li> Among old-timey goaltenders: Charlie Gardiner (performer) vs. George Hainsworth (technician)
</li></ul></li><li> Football: Real Madrid (technician) vs. FC Barcelona (performer).
<ul><li> Ironic, considering how Barcelona's performance value comes from their mastering the technical side. Barcelona's equivalents in the UK, Arsenal, are definitely considered the technicians (witness Arsène Wenger's nickname, "The Professor") to Manchester United's performers. As of late, among the Premier League's Big Six we have Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United as the technicians, and Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City as the performers.
</li><li> Barcelona's <em>tiki-taka</em> style of play (and its predecessor, the Dutch Total Football) is based on extreme technical skill on a personal level while the tactical flow of the team as a whole is more loose. What results is a team whose individual players are Technicians but the team as a whole is a Performer.
</li><li> One could roughly compare FC Barcelona and Real Madrid to Maverick and Iceman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TopGun">Top Gun</a></em> respectively: FC Barcelona plays a spectacular possession and attacking game, showing incredible talent and skills and always aiming to appeal the public, while Real Madrid plays a strategical counter attacking tactic that relies on a solid defense, then exploiting their opponents' flaws, what they do almost perfectly.
</li><li> The 2017-18 Serie A season showed this confrontation once again between title contenders Juventus and Napoli. Six-time consecutive title winners Juventus are the technicians, with their manager, Massimiliano Allegri, favoring tactical versatility and emphasizing each player's traits to win matches even when they don't perform at their best. Napoli, instead, are definitely the performers: their manager, Maurizio Sarri, almost always goes with the same players and rarely pulls off turnovers; however, when they win, they dominate the match front, back and center with mesmerizing plays and a devastating attacking verve. Even though Juventus won their seventh consecutive title with one match to spare despite their last-minute defeat at home against Napoli, the latter have gotten the approval of football fans everywhere in the world not just for their spectacular plays, but also for coming the closest a team has ever gotten to snatch the Serie A title away from the Old Lady in 7 years. This contrast also showed itself later in the season to a lesser extent with Champions league zone contenders Inter Milan (technicians) and Roma (performers).
</li></ul></li><li> Figure skating in general. The best can find a balance between crowd-pleasing performance and technical precision, but many struggle and veer too far one way or the other. In the worst cases, it either becomes just an entertaining show and not a sport, or it's technically perfect but emotionless and boring to watch.
<ul><li> The 1992 Winter Olympics women's figure skating event was billed as "the artists (Kristi Yamaguchi and Nancy Kerrigan) vs. the athletes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyaHarding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TonyaHarding">Tonya Harding</a> and Midori Ito). The first two women were remarkably elegant and graceful skaters, but they could not land a triple Axel jump, while the latter women could.
</li><li> By the 1994 games, it was Nancy Kerrigan in the "athlete" role, with Oksana Baiul as the "artist".
</li><li> 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics, men's figure skating free skate: Ilia Kulik (<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhPlfpz5fEQ">technician<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) vs. Philippe Candeloro (performer— <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_CE2mONanE">and how!<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)
</li><li> 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, the controversy over the men's singles figure skating gold medal. Charismatic performer Evgeni Plushenko who <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtY1CuAbLgs">skated a higher risk program which is filled with small errors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, versus collected technician Evan Lysacek who <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmJgGHIoawU">skated clean on a lower risk program<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The 2017 U.S. Figure Skating Champions, Nathan Chen v. most of the other contenders. Chen landed <em>five quads</em> in his free skate, but emotionally his programs have been criticized as boring and passionless; compare Jason Brown, who took the bronze, who could not even remotely match the amount of points Chen racked up but skated a fun, spin-filled program to music from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton">Hamilton</a></em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Artistic gymnastics (especially on the women's side) too, since gymnasts have to be both technicians and performers to some degree. On balance beam and floor exercise in particular, it's a requirement that gymnasts perform creative and artistic routines rather than "a series of disconnected elements". They've gone through at least three different scoring systems in the last twenty years to try and address this dichotomy. The current system, with its increased emphasis on a predetermined difficulty value, strongly favours technicians; many fans have <a class="urllink" href="https://slate.com/culture/2012/07/2012-olympics-gymnastics-female-gymnasts-used-to-be-fantastic-dancers-how-did-the-floor-exercise-get-so-graceless.html">complained that<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> doing difficult skills has taken precedence over artistry, noting that gymnasts like <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioOMPzjbtIA">Laurie Hernandez<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWgus46ZY1Q">Brooklyn Moors<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, though they excel in choreography and artistry, come in at a disadvantage to their competitors with less artistry in their choreography but more difficulty in their elements; they can score high enough to get into finals, but often are not top medal contenders.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4swxy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4swxy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4swxy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">For the record, the biggest deduction a gymnast can get for lack of artistry — and therefore the biggest advantage a gymnast with perfect artistry can gain over one without — is half a point, and that's if the latter gets <em>every single possible</em> artistry deduction. A top technician (i.e. a fairly clean power tumbler) can make that up relatively easily in difficulty score over a performer who can't match those power elements.</span>
<ul><li> However, this is not an absolute binary; there are gymnasts who are capable of being both. Runaway superstar of women's gymnastics Simone Biles, on <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hPYtc9XW3A">floor exercise<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in particular, can not only do incredible difficulty (why, yes, that <em>is</em> a triple double she's throwing), and well-executed difficulty at that, but also really performs the choreography (rather than just going through the motions, as many gymnasts have been accused of doing) and plays to the crowd, making her routines fun to watch.
</li></ul></li><li> The Beijing vs London Olympic Games Opening Ceremonies have drawn this comparison, with Beijing painted as a spectacular but somehow soulless demonstration of state power (technician) and London as a less showy but more heartfelt show of the quirkiness of Britain (performer).
</li><li> Snooker: The 1985 world championship final between Steve Davis (technician) and Dennis Taylor (performer), the contrast highlighted by it also being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheBrink">Back from the Brink</a> win for the performer. Later on, the 90s rivalry between Stephen Hendry (technician) and Jimmy White (performer).
</li><li> This happened at the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup when Tahiti (Performer) competed against all other teams of its group, especially Spain (Technician). Sure, the Tahitians lost each match, but it didn't really bother them, since their goal was to enjoy the tournament, and as a bonus, they won the crowd too.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a>:
<ul><li> Randy Couture (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldGuy">Cool Old Guy</a> who had to rely on guile and tactics to make up for his age) vs. Chuck Liddell (brawling knockout artist) are a prime example. Couture won the first fight, but the loss forced Liddell to become more technical himself, after which he managed to beat Couture twice.
</li><li> Two faces of the UFC in the early 2010s: Georges St-Pierre (technically impeccable wrestler) and Anderson Silva (counter striker with some showboating tendencies).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/KazushiSakuraba">Kazushi Sakuraba</a> (performer) vs. the Gracie family (all technicians).
</li></ul></li><li> Rugby union: England (Technician) vs. France (Performer) is known as "Le Crunch", and is one of the biggest matches between Northern Hemisphere teams. The French national rugby union team is renowned for its "French flair" where the players can score tries out of nowhere (in fact, one of its most famous tries is remembered as the "try from the end of the world"), compared to the other Northern Hemisphere teams who play a more pragmatic style (especially England). While the French haven't had as much success in the Six (formerly Five) Nations or Rugby World Cup as England have, and also have a losing record against England, they're still more successful than any other Six Nations side; they have more wins against New Zealand than every other Northern Hemisphere side put together, and have also reached as many World Cup finals as England have (although unlike England, they failed to win any). It's said that "you never know which France will turn up" for any given match. When French flair was abandoned under coach Philippe Saint-André,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note580r3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note580r3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note580r3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who, in his playing days, started the attack that ended in the "try from the end of the world"</span> it resulted in one of the worst eras of French rugby, picking up a wooden spoon in the 2013 Six Nations and suffering the heaviest ever World Cup knockout stage defeat (13-62) against New Zealand.

Tends to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inverted</a> though, because wizards end up with much more versatility, learn spells sooner, and easier access to metamagic feats.
<ul><li> Fifth edition retains the same flavor, but plays it much straighter in actual practice. Wizards know a lot more spells, but can only alter them in very static and consistent ways, while sorcerers know a smaller number of spells but possess a separate point system that allows them to alter them on the fly while casting them instead of having to learn a different version of the spell separately. The statistics of a typical sorcerer also make it much easier for them to alter the effective impact of their spells with bluffs or fast-talk at the target and to effectively use the most flexible spells like illusions.
</li><li> Other similarly built classes share the distinction such as Fighter (technician) vs Barbarian (performer), Bard (performer) vs Rogue (technician), Paladin (technician) vs Cleric (performer), and Druid (performer) vs Ranger (technician).
</li><li> From a more meta perspective, there's making a character to fit an interesting concept or theme with perhaps less-than-optimal performance (Performer) vs. making a character that mechanically is as powerful as possible with roleplaying and story taking a backseat (Technician).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerArchetypes">Player Archetypes</a> have the "Timmy" type as the performer and the "Spike" type as the technician. Timmies play to have fun and make "big things" happen, and Spikes play to win. The third archetype, Johnny, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedMage">splits the difference</a>; While Johnny plays to create new decks, interesting combos and never-before-seen card interactions, though not necessarily to win, <em>some</em> knowledge of the rules is required to ensure that those crazy ideas actually <em>work</em>.
</li><li> Alternatively, one could consider it a spectrum. At the far end of the Technician scale, we have Spike, who bases his decks off of pure tactics, often using predetermined strategies or copying the best in the game in order to make a powerful deck. Next is Johnny, who still focuses on power, but tends to try and experiment to create new combos and new abilities as he does so. Third is Timmy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">who doesn't care about technical power but just wants to make big stuff happen</a>.
</li><li> In-universe, the Blue vs. Red conflict is Technician vs. Performer. Blue tends to be coldly logical, focused on victory through precision, control, and superior information, usually whittling down an opponent's ability to fight back; Red is the colour of emotion and impulse, and tends to win with big spectacular displays like hails of thunderbolts, massive fireballs, swarms of goblins or the unleashing of a dragon.

</div><ul><li> And finally when it comes to the cards themselves, we have the dichotomy between Vorthos (Performer) and Melvin (Technician). Vorthos is all about the "flavor", the story the cards are telling. Some Vorthos are far more interested in the artwork on the cards then they are in the game itself! Melvins, by contrast, are all about the rules and mechanics of the game. They might not even be aware of the story the cards are telling at all, and the artwork serves as little more than a visual reminder of which card is which. The difference can be best summed up with the go-to example cards for Vorthos and Melvin, <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=form+of+the+dragon">Form of the Dragon<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126156">Mystic Speculation.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> Two of the three abilities of Form of the Dragon are wildly out of flavor in Red on their own (attack denial and direct life total manipulation, respectively) until you step back and realize that when combined they <em>actually turn the player into a flying, fire-breathing dragon</em>.
</li><li> Mystic Speculation, meanwhile, has almost no flavor to speak of but from a rules standpoint accomplishes a fair bit of versatility in only two keywords, Scry and Buyback. Most other cards need <em>at least</em> three words, and even then the list of such cards is fairly short.
</li><li> And just to put the cherry on it, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedOniBlueOni">Form of the Dragon is Red while Mystic Speculation is Blue.</a>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em> armies tend to lend themselves to one side other the other during gameplay. Armies with fewer but individually more capable units, such as the Space Marines, Eldar, Dark Eldar, and Chaos are more Performers; their versatility allows for wildly different forces from the same race to be equally as effective in the hands of a capable player. Armies with more but less unique units like the Imperial Guard, Orkz, Necrons, Tyrannids, and Tau generally win more often when they adhere to a strict set of tactics for each situation, and are more Technicians. Of course, the huge size of the setting allows for much internal variation, so it is possible to see one army or another slide towards one end or the other.
</li><li> In the world of hobby boardgaming, people often talk about a rough division between "Eurogames" and "Ameritrash." Eurogames tend to be on the Technician side of the equation, emphasizing play mechanics and balance over theme and production; notable games in this category include <em>Caylus</em>, <em>Agricola</em>, <em>Le Havre</em>, and many abstract strategy games. Ameritrash games, which tend to focus on presentation, theme, and character ahead of mechanical concerns, are usually Performers. Think of games like <em>Dungeonquest</em>, <em>Talisman</em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CosmicEncounter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/CosmicEncounter">Cosmic Encounter</a></em>. The term Ameritrash originally arose to denigrate that style of gaming after the rise of the Eurogame; now it's often used as a general label and not a statement of quality, as many Ameritrash games are really well-made and fun. And, of course, there's a great deal of cross-over between the two categories.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em>: Ryu and Ken. To elaborate, Ryu is something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedCompetitor">Spirited Competitor</a> mixture whose main purpose in life is to perfect his fighting skill and have the perfect match. In that sense, his fighting style is in its purest form and therefore does more damage without the focus on flash. Ken, on the other hand, is a showy combatant with a focus on fast kicks and punches and only cares about winning and putting on a good show. In this sense, Ken is more combo oriented and therefore, while not as damaging as Ryu's, his moves do a lot of damage if comboed into. This is best showcased in the UDON comic, where Ryu and Ken are both studying the Dragon Punch: Ken, with his natural abilities, gets the basic gist of the move, pulls it off perfectly and then throws some fire on it and calls it a day; Ryu on the other hand, continues to practice that one basic attack over and over with no variance in form or routine. In the end, Ryu ends up with a stronger, harder-hitting Dragon Punch while Ken winds up with a weaker but flashier one supported by other unique attacks and combos.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWars">Sakura Wars</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWarsSoLongMyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SakuraWarsSoLongMyLove">So Long, My Love</a></em> plays it straight in the fifth act when protagonist Shinjiro has to take Subaru's place on stage after losing a contest to them. Subaru is the ultimate technician, while Shinjiro is the ultimate performer. Subaru also has a similar moment when she first tries to play Jazz music at a club. While she is technically proficient, it takes her a while to understand the performance aspect of the genre.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFury">Fatal Fury</a></em>'s Kim Kaphwan and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheKingOfFighters">The King of Fighters</a></em>' Jhun Hoon. Kim is a very traditional Tae Kwon Do practitioner and his moves, while pretty flashy themselves, are fairly traditional and get the job done. Jhun Hoon, Kim's rival since childhood, is very much pure flash: he fights with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremityExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremityExtremist">only his feet</a> (Kim has two/three punches) and kicks out ki phoenix talons (someting Kim doesn't do). He also has a very flamboyant aura about himself and is obviously very showy with his moveset, while Kim shows off a little less in exchange for being more reliable.
<ul><li> The Bogard brothers, too. Andy is a serious-minded and very focused individual who strives to be a well-rounded fighter while Terry has a more lax attitude, just looking for a good match and relying on his natural talents. Unfortunately this puts Andy into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">Hard Work Hardly Works</a> situation because in addition to being the "performer" of their duo, Terry is also <em>the better fighter</em>. Andy's efforts to become a great fighter are surpassed by Terry's pragmatic and naturalistic fighting style, which can leave him a bit down on himself despite his affection and respect for his older brother.
</li><li> Kim's sons from <em>Garou: Mark of the Wolves</em>: Jae Hoon and Dong Hwan. Jae Hoon is his father's son through and through, using his dad's staple moves (but with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncendiaryExponent">Incendiary Exponent</a>) and having the same stern attitude on training and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DetectEvil">evildoers</a>. Meanwhile his brother is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> sibling, who uses a more individualized take on TKD that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">injects some electricity</a> for the contrast, preferring to show off, self-aggrandize, and rely on natural talent during battle.

The Ramen Don's ordinary but very tasty and masterfully made Ramen is being ignored in favor of the mediocre, yet flashy and crowd pleasing Shadow Ramen, and Neku and Joshua work to reverse this by getting the celebrity supporter to try the "plain" Ramen and therefore support Ramen Don. Although in this case, Ramen Don is a guy who loves his Ramen, where as Shadow Ramen just views it in terms of cold hard cash, and this subplot is about integrity and doing whats right, not what looks good. It's also played straight with the characters of Shooter and Yammer. Yammer himself says he's more technical, but Shooter has more heart so he wins all the matches.
<ul><li> Shooter and Yammer are parodies, they parody this trope along with other cliche'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shonen">Shōnen</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a> tropes.

<ul><li> In general, Yu Suzuki has shown himself to be a technician as a game developer, which is especially evident with his most ambitious project <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shenmue">Shenmue</a></em>, an extremely graphically detailed and expansive open world game. Suzuki's body of work can be compared to fellow SEGA game designer Toshihiro Nagoshi, the performer. Nagoshi has produced games like <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMonkeyBall">Super Monkey Ball</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaytonaUSA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DaytonaUSA">Daytona USA</a></em>, remembered not only for their nostalgia values, but how engaging and fun they were. On top of that, he's also the producer of the acclaimed story-driven <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Yakuza">Yakuza</a></em> series, which is seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <em>Shenmue</em>, but had a less strict development cycle overall.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> vs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tekken">Tekken</a></em>. <em>Street Fighter</em> is the 'technician' role, a game largely focused on trying to balance characters, but its very difficult to get into 'casually' vs Tekken, the performer, a fighter game which is easy to play but has fewer special moves. Though considering that the 'Technician' here has spectacular special attacks and characters shoot fireballs, while the performer is focused largely on hand to hand combat, the lines can be blurred. There's going to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntercontinuityCrossover">two-game crossover series</a> according to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a>, with one game built on each engine.
<ul><li> Tekken is more realistic in terms of the way the characters fight. Although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fireballs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fireballs">fireballs</a> are present, they haven't been that common in recent years. Many people believe Street Fighter's retro appeal is the only reason it remains so popular, as it has not made use of technology like Tekken has. They did try with the Ex series, but it didn't work that well.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighter">Street Fighter</a></em> (<em>again</em>) as the technician vs <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat">Mortal Kombat</a></em> as the performer. The contrast between both franchises can be illustrated with their grand returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StreetFighterIV">Street Fighter IV</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MortalKombat9">Mortal Kombat 9</a></em>: both were highly acclaimed by critics and players, the former for its deep, competitive gameplay system, the latter for its visuals, detailed storyline and several game modes.
</li><li> Yuri and Flynn's fighting styles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em> can be distinguished in this way, as discussed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixyiu7Qizds">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In story, the explanation is given that they were trained in the same style but while Flynn perfected his skills, Yuri chose to add his own flair, causing them to diverge. Gameplay-wise, this maifests as Flynn using many of the classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a></em> sword artes with sharp, precise movements, while Yuri moves in a flashier, more fluid way and combines original artes with variations on the classics.
<ul><li> This trope also applies to their cooking abilities: Flynn has skill, Yuri has talent. Though unlike in fighting, where their differing approaches are treated as equally valid, Yuri is very clearly the more competent one in the kitchen. Though this is because Flynn's skill cannot compensate for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CordonBleughChef">Cordon Bleugh Chef</a> status, especially with his idea of what tastes good. The result is usually over spiced <em>at best</em>. Yuri does have a good sense of taste and applies it to how he cooks.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfSymphonia">another game from the series</a>, Kratos and Zelos have similar artes, but Kratos is the Technician to Zelos' Performer.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has this distinction between the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusEnvironment">PvE</a> (technician) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerVersusPlayer">PvP</a> (performer) crowds. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> players often spend their time memorizing spell/ability rotations and managing buffs/debuffs over a fight while working a specific role (Tanking boss damage, dealing damage, or healing other party members), while the much more chaotic PvP depends more on the players essentially improvising. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> boss encounter back from the <em>Wrath</em> days re-created PvP conditions as you faced a squad of enemies from the opposing faction in battle. It benefitted from using PvP gear and mechanics, which caused a lot of consternation in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> community.
<ul><li> The same may be said of MMORPGs in general, although how much the "Multiplayer" part of the acronym is enforced in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a> throughout any given game will greatly determine where any given player lies on this scale. Within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PvE">PvE</a>, a Technician may be the player who plays primarily in highly organized groups and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BribingYourWayToVictory">spends a fortune giving his/her character top-of-the-line gear</a>, and who has little to no tolerance for new players or anything that might interfere with dungeon-crawling or other in-game activities that require groups. The Performer, on the other hand, will know what to do when and have decent (but not supreme) gear for his/her character's level, but is generally much more tolerant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickUpGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PickUpGroup">Pick-Up Group</a> and will keep the "fun" factor in the dungeon- or event-run by methods including but not limited to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PreAssKickingOneLiner">taunting AI-controlled enemies in the group-chat channel</a> in order to give the group a good laugh.

Kazooie has greater agility and speed and always tries to show off herself as possible when she engages her foes, fitting her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Deadpan Snarker</a> attitude. Banjo is focused on his strength and power and is very skilled at self defence with various techniques at his disposal, being a big brawny bear. Whoever is better at combat is very much something of a debate between them both, but they really are considered equals.
</li><li> Dive (Technician) and Kick (Performer) from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Divekick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Divekick">Divekick</a></em> are unusual examples in that <em>both</em> of them neglect their divekick practice, but Kick has natural talent while Dive applies his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadMathematician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadMathematician">math skills</a> to his divekicking instead.
</li><li> An example from e-sports: in professional <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dota2">Dota2</a></em> play, North American and European teams tend to lean towards being performers, while Asian teams tend to favor being technicians.

Delthea is the performer who is naturally gifted with magic, but doesn't really care to refine herself since she's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrilliantButLazy">Brilliant, but Lazy</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToBeNormal">just wants to have a normal life</a>.

ARS is the technician, favoring a simpler set of rotation physics that are more rigid but simpler to understand generally result in faster runs, while SRS is the performer, with a more lenient and flashy rotation physics that allow for wilder twists (up to and including the infamous T-Spin Triple) and easier recoveries but often a slower performance (hence why in Shirase mode, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimedMission">time checkpoints</a> for SRS are looser).

Zuko uses showy fire attacks and a lot of jumping, kicks and flips, whereas Azula's fire and movements are tightly controlled, economical and directed. This is inverted come the series finale however. When Zuko temporarily loses his firebending, he and Aang go to rediscover a forgotten style powered by passion and liveliness (taught by a lost tribe of Firebenders) and it's flat-out stated that this is how Firebending actually is compared to the anger and hatred driven style it is now, thus allowing Zuko to become a much better bender.

Zuko manages to take advantage of this and very nearly beats Azula had she not tried a sneak attack against Katara, who was spectating at the time.
<ul><li> And as demonstrated in the immediate follow-up to the above scene, a similar contrast can also be made between Azula and Katara herself, both being prodigies in their respective elements. As opposed to Azula's practiced and perfected technique and above-mentioned mental instability, Katara's bending is fluid, efficient, and driven by her emotions, such as flaring out of control when angry or in defense of her friends. In an interesting twist, however, while relatively skilled on her own merits, she wasn't as much of an expert in the first season when she relied on her feelings alone, and as such had to learn specific techniques from the Northern Water Tribe to help her gain a better understanding of her element. So while her emotional drive is a key factor, it's a combination of skill <em>and</em> passion that makes her bending so effective, allowing her to subdue a rampaging Azula with relative ease.

The result is that Huey gets the internship for all his hard work, but Dewey gets a much better VP position for no other reason than owning a briefcase. This is actually discussed by Dewey in his pep-talk shortly afterward, telling Huey that while everyone is drawn to and impressed by the performers, it's the technicians' hard work that make the performer's role possible.
<ul><li> A later episodes focusing on Huey and Violet competing for the position of Senior Junior Woodchuck once again puts Huey in the technician role, following the step by step instructions of the the group's guidebook to earn merit badges at official troop events, while Violet is the performer, focusing on the group's overarching principles rather than the nitty gritty details and applying them to the real world to earn her badges.

<ul><li> Rainbow Dash (performer) vs. Fluttershy (technician). Rainbow loves to show off and create flashy moves, while Fluttershy simply relies on hard work and grit. Both obviously has her fans, so the writers seem careful not to favor one over the other.
</li><li> Pinkie Pie and Rarity have similar parallels. Both are charismatic people-ponies with Pinkie Pie being naturally cheerful, friendly, and full of a desire to make others smile (performer) and Rarity cultivating her image, deliberately networking to grow her social circle, and using her craft to make a name for herself (technician).
</li><li> Twilight Sparkle and Applejack do have similar parallels as well. Both have extensive knowledge of their respective fields, magic and farming, respectively. But while Twilight's knowledge comes from years of intense study and research (techincian), Applejack's comes from years of practical experience (performer).

Faulkner wrote in a variety of styles while Hemingway only wrote in one, Faulkner wrote both short stories and novels, while Hemingway wrote mostly short stories and only a few complete novels. On the other hand, Faulkner was known for being very self-effacing while Hemingway gloried in being a public celebrity and known name.
</li><li> Columnist John Derbyshire once said that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Deep Blue vs Kasparov </a> match was really between a "toolmaker" (technician) represented by the program, and a "virtuoso" (performer) represented by Gary Kasparov.
</li><li> Also on the subject of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a>, two World Champions: Mikhail Tal (performer) and Tigran Petrosian (technician). Tal was known for wildly speculative sacrifices leading to incredibly active and complex positions; even if later analysis showed the sacrifices to be flawed, it was difficult for even the best opponents to refute them over the board. "Chess, first of all, is art," said Tal. Meanwhile Petrosian was known for setting up rock-solid defenses and waiting for the opponent to make the slightest of mistakes, and then systematically demolishing them. Responding to criticism of his style, Petrosian said "They say my games should be more 'interesting'. I could be more 'interesting'and also lose." (In case you were wondering, Petrosian has the slight edge in his lifetime record against Tal, 22½19½.)
</li><li> Garri Kasparovs dynamic, active playing style and Anatoly Karpov's positional "Boa Constrictor" squared off in 1984 FIDE world championship. It had to be terminated after 48 games unresolved because the players' health was in risk due to strain.
</li><li> The traditional Mac/PC rivalry revolved around this, with Microsoft as the technician and Apple as the performer. In the last decade or so, however, the rivalry has cooled, and both now straddle the technician/performer divide. Somewhat ironic, since in internal design, they are arguably the opposite: Apple OS is the tightly-defined technician, with one tried and tested app for each function, whereas Windows is the more adaptable but sloppier performer.
</li><li> Browsers tend to emphasise either customizability and power <em>or</em> a streamlined user interface. The release of Google Chrome in 2008 set off a trend of smooth, lightweight browsers: compare, for example, Opera Presto and its vast array of built-in features (technician) with the newer Opera Chromium, which is much faster but has abandoned all but the most basic options (performer).
</li><li> Victor Davis Hanson described the Battle of Waterloo this way saying that Wellington was more like a technician and Napoleon was like a performer. As he was rooting for Wellington it was kind of an inversion.
</li><li> US Navy (Technician) vs Imperial Japanese Navy (Performer) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>. The technicians won this one, largely because of better strategic intelligence and battle-action, even during the early years of the war when they were often outnumbered, as well as paying attention to little details such as damage control and training regimen. Meanwhile, the Japanese paid little attention to anything that wasn't necessary in maintaining combat performance, as well as relying on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a> for many of it's combat actions; this resulted in blunders like Pearl Harbor (which did very little harm but angered the US enough for it to respond), kamikaze attacks (a massive waste of things the Japanese were, at that point, very short of, which were good airplanes and pilots), and the sinking of Taiho (which was because of poor damage control).
</li><li> The El Alamein campaigns stands out: Rommel (performer) versus Montgomery (technician). Rommel was a tactical genius with a penchant for risky but brilliant maneuver warfare, conducted on a shoestring logistical line; Montgomery was excellent at organization and attention to detail, arranging for every shell to reach its destination. In a inversion, Montgomery won. Second El Alamein was not known for British maneuver genius but for meticulously-planned attacks that smashed through Rommel's depleted lines; Rommel had no fuel to maneuver with thanks to British air attacks, while Montgomery's staff had even forecast the length of the battle successfully. Basically, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics">Rommel was at his best when other people were handling the operational level of war (confining him to tactics, something he was actually good at) and Montgomery was best at the operational level (having prevented his subordinates from exercising too much imagination in their tactics).</a>
</li><li> The entire chain of political events which ended in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> could be understood as the battle between the logic of a Technician and that of a Performer, while the former was the Soviet Union and the latter the community of Fascist states. If anything, the Communists were absolute maniacs of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharlesAtlasSuperpower">discipline and gain by struggle</a>: they won the Russian Civil War by the skin of their teeth, developed the heavy industry and military forces of the USSR by iron hand, oppression, death and poverty, won <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarTwo">World War II</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">by the force of numbers</a>, imitated to the point that Soviet cars, trucks, buildings or fridges were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Munchkin">carbon copies of American designs</a>, only because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">they were so determined to gain visible results</a> that took the easier way by copying what worked, regardless of having understood the culture behind it or not. On the other side, the entire Fascist culture, from Benito Mussolini in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringTwenties">the 1920s</a> to the end, revolved around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">coolness</a>, elaborate design, color, music, innovation, staging, up to the point of being a gigantic theatrical performance instead of true Machiavellian politics. They played straight the trope, as modern people are far more impressed by cool tanks, uniforms and heroic deeds of the losers instead of the anonymous labor and toil of the winners. It says something that what many people instinctively think of when they think of the Nazis is state-sponsored propaganda produced <em>by the Nazis</em> (e.g. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TriumphOfTheWill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TriumphOfTheWill">Triumph of the Will</a></em>).

</div></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeChordsAndTheTruth">central ethos of punk rock</a> is that of the performer, bringing it to swift popularity in a musical landscape dominated by the prog rock technicians who dominated contemporary rock music.
</li><li> The trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVsWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldierVsWarrior">Soldier vs. Warrior</a> incorporates the basic elements behind this trope. A soldier (Technician) trains to fight as part of a team, drilling and practicing to become part of an organised unit. A warrior (Performer), on the other hand, is a much better fighter individually, but is undisciplined and fights alone. The Roman Empire vs The Celts during the conquest of Britain is a good example of this; in open fields with plenty of space, the Romans fought as one and overwhelmed the Celts with superior equipment, training and discipline, but when they were forced to fight in the forests that covered Britain at the time, they were split up from each other and the Celts massacred them in one-on-one fights.
</li><li> Director-writer Franco Dragone, who handled most of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CirqueDuSoleil">Cirque du Soleil</a>'s shows through 1998, arranged for extensive creative workshops with the gymnasts, acrobats, dancers, etc. hired for each show from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NouvelleExperience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/NouvelleExperience">Nouvelle Experience</a></em> onward. He was confident in their technical skills, so in the workshops he focused on getting them in touch with their creative sides. From these, the quirky characters of the shows emerged — performers who were nonetheless highly skilled. The first post-Dragone show, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Dralion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Dralion">Dralion</a></em>, would have used similar methods but they ran up against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> due to a predominantly Chinese cast that was not comfortable with Dragone's style; the creative team instead focused on getting the best work possible out of these technicians, which is why the show isn't as character/theme-focused.
</li><li> Karaoke singers tend to fall into one of these two extremes, and audiences tend to respond equally well to both the guy singing off-key and flubbing the lines while jumping wildly around the stage and the guy nailing the song flawlessly.
</li><li> Many people who audition for <em>X Factor</em> or <em>Idol</em> are either overconfident people with no singing ability, or people with good singing ability who are too nervous to sing well in front of people. People who pass their auditions are usually humble people with good singing ability who can take criticism. They are usually attractive as well, but this isn't always the case.
</li><li> At some culinary schools, this is described as Baker Versus Cook — the former are generally considered to be much more precise in their directions and timing, while the latter improvise a considerable amount more. Bakers <em>have</em> to be precise, as the ratios of the ingredients to one another is absolutely critical to baking. Cooks do not need to be precise and have more freedom to improvise. The differing skillsets are why many larger upscale kitchens will have a dessert chef completely distinct from the executive chef handling appetizers and entrees.
</li><li> Many technicians work hard to get a performalist appearance. Dancers are a good example, but holds for musicians as well.
</li><li> The rivalry between figure skaters Robin Cousins and Jan Hoffman boiled down to could Hoffman win by more on the technical figure tracing than Cousins could on the free program.
</li><li> In Spain, at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalierYears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalierYears">The Cavalier Years</a>, Miguel de Cervantes was a technician, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkHardlyWorks">mediocre playwright and poet </a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WideEyedIdealist">that wanted to establish rules in playwriting so every author in Spain could publish without fear of being arrested and set a standard for quality in entertainment</a>. Felix Lope de Vega, the performer, was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">accomplished natural poet and incredible successful playwright</a> who was convinced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreMorons">Viewers Are Morons</a> and that they must create art with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowestCommonDenominator">Lowest Common Denominator</a> because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyDearBoy">that is what the public wants</a>. (He stated it in verse, its awesome). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSomeoneBetter">Cervantes had serious disagreements with Lope de Vega that at the time seemed pure envy</a>. Cervantes died in poverty and oblivion, while Lope de Vega was always popular and loved.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>. When making the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> films, it was clear to all involved that Lucas was more invested in getting the technical details right first, and crafting an emotionally resonant story second, his constant revisions of the original trilogy has borne this out. Spielberg, while a gifted technician in his own right, is chiefly interested in pulling out all the stops to wrench the emotions of his audience. Their collaborations on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/IndianaJones">Indiana Jones</a></em> shows both their approaches at work.
<ul><li> Also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeLucas">George Lucas</a> and mentor/friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrancisFordCoppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, a more emotional director who (as opposed to Lucas) loved working with actors. After the box office failure of Lucas' first feature, the cold science ficton <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a> film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138">THX 1138</a></em>, Coppola challenged Lucas to do a warmer, more human movie, so Lucas made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanGraffiti">American Graffiti</a></em> a semi-autobiographical <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComingOfAge">Coming of Age</a> comedy to prove he could, and it became a hit.
</li><li> Lucas' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> universe is closer to the performer end of the spectrum compared to the technician <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> universe. The former has a for-its-time and in-some-areas gritty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedFuture">Used Future</a> look and both the dark side and the light side of the Force favor instinct over reason, compared to the rational and utopian <em>Star Trek</em>.
</li><li> Going off of the above example, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StevenSpielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> has a performer ethos compared to the technician mindset of his friend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StanleyKubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>. Compare Kubrick's cerebral, visually dramatic, detached <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> to Spielberg's equally visually dramatic but warmer and more emotionally resonant <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>. Both deal with similar themes regarding the potential consequences of modern science and technological innovation, but are handled totally differently.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MartinScorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> is unique for being both a technician and a performer. He's known like Lucas for extensively preparing, storyboarding his films, and treating the production of a film as mainly an exercise in gathering material for editing (which Scorsese insists is the most important part of any film-making endeavor). On the other hand he's also known for being very visually lush, very intense use of music, and being very actor friendly.
</li></ul></li><li> Automated Production (Technician) vs. Hand Craft (Performer). A robotic production line can make incredibly precise items rapidly and generally wins, however hand crafting has a "personal" and "unique" feel about it that lets someone think less about paying higher amounts for a (generally) lower quality item if it's man made. Even then, certain product benefit better from one method more than the other.
</li><li> Technician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlPacino" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlPacino">Al Pacino</a> compared to performer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarlonBrando">Marlon Brando</a>. Al Pacino said that he would work his ass off in acting... only to come short of what Brando could do in his sleep. Brando was also famous for refusing to memorize lines and often had cue cards on set or just improvised.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AcademyAward">Academy Awards</a> for 2013 see two front runners emerge: the moving story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveYearsASlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveYearsASlave">12 Years a Slave</a></em>, featuring excellent performances, heavily favoured by the actors and writers, and the technical masterpiece <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Gravity">Gravity</a></em>, boasting the best visual effects and use of 3D seen to date. Important to note that <em>12 Years</em> features a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsAndLoadsOfCharacters">large star-studded cast</a>, whereas <em>Gravity</em> merely has <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinimalistCast">3 actors and 3 voices, with the majority of the work being done by the crew</a>. <em>Gravity</em> won 7 awards (Best Director, Best Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound Editing, Visual Effects, Best Original Score and Sound Mixing), but <em>12 Years</em> took home Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay and the grand prize, Best Picture.
<ul><li> 2010 had a similar race between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKingsSpeech">The King's Speech</a></em>. The former won the awards for Sound Editing, Sound Mixing, Visual Effects and Cinematography. The latter won Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture.
</li></ul></li><li> Chris Bliss tends to be belittled in the juggling world for only ever using three balls instead of a more technically demanding higher amount. As a result, the same people find his immense popularity puzzling. However, Bliss' performances are flexible and lively with how he keeps shifting his juggling patterns, while people juggling with more objects tend to repeat the same precise mechanical pattern.
</li><li> In the Asian competitive yo-yoing circuit, the team from Thailand is consistently the technicians while the team from Japan is most often the performers. The prevailing Thai strategy is to incorporate and mimic as flawlessly as possible past winning performances, whereas Japanese yo-yoers, inspired by the improvisational performers that made them an international force, are more inclined to make routines on the fly and create new tricks. The Thai usually get near perfect marks in technical skill whereas the Japanese usually do the same in creativity. (That being said, creativity is given more weight than technical skill, so between the two countries, only Japan has ever represented in world tournaments.)
</li><li> More downplayed than the other examples, but Western martial arts (boxing, German fencing, wrestling) leans towards Technician, while Eastern martial arts (karate, kung-fu, taekwondo), leans towards to Performer.
<ul><li> When put together in a ruleset that allows for both such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MixedMartialArts">Mixed Martial Arts</a> a Technician with a strong grasp of the basic skills of fighting (Boxing, wrestling and submission grappling) tend to dominate a more flashy Performer.
</li></ul></li><li> When it comes to the muscle sport world, there are two types of professionals: the bodybuilder and the strongman. Bodybuilders (technician) focus on mirror-like symmetry and go for the perfect sculptured look with science-based techniques, but their muscles are used for show. When they are in the middle of a competition, they are actually physically at their weakest due to starving and dehydrating themselves to reduce body fat. Strongmen (performer), on the other hand maintain a focus based on the need to be able to do many different tasks and be strong everywhere. While bodybuilders are cut and trim, strongmen are always huge around the middle. This is because the massive weights being lifted and the strange ways they are lifted put immense pressure on the spine and internal organs and a very strong core (with padding from fat deposits) is needed to protect them.
</li><li> In motorsport, while both Technicians and Performers are <em>everywhere</em>, the general rule is that drifting is for Performers wanting to put on a smoky, high-octane show of car control, while grip driving is the realm of Technicians seeking the fastest, most efficient way around the track. That said, there are Technician drifters out to demonstrate superlative mastery of their vehicle, and Performer circuit drivers that engage in stunning battles for position.
<div class="indent"> <em>I drift not because it is a quicker way around a corner, but it is the most exciting way</em> - <strong>Keiichi Tsuchiya</strong>
</div></li><li> Elsewhere in the car enthusiast community, there is the distinction between the Technicians, people who love to tune their cars with performance modifications to extract the maximum power of it; and the Performers, who often just prefer racing and driving pleasure.
</li><li> Education. Ignoring the obvious of Mathematics and Physics versus Art and Music (and possibly English and History too), there's also the more general Everyone Gets A Trophy phenomenon and the promotion of vocational qualifications alongside more academic ones; the public backlash comes from the perception that schools <em>should</em> be about technical (academic) achievement, but they're increasingly seen as pandering to performalists.
<ul><li> By contrast, with career choice after getting an education, this is nearly inverted. Those who pursue more practical jobs tend to be closer to technicians are they tend to find jobs that are in high demand and thus find job stability and a much higher salary. Academia, on the other hand, is less stable and generally only pursued out of passion and curiosity.

Crawford (performer).
</li><li> Robert Falcon Scott (performer) and Roald Amundsen (technician) in the race for South Pole. Scott was very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAdventurer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentlemanAdventurer">Gentleman Adventurer</a>, hoping to conduct a scientific expedition alongside the Pole march and willing to experiment with motor sledges and making unplanned changes to his crew. Amundsen was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> utilitarian who focused solely on reaching the Pole using proven methods (sledge dogs and skiing). Ultimately, Amundsen won, but for a long time Scott and his tragic death on a return march were more remembered.

Those on the softer side tend to be Performers who just want to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">tropes</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceFiction">Science Fiction</a> in interest of telling a well-crafted story. A fine example of the former is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov">Isaac Asimov</a>; of the latter, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RayBradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>.
</li><li> Michael Cimino's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HeavensGate">Heaven's Gate</a></em> is a stern warning for any filmmaker who takes the Technician route too far. He was so obsessed over getting the period details right and perfecting the (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SceneryPorn">admittedly spectacular</a>) cinematography, he neglected to notice that the actual story wasn't strong enough to justify the nearly <em>six-hour</em> running time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts">Classic Disney Shorts</a> vs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> had more principled, sweeping, and painstakingly crafted animation, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a> cartoons were more improvisational, snappy, and willing to step out of the pack. Interestingly, their audiences tend to be drawn for opposite reasons; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleTouchVsFirmHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleTouchVsFirmHand">fans of Disney like their strong emotional feel, whereas fans of Looney Tunes like their down-to-earth wit.</a>
<ul><li> Within Warner Bros., there was a rivalry between technician <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a>, whose cartoons are based on precise timing and attention to detail, and performer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobClampett" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BobClampett">Bob Clampett</a>, whose shorts are filled to the brim with exuberant action and inventive visuals.
</li></ul></li><li> You might think that software developers would be all technicians, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayfulHacker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayfulHacker">Playful Hackers</a> lean toward the "performer" end of the spectrum. One of the tenets of the "hacker ethic" is that code can be beautiful. These people tend to gravitate toward Linux and open source software. While they can create some amazing programs, they unfortunately tend to avoid things like documentation or "proper" coding style, which makes life difficult for the programmers who have to maintain their code after them.
</li><li> With <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames">Video Games</a> this is often the difference between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LetsPlay">Let's Play</a> or Streaming (performers) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalGaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ProfessionalGaming">Professional Gaming</a> (technicians). While there are plenty of people who can do both personality is much more important for Let's Players/Steamers as the basis of their brand whereas for pro gamers skill is paramount.
<ul><li> Hardcore gamers who play to win (technicians) versus softcore and casual gamers who play just to have fun (performers). An age-old rivalry.
</li><li> Within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamagerHealerTank">Damager, Healer, Tank</a> triangle, Damager and Tank are the performers, who are up front with the relatively simple tasks of doing damage and soaking it up, respectively, while the Healer/Support is the technician, micromanaging the team's health and buffs. Heck, think of it as like a theater performance: Damager and Tank are the actors on stage, while the Healer/Support hangs in the back and manages things that actors don't need to care (as much) about. At a higher level though, the paradigm shifts; Damagers become Technicians optimizing their output, while Tanks and Healers become Performers reacting to the ever-changing (and potentially random) conditions of a given encounter.
</li><li> On the production side, large studios and AAA games (technicians) vs small studios and Indie games (performers). Being on the wrong side (so to speak) may have contributed to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HideoKojima">Hideo Kojima</a> leaving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Keep this in mind next time you read or write a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopTenList" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopTenList">Top Ten List</a>: is it the Top 10 Best ____, or is it your Top 10 Favorite ____?
</li><li> With regards to filmmaking, the likes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OscarBait">Oscar Bait</a> tend to be on the technician side — out to please critics and win awards. Blockbusters meanwhile lean towards performer side — emphasis on spectacle and pleasing audiences. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalDissonance">Critical Dissonance</a> exists for this reason — blockbusters will usually have higher scores with audiences than critics, and vice versa.
</li><li> It's often argued that there are only two type of memoirs written by actors: One that focuses heavily on method and the interplay between costars (Technician: <em>A Life in Parts</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BryanCranston">Bryan Cranston</a>), and the other is what it's liked to be secured in a safety harness and dragged behind a car for 200 feet (Performer: <em>If Chins Could Kill</em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceCampbell">Bruce Campbell</a>).
</li><li> In political campaigns, it often comes down to a charismatic candidate with a voice and a vision, against a more reserved individual who focuses on in the nitty-gritty of policies. Often as not, the candidate who cultivates a stronger gut reaction from voters will win the election. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JohnFKennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> vs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardNixon">Richard Nixon</a> is a fairly famous example.
<ul><li> The 2016 elections took this to its extreme with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HillaryClinton">Hillary Clinton</a> (Technician) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> (Performer).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Television" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Television">Television</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a> had two major players in comedy: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieGleason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieGleason">Jackie Gleason</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheHoneymooners">The Honeymooners</a></em>) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucilleBall">Lucille Ball</a> (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ILoveLucy">I Love Lucy</a></em>). While both were actors and thus performers to an extent, the differences were in their approach to their writing: Gleason was firmly in the "Technician" side, with every little bit of his writing planned out in advance, adjusted and revised down to the letter. Ball, on the other hand, had a more "Performer" writing style, providing information and lines to her co-stars and her improvising as she went.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">The Fixed mindset vs. the Growth mindset:<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> People with the Fixed mindset define themselves by their abilities, tend to put more effort in perfecting a single project, but are brought down more by failure. By contrast, those with the Growth mindset define themselves by effort, like to get experience in several subjects under their belts, and are more willing to break a few eggs to make their own omlette.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour">Parkour</a> (which emphasizes efficiency) versus freerunning (which emphasizes aesthetics).
</li><li> In 2000, while observing Brian Orser's performance at the Hershey Figure Skating Challenge, a color commentator recalled the outcome of the "Battle of the Brians" back in 1988, saying that tiebreakers were decided based on the skaters' technical scores, and that if it had been decided based on artistic scores instead, Orser would have won instead of Brian Boitano.
</li><li> In terms of illustrative painting, <a class="urllink" href="https://goddamnshinyrock.tumblr.com/post/161883217020/someone-in-the-notes-of-the-last-leyendecker-post">look no further than J.C Leyendecker verses Norman Rockwell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Both highly respected painters who created cover illustrations for the Saturday evening post, Leyendecker was a Technician who'd do practice painting after practice painting to prep for the finished piece while the Performer Rockwell would copy photo compositions to achieve his pieces. In the end Leyendecker would come out with <a class="urllink" href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/778b553e2da01e36e85ea94480443a30/tumblr_inline_ormolhd5MY1qg36bn_500.jpg">idealized paintings that established superior technical style but often felt less personable<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Rockwell's by comparison used his artistic knowledge to craft <a class="urllink" href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/1b62c16dfcf55f509b0e70a27e5fef72/tumblr_inline_ormon3iIK51qg36bn_500.jpg">intimate and human paintings at the expense of technical skill<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. In the end, the masses regard Rockwell more than Leyendecker for creating quintessential American Icons, while most studying the arts say the inverse with many an artist praising Leyendecker for his technical genius.
</li><li> Career soloist musicians tend to fall into one of these two camps, although there are notable exceptions. In the mid 20th century, the rivalry between Fritz Kreisler (known for his nearly impossible to replicate cadenzas) and Jascha Heifetz (known for inventive performances) was this. They were both eccentric individuals (to put it politely) with titanic egos, and legions of perhaps overly loyal fans. This was also a time when young academics were being encouraged to question the standards and assumptions of older academics. This ended up with someone accusing Kreisler's fans of anti-semitism, in a rather baffling article. As this was the 1960s, the argument was taken more seriously than it probably should have been. Both musicians pushed modern composers in directions they might not otherwise have taken: and reached people well outside the normally insular world of Classical music. What this ultimately led to was more entertaining concerts, regardless of who was performing.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a> was known for the creative tensions between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCleese">John Cleese</a> (technician) who would rigorously analyse scripts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryJones">Terry Jones</a> (Performer) who tended just to go with what felt emotionally right. When it came to making the films - the technician role was taken over by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryGilliam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TerryGilliam">Terry Gilliam</a> who tended to clash with Jones over the direction of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonAndTheHolyGrail">Monty Python and the Holy Grail</a></em> because of this - they eventually compromised with Gilliam overseeing the technical elements of camera placements and lighting and Jones concentrating on working with and directing the actors. Gilliam's concentration on the technical elements meant that his films are often notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledProduction">Troubled Productions</a>, as he doesn't seem to be as good as keeping the rest of the production on track.
</li><li> The two most important creators of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRomero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnRomero">John Romero</a> (performer) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarmack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JohnCarmack">John Carmack</a> (technician). Carmack is genius programmer responsible for all the technical achievements <em>Doom</em> pulled off, while Romero was the one who came up with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RatedMForManly">Rated M for Manly</a>-cum-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathMetal">Death Metal</a>-cum-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">Gorn</a> aesthetic the series is infamous for. Romero became the face of the company while Carmack stayed in the background. Eventually the two split over creative differences of how they wanted to design games, for example Romero wanted bigger and flashier games while Carmack firmly believed in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExcusePlot">Excuse Plot</a>. In the end Carmack won, Romero is the more famous of the two, but nowadays he is well known for the disaster that was his pet project <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Daikatana">Daikatana</a></em>, while Carmack's career has quietly continued to blossom in the tech field.
</li><li> Puppeteers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a> have to have elements of both styles strictly by necessity, as in most cases the same person is providing the voice, delivering the dialogue, and manipulating the puppet all at once. As the Muppet Performers come from a diverse series of backgrounds, some lean more in one direction than another.
<ul><li> Jerry Nelson, for example, had a rather stiff, unexpressive style of puppetry, and even his lip-sync wasn't as precise as most of the others. On the other hand, he was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCastShowOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCastShowOff">The Cast Show Off</a> for his singing, his ability to deliver both hilarious and heart-wrenching performances, and he was the group's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManOfAThousandVoices">Man of a Thousand Voices</a>.
</li><li> Dave Goelz, by contrast, did not come from a creative or performing background (he was an engineer), and got his start designing and building puppets. As a result, when he became a puppeteer himself he knew all the technical skills to operating the puppets, but it took a few years before he was confident enough in himself as a performer to realize the emotional, loveable characters he is now known for.
</li><li> This is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrankOz">Frank Oz</a> was universally considered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> during his tenure with the Muppets - he could steal the show with a spectacular performance, or contribute to a scene almost invisibly with masterful, silent subtlety.
</li></ul></li><li> Film acting versus stage acting in a lot of regards. Stage acting requires a lot more technical skill - from projection, diction, the ability to be big without being over the top and having to do an entire performance in one show (often multiple days and nights in a row). Film acting is a lot more instinctual, with a lot of subtleties and more room for improvisation (improv is done in theatre too but in a controlled way), while also requiring the focus to continually deliver after multiple takes. The result is that some screen actors lack the presence to be good on the stage and that some theatre actors are too big for film work (Laurie Metcalfe for example prefers the stage for this reason). And there are of course plenty of actors who can do both.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7IooT-CLnk">This video of artistic gymnasts trying parkour<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> shows the perspective of similar movements and skills, but used in very different manners: gymnastics has a focus on technical perfection and very standardized ways to do things, while parkour is much more free and focused on efficient movement. The gymnasts have no problem mastering the movements, but they admit that it's an interesting experience to step out the rigid standards of gymnastics, while the parkour instructors admit that they were impressed by how cleanly the gymnast did things. In a positive spin of this trope, both sides end up learning from the others and gaining mutual respect.
</li><li> The long-awaited cooking showdown between Gordon Ramsay and Bobby Flay, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaporware">if and when it happens</a>, will be this, with Ramsay as the culinary expert and Flay as the competition expert.
</li><li> Among writers in general "plotters" and "pantsers" could be considered technicians and performers, respectively. "Plotters" prefer to write out an outline and compose character profiles before starting on the story, while those who write "by the seat of their pants" tend to just sit down and make it up as they go. Pantsers might be prone to wandering off on tangents or developing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTumor">Plot Tumors</a> as they work, necessitating a good editor or a rudimentary outline to keep things on track.
