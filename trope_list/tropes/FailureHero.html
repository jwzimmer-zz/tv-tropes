</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>:
<ul><li> Yamcha suffers this way due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect">The Worf Effect</a>. Early on, he was used in each Tenkaichi Budoukai to show off how amazing some new character was. This continued with successive new enemies killing or almost killing him first to prove their threat level. After Android #20 impaled him through the chest, Yamcha decided just to call it quits for the day and start rocking a yellow <em>Miami Vice</em> suit. He still ended up being murdered (again) by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> an arc later.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, every non-Saiyan fighter (or more specifically, every fighter not named Goku or Gohan) suffers this by the start of the Frieza Saga. Even Piccolo who gets two hefty powerups, is still only good for holding off a major foe for an episode or two before being disposed of. Vegeta suffers a similar fate, despite being a Saiyan and second in strength to Goku. Vegeta practically exists to show that being a Saiyan with cosmic levels of power still isn't enough to make a dent in the enemy for long, you have to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartIsAnAwesomePower">heart</a> like Goku has.
</li><li> Gotenks is hyped up to be the warrior destined to save the universe from Majin Buu, but he utterly fails at doing so, getting his ass handed to him by Fat Buu and losing to Super Buu because he was too busy showboating and trying to make himself look cool. This continues into <em>Super</em>, where he doesn't contribute anything useful whenever he appears; he gets literally spanked by Beerus, defuses before he can even throw an attack at Frieza because of his time-consuming posturing, and is curb-stomped by Copy-Vegeta's base form. It's to the extent that in the Tournament of Power, Goku and Vegeta decide right off the bat that after Gotenks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">screwed up so badly</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnceDoneNeverForgotten">while fighting Super Buu</a>, there's no way in Hell they're trusting him to try to save the world again.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Future Trunks gets this hard. For over a year, he fights <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Goku Black</span> and loses every time despite his best efforts. Black also gets stronger every time they battle, making victory for him more impossible. After going to the past to get help, Goku, Vegeta, and he still can't beat Black and Black has a powerful ally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Future Zamasu, who is an immortal</span>. During their second battle, he learns that Black specifically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> chose his timeline to punish him for breaking the time taboo and creating a new Time Ring when he saved Goku from the heart virus</span>. All this frustration and anger causes him to transform into a new form of Super Saiyanwhich only puts him on par with Black and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Future Zamasu</span>, and he's quickly overwhelmed. Then, just when it seems he finally won against all the odds thanks to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> unconsciously creating a Spirit Bomb from all the survivors on Earth, merging it into his sword, and slicing Merged Zamasu in half</span>, it all comes crashing down when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Merged Zamasu's soul fuses with the multiverse and kills everyone in it except for a named few. What's left is erased by Future Zen'o, leaving Trunks' timeline nothing but an empty void. Except for Future Mai, Trunks <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllForNothing">literally lost everything</a></span>.
</li><li> Goku has been inflicted with this since <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZBattleOfGods">Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</a></em>, despite all the new amazing power-ups he has achieved throughout the new era of <em>Dragon Ball</em>.

However, this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> as Goku has a great desire to defeat his enemies in a fair one-on-one fight, and him killing a Freeza was a cheap shot that he didn't earn by himself. This trend continues in the <em>Super</em> anime, where he manages to lose <em>twice</em> in the Tournament of the Gods of Destruction, gets another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> against Copy-Vegeta (Monaka is the one who saved the day, not Goku), he never wins against Black or Zamasu, and in the Tournament of Power, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Goku ultimately doesn't win the tournament and has to take down Jiren in a mutual triple ring-out with Freeza's help</span>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuperBroly">Dragon Ball Super: Broly</a></em>, Goku gets his ass whooped by Broly for a good portion of their fight and ultimately resorts to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionDance">Fusion</a> to defeat him.
</li></ul></li><li> Osamu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/WorldTrigger">World Trigger</a></em> is what happens when you take a regular, normal character and put him in a superpower infested hellhole. Quite practically everyone is stronger than Osamu, even the girl he swore to protect, and he has to consistently be helped and saved during fights. This very barely get better through the series, as Osamu's power progression is painfully slow, taking several dozen episodes to be able to beat even the weakest of his enemies. The saving grace he has is that he's willing to work hard...But that can only take you so far.
</li><li> While Clare from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Claymore">Claymore</a></em> is introduced as a badass demon hunter with a cold attitude, it appears most of the reason for her existence the entire rest of the series is to show how much more awesome her comrades are than her. This is in huge contrast to Vegeta who despite suffering from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorfEffect">Worf Effect</a> all the time still manages to show a much stronger performance than Goku overall.
<ul><li> Albeit understandable, as she's ranked dead last by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NebulousEvilOrganisation">the Organization.</a>
</li><li> As a matter of fact, most of the heroes in the series spend the majority of their battles being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb Stomped</a> and horribly mutilated by every other baddie they face. It's not even an uncommon occurrence for the warriors to outright lose their fights, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnyoneCanDie">even die</a> without ever having their conflict resolved. Though one could argue that this makes the series a tad more realistic — if you were to go up against an army of all-powerful demons with only half their blood keeping you anywhere close to even footing, you'd damn well better expect them to mop the floor with your half-breed ass.
</li><li> Though, many of Clare's early failures are justified by the revelation later on that she focused all of her training on fighting Awakened Beings — while all the Claymores tend to get curb-stomped by them, she's usually able to fight far above her weight class when they're involved.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>, one gets the sense that Rei Hiroe is a sadist from the fact that Rock is <em>never</em> going to learn that trying to do good in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> he <em>voluntarily</em> entered will <strong>always</strong> end in tears.

Probably because, much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuYuHakusho">Yuusuke Urameshi</a>, even she has problems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantCatchUp">catching up</a>.
</li><li> Fate seems to be against the main heroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>.
<ul><li> Ichigo Kurosaki could not seem to get a break after the Soul Society arc. He suffered a crushing defeat by Yammy (someone he should've easily been able to beat) on behalf of his inner hollow's interference and was later beaten to a bloody pulp by Grimmjow during his invasion. Later a weaker Grimmjow (he had lost an arm) had beaten him again (once more due to his hollow, but this time it was because he couldn't use his hollow mask) and would've killed him had Rukia and Shinji not interfered. Later when Orihime was abducted by Ulquiorra, he suffered another crushing defeat by Ulquiorra which would've certainly meant his demise. Only after Grimmjow had Orihime heal him was when he was able to beat Grimmjow. However, the moment was brief as Nnoitra was able to wipe the floor with him and Nel before having his right-hand Tesla pulverize him. Once again, it took someone else's interference for him to proceed (in this case it was Kenpachi). Even after all that, Orihime was kidnapped by Stark and brought to Ulquiorra, who once again was able to beat him easily and only through the intervention of his inner hollow was he able to kill Ulquiorra. After that he fell victim to another power lapse and Yammy (who has become more powerful) was able to gain the upper hand and nearly kill him before Kenpachi and Byakuya intervened. It wasn't until his fight against Aizen that he finally secured a victory (granted he needed the aid of Urahara and Yoruichi, but still) and even then he ends up losing his powers.
</li><li> Yasutora "Chad" Sado got hit with this just as badly, if not worse. He was already defeated by Shunsui rather easily and was unable to even make Nnoitra flinch. The latter was able to easily defeat him. Not to mention Yammy was able to make quick work of him in his pre-release state.
</li><li> Rukia Kuchiki as well, though she wasn't hit nearly as hard as the former two. She was barely able to beat Aaroniero and was beaten by Yammy as if she were cannon fodder. One could argue she suffered this as early as the first arc as she was captured, unable to use her shinigami powers (she gave most of hers to Ichigo and as a result was weaker).

</li><li> Saya Kisaragi of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodC">Blood-C</a></em> takes Failure Hero to a whole new level. She has an innate talent for killing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonsterOfTheWeek">Monster of the Week</a>... after said monster has managed to viciously slaughter everyone she was intended to protect. She does manage to save a girl from the Eyeball Elder Bairn in the park, but scares her to death when she tries to help her while covered in blood. Considering the ultimate fate of the town, however, this probably didn't amount to much. She does become perfectly competent in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodCTheLastDark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BloodCTheLastDark">the movie</a>. Her incompetence from the TV series is brought by Fumito having drugged her to hinder her abilities.

Fortunately for him, things start improving for him in the first Choujin Olympics arc.
</li><li> The main cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> rarely ever manage to successfully bring in a bounty, and never as the focus of an episode. Most of the bounty heads they go after end up dead before they can be brought in, and when they don't, something else inevitably happens to make it impossible for the bounty to be collected, such as the bounty head turning out to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an artificial intelligence</span> or <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the bounty having been placed under false pretenses</span>. On the rare occasion that they <em>do</em> collect a bounty, the property damage and medical expenses incurred in the process guarantee that they won't come out ahead... assuming that the payout isn't so paltry as to barely count as pocket change.
</li><li> Luffy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> got hit with Failure Hero status hard in the Sabaody, Impel Down, and Marineford story arcs. First, he failed to protect his crew at Sabaody from an admiral and his subordinates and they all nearly died only to be saved by Kuma who traumatized Luffy by separating his crew one at a time before his eyes before sending him off. Just when he was ready to reunite with his crew he finds out that his older brother is about to be executed in less than a week, forcing him to break into the most dangerous prison in the world to save him. He is then defeated in said prison by the warden and left to die by poison. Luffy is saved, but it costs him ten years of his life and because it took him so long to recover he failed to reach his brother in time before he is transported to his execution ground. After fighting his way out, Luffy escapes the prison, but he had to leave behind one of his friends to do it. When Luffy finally reached the war zone, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OvershadowedByAwesome">promptly beaten up</a> by every strong person there and is pushed past his physical breaking point. He is forced to risk his life further by taking more adrenaline just to keep going. When Luffy did finally succeed in saving his brother, Ace died in his arms saving him from a killing blow from one of the admirals. To say the least, Luffy had a terrible week. The entire experience convinces him and the others that they're not yet ready for the New World, and they spend two years training.
</li><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PrincessTutu">Princess Tutu</a></em>, Duck sees herself as this due to being locked out of the loop and feeling unable to help anyone or stop what's happening.

Since her debut in Pro Wrestling, she has done nothing but lose, in the same way: she is put in a Boston Crab hold and dragged away from the rope, and, unable to get out of the Boston Crab, she gives up. She had <em>50 losses</em> this way so far. Her fans diminish with each loss, and the audience starts booing her... until she got dragged into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> where she's forced to stop giving up or else her mentor will break her bones via Boston Crab (doesn't take 'give up' for an answer) and afterwards, she would avoid the booing and instead being cheered despite her losses. Rinse and repeat 15 times afterwards until she gets her own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinishingMove">Finishing Move</a> and <em>then</em> she started avoiding the trope.
</li><li> Shuzo Matsutani from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NowAndThenHereAndThere">Now and Then, Here and There</a></em> attempts plenty of heroic stuff, but doesn't accomplish anything at all. In the first episode, he fails to rescue Lala-Ru from the giant robot snakes, then he is captured and tortured. Ultimately, it's Lala-Ru who defeats the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>, not Shu. And the final shot gives the impression that Shu should have just stayed home and not talked to Lala-Ru on the smokestack. Remove him from the series and very little would have changed.
</li><li> The first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> tries to shake up its formula of every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictimOfTheWeek">Victim of the Week</a> using the Hell Correspondence to damn both their tormentor and themselves to hell by introducing Hajime, a tabloid reporter who discovers the Hell Correspondence and starts trying to prevent people from using it. Except that nothing really changes, because he fails every single time. The only person that he manages to stop from using it is his own daughter.

It seems that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">Chypre</a> was a little premature in "Weakest Pretty Cure in History" calling.

This is mainly because he doesn't want to BE heroic at all; what he really wants is to make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>, so he is subject to many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatAnIdiot">What an Idiot!</a> moments over the story.

She is a perennial loser who is constantly getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">captured and tied up</a> by supervillains, even bush leaguers like Glue Gun Gil and regular old non-super thugs. In fact it isn't until about the middle of the vol. 1 that the reader actually sees Emp succeed at anything. Even when she does succeed it often backfires on her or her victory goes unnoticed by her fellow capes. Like when she defeated a supervillain that had taken out most of the Superhomeys by ramming him with a Humvee she ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoundAndGagged">tangled in the seatbelt</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Major Havok</a>, despite being unconscious at the time, took credit for Emp's victory. Then again when the Capey's were besieged by Fleshmaster <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka dWARf!</span> Emp single-handedly defeated him and saved the day!...And then her teammates promptly accused her of being the real mastermind behind the whole thing. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">All that being said, in one volume Emp went up against Deathmonger and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome">totally mopped the floor with him</a>. Major Havoc doesn't believe her and call BS on the whole affair, while Captain Rivet is skeptical, but the Superdead defended her and named her as their liaison with the superhero community, so that has to count for something.</span>

However, no matter what they would almost always lose because the "foes" they faced were real people with much more power than Calvin, like his babysitter, his parents, or his teacher.

Aries, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Face">Face</a> in this feud, teamed up with the less established wrestlers Matt Cross and Erick Stevens.

Wrestling logic dictated that the NRC get the early advantage in the feud, but without Aries around, Cross &amp; Stevens had <em>no</em> credibility to begin with.

Conscripted by the billion, given laughably inadequate equipment, following moronic plans by incompetent (if not outright traitorous) generals and of course, executed whenever they complain, piss themselves at the horrors they're facing or think of a way to win that <em>isn't</em> the way the Imperium has been doing for the past few thousand years.

<ul><li> Ironically enough, many of his failures seem have side effects that turn them into successes, for example, the robotic Aradia clones that came from doomed timelines that were attributed to his failures were essential to win, and Aradia also states the the Mobius Double Reacharound virus was essential to winning as well.

The show is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstructive parody</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">Cyberpunk</a> action films.
</li><li> Racing cartoons tend to have one of these characters:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WackyRaces">Wacky Races</a></em>' Dick Dastardly, despite being as lukewarm a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> as you can possibly get, definitely falls into this trope. Even in the rare instances he conquers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat">his obsession to cheat</a> he still manages to become a Boring Failure Hero. He actually managed to win <em>once</em>, even to the narrator's surprise.
</li><li> His <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> Phantom Fink suffers the same problem; when he does win, the prize is absolutely horrible.
</li><li> No matter <em>who</em> wins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogisSpaceRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YogisSpaceRace">Yogi's Space Race</a></em>, something happens to make the prize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Undesirableprize" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Undesirableprize">undesirable</a>. One wonders why the racers keep coming back.
</li></ul></li><li> The protagonists of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>. Not only do <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">Eddy</a> and his crew fail at their attempts to scam kids, they also completely fail at legitimate ventures or even completely innocent goals like gaining a little respect from their friends. The constant teasing and harassing of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> neighbors only rubs salt into the wound. In the movie <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">this is subverted. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarnYourHappyEnding">The other kids finally accept the Eds into their group after seasons of turmoil</a></span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a></em>'s titular protagonist may as well be the paradigm of this trope. Despite being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hunk">Hunk</a>, he is rebuffed by almost every woman he flirts with and instantly receives a smackdown from them. On top of that, he also fails at even the most mundane tasks and is even beaten up by people about half his size. The fact that he doesn't even get a happy ending in the series finale says a lot about his constant failures.
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBuzzOnMaggie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBuzzOnMaggie">The Buzz on Maggie</a></em>. Mostly everything she tries to accomplish fails, or backfires in her face.
</li><li> The main theme of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>, where all the characters are failures, both heroes and villains. It really says something when even the most badass character on the show, Brock Sampson, is a failure. Brock was a promising college football player who had to quit school because he accidentally killed a man on the field. Then he goes off to OSI, where he gets paired with a guy tagged as a crazy conspiracy theorist by the department. Despite being as awesome as he is, he gets assigned <strike>guard</strike> babysitter duty to Dr. Venture, a washed-up, sociopathic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnidisciplinaryScientist">Omnidisciplinary Scientist</a>, and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a> kids. He's viewed as just about as much a waste of great potential in his field as Dr. Venture in his own. On top of everything, he can get any woman on the planet, except the one woman he actually loves.
<ul><li> Much like Brock, Dr. Orpheus initially seems like anything but this trope, being genuinely a highly skilled sorcerer with a multitude of arcane powers. However, it eventually gets pointed out that he's had to spend his whole life studying to acquire his mystic abilities, neglecting every other aspect of his life, and with them he's ultimately accomplished... absolutely nothing.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckJones">Chuck Jones</a>' interpretation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DaffyDuck">Daffy Duck</a> was meant to represent a polar opposite of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a>, constantly attempting to take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">The Ace</a> role, be it a super hero, a western sheriff or a detective, only to get his ass handed to him by even the most incompetent of villains, with real heroes Bugs or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyPig">Porky</a> usually clearing things up. Other directors occasionally placed Daffy as a bumbling hero as well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">though it varied</a> whether he was an actual failure or not.
</li><li> One of the major problems most fans have with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em> is that no matter what the heroes do, it almost never matters. They usually end up soundly defeated, and on the rare occasions that they <em>do</em> win, it just furthers the villains' goals somehow.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>. His luck/skill during missions is almost always <em>just</em> enough to ensure that he lives to screw up another one. It gets to the point where villains will sometimes hire him to foil their own plots because they're so sure he'll fail.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Freakazoid">Freakazoid!</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow">Show Within a Show</a> called Hero Boy, a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AstroBoy">Astro Boy</a></em>, where the eponymous hero <em>always</em> fails in comic fashion. In the one episode we see, he tried to beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> attacking Tokyo by ineffectually beating its foot before it brushes him off with nary a second thought. It also happens to be Freakazoid's favorite show.
<ul><li> The Huntsman is something of a downplayed example, as he'd probably be very competent... if he ever got to do anything.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks">The Boondocks</a></em>:
<ul><li> Huey was this in "The Passion of Reverend Ruckus" and "It's a Black President, Huey Freeman". The reason? Cause he couldn't get a ride.
</li><li> Riley in "Shinin" because he couldn't get his chain back from Butch Magnus. All of his plans to get the chain back failed and when he had help from Flonominal, Butch overpowered him too. He did get the chain back, but only because it was worthless and Butch couldn't get any money off it.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the most notable examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> was Wendy Testaburger in "The Hobbit". She first tried standing up for Lisa Berger after Butters called her fat and later tried to tell Butters the truth about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KimKardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> using photoshop. Naturally, it makes things worse and the tables are turned on Wendy, who is unable to fight back against the issue. In the end after some convincing from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KanyeWest">Kanye West</a>, she tearfully makes a photoshop photo of herself. Long story short, the photoshop trend got the best of her.
</li><li> Whenever the lead character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a></em> takes his examination for his boating license, Spongebob will almost inevitably either fail the examination, or manage to get his license... until some technicality comes up and Spongebob's license is rescinded and he has to take the course over again, much to the anguish of Mrs. Puff, who is stuck with once again teaching Spongebob.
</li><li> Season Two of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone">The Dreamstone</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization">flanderized</a> Rufus and Amberley into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleIncompetent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleIncompetent">Invincible Incompetent</a> variations, making it apparent most of their victories against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain">the Urpneys</a> in Season One were because the latter were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawLoser">too ineffectual to even put up a fight against two children.</a> Just by <em>slightly</em> upping their game, the two Noops became useless or outright made the situation worse, always relying on their far more powerful comrades or dumb luck saving them after they screwed up. Season Three had them gradually become competent again, though some episodes make it apparent they got an easy target.
</li><li> Poor Shining Armor from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>.

It doesn't help either that his two strengths, creating shields and leading, are <em>soundly</em> outdone by his wife and sister, leaving him no real area to shine with his expertise. Similarly, his wife Princess Cadance spends most of her time as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">Damsel in Distress</a> defeated by whatever threat appears and needing to be saved by Twilight. In fact, across eight seasons the closest the two of them ever get to genuine victory are situations where they combine their talents. In the final battle, Twilight Sparkle effectively tells them to stay home so she and the other heroes can deal with it instead.
