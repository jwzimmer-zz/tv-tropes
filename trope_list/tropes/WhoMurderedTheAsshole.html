</div></div><p>Someone has been murdered. The first step is simply to determine what sort of motivation someone might have had to kill them. There's just one problem: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">they were a complete and total asshole</a>, so <em>everyone</em> wanted to kill them.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>Establishing that the victim was widely despised makes for a more challenging murder mystery because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuspect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsASuspect">sheer number of suspects with motives</a>. This helps to draw out the investigation and makes obtaining a conviction harder, as the jury might sympathize with the killer. Expect the police to express the feeling at some point that maybe this guy deserved to die, and that his killer did a public service. Typically, at the end, it's discovered that the murder was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHerring">unrelated</a> to the victim's being so thoroughly despised, or at least not directly related. Either that or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyDidIt">his targets got fed up enough to work together and create plausible deniability for any one suspect</a>.
</p><p>It might also be used to make the audience <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticMurderer">sympathize with the murderer</a> when they're finally discovered. Because of the morally challenging nature of this plot, it's best to send in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByTheBookCop">By-the-Book Cop</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor">Knight in Sour Armor</a> to solve the crime because they try to not become emotionally compromised. A common message in these kinds of stories is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">two wrongs</a> do not make a right.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/AceAttorneyInvestigations">Ace Attorney Investigations</a></em> manga, Emi St. Cloud is one, being a selfish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BitchInSheepsClothing">puts on a good image for the public</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceCharacterMeanActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceCharacterMeanActor">plays the heroine in Othello Detectives</a>. However, she was not killed by any of the people she wronged, but out of a belief that her death and her fiance, who is one of the male leads, being arrested for her murder would prevent Othello Detectives from being released.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em> manga, this happens with Robin Wolfe. In the recent past, he invited Eddie Johnson, a talented employee who didn't work well with others, to his house for a private chat, and tortured him in the Den of Spiders, resulting in Eddie being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">Driven to Suicide</a>. This angered Eddie's brother, Brock, as well as Robin's daughter, Lira (who was in a relationship with Eddie, and believed her father killed him because he didn't approve). When you consider that Robin's brother Bobby has long resented him for treating him like a nuisance, and Robin has a cold relationship with his wife, Theridia, virtually everyone wants him dead.

<ul><li> The murder victim in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Bully">Bully</a></em>, which is based on a real homicide of a teen who bullied and abused his best friend, his best friend's girlfriend, and all of his associates.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrookedHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrookedHouse">Crooked House</a></em>, Aristide Leonides was not a very nice man. He controlled his family by playing cruel mind games. Every single person related to him had a good reason for wanting him dead.

</li><li> The film <em>Drowning Mona</em> centers around solving the murder of a cruel woman, found in her car at the bottom of a lake, who was hated by everyone in a small town, making almost everyone in the town a suspect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turned out several characters were responsible for the murder, and none of them were working together or knew what the others were up to.</span>

Complicating the investigation further is that one of the detectives believes the murderer to have been an "invalid" (person who has not been genetically engineered, the way everyone else at the institute has) and his motivation to have been the victim's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">finding this out about him</a>. Moreover, the <em>real</em> culprit turns out to be one who was genetically engineered to have an even-tempered personality, despite having very brutally bludgeoned the victim to death.

Though the victim as we see him is portrayed relatively sympathetically, seeming to be a fairly nice old duffer with a horrible harpy of a wife (she tears chunks out of him at dinner in front of all their friends), his past is not so clear and when he is murdered it turns out everyone had a motive.

So when Hudgens is found murdered, the natural thought is that after years of doing that he finally ran a story or found dirt on the wrong person, not that he was part of an elaborate criminal conspiracy and became a loose end.

He's portrayed as a total jackass from the minute he steps on board, so don't feel too guilty when he's splattered across a Pullman carriage for the watcher's entertainment. As more is learned about him after the murder, it becomes even clearer just how deserving he was of his fate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He murdered a baby girl, ruined her family's life in the process, and got away with it scot-free.</span> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot">Poirot</a> eventually lets his murderers go.

Christie plays with this one, as Poirot immediately points out that this is not a safe hobby. Much of the book is spent trying to find out what murders the suspects previously committed. As a further sign of Shaitana's arrogance, very late in the book, it is revealed that one of the so-called "murderers" was actually innocent of his original crime, and thus did not deserve to be put through Shaitana's mind game in the first place.
</li><li> Simeon Lee in <em>Hercule Poirot's Christmas</em> is a selfish old millionaire, who plays sadistic mind games with his family. Here, however, the murder was actually personal revenge.

However, yet again, the murder turns out to have been committed for purely selfish motives.
</li><li> Mrs. Boynton in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AppointmentWithDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AppointmentWithDeath">Appointment with Death</a></em> is one of Christie's more extreme examples: she's an almost hypnotic 'mental sadist' who uses sheer force of personality to absolutely control her family and uses that power to psychologically torture them. Her murder, while selfishly motivated, is related to her domineering nature, as she died by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackmailBackfire">Blackmail Backfire</a>.
</li><li> The short story "The Under Dog" (1926) is another example by Christie. The victim was Sir Reuben Astwell, a wealthy businessman and a man of violent temper. He had poor relations with most of his family members and frequently quarreled with them, he managed to alienate his loving wife by threatening to get rid of her right-hand-woman, he was verbally abusive to all of his employees, and he owed part of his wealth to cheating business associates out of their share of the profits in business ventures. Almost everyone has a motive and nobody seems to mourn him. The murderer turns out to be Owen Trefusis, Reuben's loyal secretary for 9 years. He was noted throughout the story to be a particularly meek, patient, and soft-spoken man. It turns out that Reuben was systematically abusing Owen for years, using him as something of a punching bag for verbal abuse. Whenever anyone else got Reuben mad, he took out his anger on Owen. Because Owen, unlike the others, never talked back. During the last session of verbal abuse, Owen briefly snapped and killed his employer. The murder was not even premeditated, and Owen had nothing to gain from it.

What makes this even more Exaggerated was that the story was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RippedFromTheHeadlines">Ripped from the Headlines</a>. It was pretty much a fictional retelling of the murder of Charles Augustus Howell, an alleged blackmailer who was found dead or dying with his throat slit and a half-sovereign coin stuffed in his mouth. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">He was ruled to have died from TB, with the slit throat happening postmortem.</a>

He was so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">deservedly</a> hated and reviled that the characters who actually cared about finding the true killer said that practically all of Westeros had <em>some</em> motive to kill him and even the most occult of poisons isn't <em> that</em> difficult to get hold of, so... um.

Yeah, sure, suspects were named, but it's clear that few in Court are truly convinced that they are actually the ones who did it, even though it's currently politically expedient to officially agree they must have.
</li><li> Historically, Maegor Targaryen, a similarly cruel, vicious and murderous king, was found dead on the Iron Throne. Nobody knew who killed him (though it's implied that he could have killed himself), and nobody cared to find out. A common superstition is that the Throne itself murdered him.

</li><li> Zane in <em>Welcome To Temptation</em> (by Jennifer Crusie) was essentially trying to blackmail and/or harass almost every prominent person in town and annoyed the hell out of pretty much everyone else. Amusingly enough, despite his having been hit by a car, maced in the face, bundled up in a shower curtain and disposed of...<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he died of a heart condition without actually having been murdered at all.</span>

Lady Violetta "Gnasher" Ickenham unleashes a stream of invective against everyone else at the dinner table and how much she's dedicated herself to making their lives hell, before adding that she's finally going to do something about the typing error in her will that names them all as beneficiaries...
</li><li> Several cases in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InDeath">In Death</a></em> series have a wealth of suspects thanks to the victim being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">a terrible person</a>. One textbook example is Richard Draco in <em>Witness in Death</em>, who proves to have been such scum while he was alive that Eve for the first time in the series admits that she can't feel any sympathy for him nor condemn his murderer. Since the murder takes place during a stage production of <em>Witness For the Prosecution</em>, nods to Agatha Christie abound.
</li><li> In the Josh Lanyon gay murder mystery <em>Somebody Killed His Editor</em>, both of the victims were reprehensible jerks who habitually trod on and mistreated others. This has the effect of setting up the protagonist, writer Christopher Holmes, as a main suspect, since he'd been publicly humiliated by both and he had verbally shot back at each of them, just as publicly, in retaliation, in one case joking about how he'd poison the future victim if he had the chance.
</li><li> In <em>Aunt Dimity: Detective</em> by Nancy Atherton, no one in Finch particularly mourns when Prunella "Pruneface" Hooper, possibly the most obnoxious person in town, is found dead under mysterious circumstances (Aunt Dimity, the narrator's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> ghostly</span> adviser and confidant, as good as states outright that Prunella has gone to Hell). Pretty much everyone but the narrator and her immediate family has a motive, and there's a very long chain of witnesses providing evidence pointing directly to someone else, who has evidence pointing directly to someone else, who has evidence pointing directly to someone else... <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The final witness actually reveals the truth: Pruneface died of an accidental head injury, and the witness assumed she'd only been knocked out and went about their day.</span>

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneOfUsIsLying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OneOfUsIsLying">One Of Us Is Lying</a></em> revolves around the murder of a high school student who ran a highly damaging gossip app and delighted in using it to tear others down. He was murdered while in detention with four other students, each of whom he was about to publish some major dirt on. As the murderer clearly had to be in the room at the time, the police investigation focuses pretty much exclusively on the "Bayview Four" but, as others point out, there were plenty of people who might have wanted him dead.

</li><li> Perhaps the biggest example of the show is The Gravedigger <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a.k.a.

</li><li> An egomaniac Paris Hilton-esque reality show star.
</li><li> A convicted pedophile on parole. He was staying at his brother's house, and the stress of having him around plus the associated harassment by the neighbors caused said brother's pregnant wife to miscarry. The brother then catches the pedophile spying on a playground which turns out to be the last straw and kills him.
</li><li> A millionaire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">serial litigator</a>. Murdered by a chef whose life she had completely destroyed as she was getting ready to do <em>the same</em> on his new workplace.
</li><li> A horribly corrupt Deputy Mayor of NYC responsible for embezzling several million dollars out of various charities and refusing to raise policemen's salaries leading to a city-wide strike. Murdered by his 10-year-old OCD son after he planned on sending him to a boarding school out of frustration for his condition.

The man who killed her? <em>An FBI informant</em> who was fed up with the Bureau having its hands tied even after he had given them truckloads of evidence.
</li><li> Three men, guilty of various crimes, who brutally beat the girl who had got them arrested — and wasn't even supposed to have to testify. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> They were killed by their attorneys, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney">who didn't much care if their sleazy clients killed, intimidated, or beat up their (usually) equally sleazy accusers</a>, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">couldn't stand what the men had done to that girl</a>.</span> When one of the killers points out to Mac that they're likely to get away with it and asks, "Can you really say we shouldn't?", Mac doesn't look too happy — but doesn't say "no" either.

</li><li> On one episode a contestant on a cooking show is found killed and cooked, and then later another one is found poisoned. Turns out the female producer of the show offed them both because she discovered that they were the ones who raped and murdered her sister years before, and had lied about the truth to her face while pretending to comfort her.

But he actually died when he sat in a chair that he hadn't fixed, causing it to break, dumping him into the brothel's swimming pool, where he drowned. The team let everyone off the hook on the grounds that it was apparently judged a (<em>self-inflicted</em>) accidental death, and Nick even snarking that if the case made it to trial, the defense attorneys would just say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseLaw">the chair was the real killer</a>.

<ul><li> One episode has the title character investigate the deaths of a bunch of violent mobsters. It turns out that they died because they pulled guns on another criminal, making it difficult to determine to what extent their deaths count as acts of self-defense. The killer tries to excuse himself by pointing out that his victims were assholes.
</li><li> Also, in the episode "Mr. Monk and the Red Headed Stranger", Sonny Cross, the murder victim, was a person who embezzled a lot of money (embezzling $400,000 from Willie Nelson, and it is implied that this is not the first time he has done so later on in the episode), and he also did time for drunk driving and vehicular manslaughter. In regards to the latter incident, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">also received a very lenient punishment</a>, spending only 18 months in prison. Also, the murderer was a blind woman (well, half-blind, she regained the sight of one of her eyes from slipping on the floor at a Supermarket) who was the sole survivor of her family, the family who was killed by Cross's drunk driving, and it was because of his manslaughter that she was even blind in the first place.

However, there are actually some exceptions scattered throughout the show's long run of some perfectly nice people getting killed, but one in particular stands out as a very deliberate subversion of this trope. It centers around this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmugSnake">Smug Snake</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptCorporateExecutive">Corrupt Corporate Executive</a> where everything about him just seems to <em>scream</em> Asshole Victim... until you get to the halfway point and the murder victim is the exec's much nicer brother.
</li><li> Rather frequent on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurdochMysteries">Murdoch Mysteries</a></em>.
<ul><li> The victim in Season 1's "Child's Play" was murdered by his wife after discovering he was molesting the daughter they adopted - and had done so with their own biological daughter, who he murdered when she grew old enough to fight back. While questioning the adopted girl's brother, who was the prime suspect at the time, Inspector Brackenreid (an orphan himself) reassured him by saying that he would have done it too. Over the course of the investigation, it was also revealed that the victim employed orphans (including their adopted daughter's brother) to steal horses to supply his glue factory.
</li><li> The victim in "Me, Myself, and Murdoch". The prime suspect for his murder is his stepdaughter, who has multiple personalities that resulted from her seeing her stepfather hack up her mother with an axe when she was a child. The man got another woman to marry him and pose as his original wife, and throughout the years he's been abusing his daughter and locking her up in the basement where he dismembered her mom. The murderer is his stepson from his first wife, who ran away as a kid and came back years later disguised as a farmhand, who was suspicious of why another woman was posing as his mother, and axed his stepfather to death. Inspector Brackenreid even said he would do his best to avert the death penalty for the stepson, saying about his stepfather, "Bastard bloody deserved it."
</li><li> The victim in "Downstairs, Upstairs" was the master of a wealthy household who used his position to rape the maids in his employ without consequences, dismissing them without a thought if they became pregnant (a situation similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GosfordPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GosfordPark">Gosford Park</a></em> above. When interviewed, the murderer said he did not regret it in the slightest.
</li><li> In season 4, the victims of "All Tattered and Torn" are three men that were guilty or accomplice of raping a young woman and escaped justice years ago. The murderer is a former cop who was obsessed with the case and executed them.
</li><li> In season 6, three young women are beaten and murdered by drowning. You feel less sympathetic when it is discovered that they accidentally killed another girl by repeatedly submerging her in cold water to "cleanse" her of her love for her Persian teacher and that one of them was also blackmailing her employer with threats of publishing news of his marriage to a Native woman in the newspaper.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many episodes of this show contain these certainly, however the episode "Smoked" has an interesting twist. Because of evidence found during the autopsy, the entire team, and the viewer, believes their victim is a serial killer who murdered dozens of women who look like his wife. Gibbs and Fornell believe the wife to have found out and killed the husband, and they are sympathetic during the interview. Then, in the last five minutes, due to some more forensic magic, it is determined that the husband was completely innocent and SHE is the serial killer.
</li><li> <em>NCIS</em> also did this in the backstory with Gibbs's murder of Pedro Hernandez (in cold blood and premeditated), who had murdered Gibbs's wife and daughter earlier. At first, this is only sporadically brought up in flashbacks (particularly during the "Hiatus" arc while Gibbs recovers from trauma and memory loss). It later comes back to haunt him in the "Rule 51" arc concluding season 7, where the idea of vengeance is also heavily deconstructed.
</li><li> Another example is the episode "Caged", where a guard in a women's prison gets stabbed to death, and the team must find out who killed the guard. The guard is blackmailing an inmate's high school daughter for sex. It's implied that said inmate (who had less than one year left on her sentence and wants to be a mother to her kids) stabbed the guard, but another inmate (on a 175-year sentence), who McGee was sent to get a confession from, confesses to the murder. The team agrees that they won't lose any sleep over that.
</li><li> Two men are killed in very gruesome ways, by Ducky's girlfriend to attract his attention. She points out that they were unpleasant adulterers and deserved to die. Then this is subverted as Ducky proceeds to point out that they didn't deserve to die any more than she deserves to be their judge jury and executioner.
</li><li> Even though the murderer isn't a sympathetic one, few are sorry when Eli David is shot. Said man is the one who twisted Ari (his own son) into a murderer and a terrorist, and treated Ziva more like a tool for his own goals than like a daughter. One of his last actions is murdering a journalist to keep his own return to the USA secret.
</li><li> Even the birth of NCIS came about with one of these. The two-parter <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em> episode "Ice Queen"/"Meltdown" that served as the NCIS pilot introduced Gibbs and DiNozzo investigating the death of Lt. Singer and her five-month fetus, the token "Evil Witch" on <em>JAG</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NUMB3RS">NUMB3RS</a></em> series finale features the murders of two drug dealers and a dangerous drunk driver (who were assassinated with a Glock stolen from Don Eppes, an error that could get Don fired, and then passed along to a chain of wanna-be vigilantes). The motives are so numerous that they have to turn to social media to identify the killer of the drug dealers, and they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">never do find out who killed the drunk driver</a>.
<ul><li> A non-murder example takes place earlier in the series when the son of a controversial music producer is kidnapped. When Colby tries to ask the father if he has any enemies, the man suggests he "pick up your mugbook and pick a page". (Fortunately, some later hints dropped by the kidnapper give the team the information they need to zero in on a suspect.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason">Perry Mason</a></em>: Most but not all of this show's episodes deal with trying to identify the murderer of an unpleasant person when there's no shortage of people suspected to have killed the bastard.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersInSpace">Power Rangers in Space</a></em> alludes to this in "Flashes of Darkonda". When Darkonda screams in agony after the strength serum he's consumed has caused him to start melting, Cassie asks who would do that sort of thing to Darkonda. T.J. quips "Probably about half the galaxy."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> has featured its share of these. One notable example is the fashion mogul couple from "Black And Tan: A Crime of Fashion". The husband is revealed to have stolen some of his recent designs from their assistant and is having an affair with one of their models. The wife is incredibly mean to everyone, including the aforementioned assistant. In an interesting twist, it turns out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they killed each other. The husband poisoned his wife, but it took longer than it should have due to her bulimia. By the time it did kill her, she'd already killed him through electrocution.</span>
</li><li> An episode of the old <em>Superior Court</em> courtroom procedural had an episode where the town bully ended up dead. Queue no less than six different witnesses other than the defendant killing the guy, motives ranging from the guy raping a couple of the women, to revenge for the bully burning down houses and shops, to self-defense.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirteenReasonsWhy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirteenReasonsWhy">13 Reasons Why</a></em>: Season 3 of the show centers around the mystery of who killed Bryce Walker. Bryce in the previous seasons had raped <em>two</em> girls, one of which later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToSuicide">killed herself</a>, has gaslit his emotionally devastated friend Justin so much that he was powerless against him even when he knew he had raped his girlfriend, was a general bully and asshole, beat up Clay when the latter confronted him with the truth, and got off almost completely scot-free from the trial that made up season 2. The general reaction by even the <em>viewers</em> when the first teaser for the season revealed this was extremely positive.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToCatchTheUncatchable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ToCatchTheUncatchable">To Catch The Uncatchable</a></em>: In this Hong Kong comedy detective show, a majority of the victims are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> and should <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil">had it coming to them</a>. The female protagonist's previous boss had several affairs and tried to rape the protagonist as well. Turns out his jilted lover was the one to kill him. Another man was a cult leader who put drugs into his believers' drinks so they would follow his orders and would later force the drugs down a believer's throat for disobeying him and also going out with his son. His wife tried to stop him from killing the girl and accidentally pushed him too hard, causing him to fall off the building. There was a woman who was a model who chased after men, then dumped them after she had exploited them for all they were worth. She was pushed off the stairs by a fan of hers after she insulted him for being worthless.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfCloth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ATouchOfCloth">A Touch of Cloth</a></em>: Parodied with the first episode's second murder victim, 'sushi despot' Aiden Hawkchurck. This walking turd was <strong>so</strong> despised that his featured magazine covers had headlines like "Enemymaker" and "Someone kill him already!". Even random radio broadcasters celebrate his death right after the protagonists muse that there must be a million suspects.

She survives, but the central characters are all each suspected of doing it not only because they were there when it happened, but because Trina was such a jerk to each of them earlier on in the episode and each flashback about each character's potential motive (those mostly blown wide out of proportion) does not make any effort to make her likable in any way to the point that viewers probably <em>wished</em> she'd died.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhodunnitUK" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WhodunnitUK">Whodunnit? (UK)</a></em>: Most victims. In the most extreme case, every suspect tried to claim credit for killing the victim (a South American dictator) and the mystery was to work out who was telling the truth rather than who was lying.

</li><li> The <em>Julia Tinnberg</em> mysteries, five radio drama series about a crime novelist with a tendency to encounter real crimes, are practically built on this trope. The murder victim is always a despicable person that very few people actually like or even tolerate... curiously enough, they never show up in person to have any actual dialogue. Either they're dead before the story begins, or the body is discovered in the first chapter, and we only get to know the victim through the (usually negative) descriptions of the rest of the characters. The fourth series is the only one to break the norm here; not only is the victim a sympathetic person but she actually appears in a couple of scenes to talk to the protagonists before she's murdered.

She dies at the end of the first act, and if it wasn't for the "three blind mice" motif leading to a high chance of another death, there wouldn't be much of a mystery because it would be hard to <em>care</em> who killed her. The first "blind mouse", Maureen Lyon, was also this (although in her case she died before the play's beginning). She was an abusive foster parent to the three Corrigan brothers, which lead to one of them dying (her husband also took part in it, but died in prison). It's suspected that the killer is targeting people who were involved in the Corrigan case (Mrs. Boyle was the judge who placed the Corrigans with the Lyons), out of revenge for the youngest brother's death.
