He may have different reasons, and find different ways to do it, which may or may not work. The type of hero that usually gets put in this kind of situation is often an average worker, or even outright poor, as a person from the higher classes of society usually have relatively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections">easy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">methods</a> to exempt themselves from serving while avoiding the negative repercussions in the process.

</p><ul><li> He simply is not willing to risk his life for his country
</li><li> He does not want to fight
</li><li> He objects for ideological reasons
</li></ul><p>Possible ways to dodge:
</p><ol><li> Claim you're too sick. Maybe all you need for this option is a note by your doctor; but you may also go through some pain, which can go as far as self-mutilation.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FauxYay">Act like/openly claim you're gay</a>. This may have other repercussions, though. (This mainly applied to the US before and during the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" era, when openly gay citizens were barred from military service. The repeal of that policy in favor of accepting the openly gay to serve has closed off this escape route, making it a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> outside of period works.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingInsanity">Pretend to be crazy.</a>
</li><li> Commit a lesser crime.
</li><li> Flee to another country. For Americans, this often meant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Canada">Canada</a>; for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WestGermany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WestGermany">West Germany</a>, there was the option of West Berlin, since men living there were exempted from the draft for complicated legal reasons.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0f4ow');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0f4ow" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0f4ow');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Berlin was considered occupied territory after World War II and was administered by the Allied Powers (the U.S., the USSR, the United Kingdom and France). As such, West German law did not fully apply to West Berlin.</span>
</li><li> Earlier forms of military conscriptions, e. g. that in France during the Revolutionary and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheNapoleonicWars">The Napoleonic Wars</a> and that in the US during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, offered a legal way to avoid the draft that no longer exists: hire a substitute to serve in your place. Of course only the more affluent could take advantage of that option, especially when a war wore on and the casualty rates rose, causing the fees men asked to serve as substitutes to rise considerably.
</li><li> Declare yourself a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector">"conscientious objector"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and convince a military tribunal that you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">objecting for ideological reasons</a> (easier for members of certain religions, such as Quakers). There is a very chequered history of countries (a) allowing you the right to do this (although it's in the UN's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheLawsAndCustomsOfWar">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>) and (b) actually abiding by it if they do. Some objectors agree to serve as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMedic">The Medic</a>, as stretcher bearers, or in other non-combatant roles. Others are delegated for non-military work that can be every bit as dangerous as combat - fighting forest fires, disaster or marine rescue services, tending quarantined patients in contagious-disease wards - but doesn't force them to <em>hurt</em> anyone.
</li><li> Volunteer to fight for armed forces of another country. For some people, the objection is not so much objection to fighting as much as fighting for a particular country. Many people avoided draft in the country that they were citizens of and went to war as soldiers for another country. A particularly glaring example is a certain Austro-Hungarian citizen named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> who avoided draft into his own country's army by volunteering for the German Army during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>. He did so as a matter of principle as a German (broadly defined) nationalist.
</li><li> Get a job that makes you more valuable to the war effort as a worker than as a soldier.

That means volunteering in a unit with little to do with actual military, such as National Guard, Coast Guard or Border Guard, or pulling the strings and/or gaming the system by getting yourself in a non-fighting position, such as company clerk, vehicle mechanic or drill instructor. Of course, even this isn't foolproof, as in the US, the Coast Guard and National Guard can both be (and especially in recent years, often are) mobilized to the front lines, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear">Soldiers at the Rear</a> might find themselves on the front due to the needs of the service or surprise enemy attacks.
</p><p>This is a trope that may become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope">Dead Horse Trope</a> in the next few decades, as more and more western states abolish conscription. There is still draft registration in the United States, but it is so politically unacceptable that the laws regarding registration are not enforced. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15v2r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15v2r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15v2r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The "Selective Service" system requires all eligible males between the ages of 18-25 to register for the draft. Failure to do so is punishable, but few, if any, are ever punished. Resident aliens, on the other hand, <em>must</em> register or face deportation, and this <em>is</em> enforced. Additionally, draft registration is <em>mandatory</em> to receive federal student aid, or to apply for a government job. There's also the argument that the US military <em>prefers</em> an all-volunteer army, as the quality of troops tends to be much higher when the troops <em>want</em> to be there.</span> Whether American conscription is ever revived is debatable. The US has proven it can fight protracted wars without conscription, but the full impact of this has yet to be seen and a future war with higher casualties may force the draft to be revived. This is also something of a required trope for the "chickenhawk" variant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">Miles Gloriosus</a>: the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarHawk">War Hawk</a> who claims the nation's military is their greatest pride, while quietly shoving a heavily doctored medical report under the table.

(It was the grandfather who insisted that he'd do this. But the artist's father found doing it was so terrible, he preferred to be drafted the second time around.)

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>, the main characters try to help a local boy avoid the draft. They make him take amphetamines to speed up his heartbeat and fake a heart condition. The doctor sees through this and keeps him for further examination, which reveals the fraud.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy">Laurel and Hardy</a> movie <em>Great Guns</em>, the eponymous duo were servants to a rich family. When a man from said family was drafted, the family (not the draftee himself) tried this.
</li><li> In a Finnish military farce movie <em>Vääpeli Körmy</em> (<em>Sergeant Major Körmy</em>) a young man tries to avoid draft by pretending to have so bad eyes he can't even see the eye test. When the doctor says he will be released from service and asks him to bring him a form from the third pile by the wall the man makes the mistake by walking to the papers and bringing in the right one.

</p><ul><li> There's the joke about the fox, the bunny and the bear who want to avoid conscription. The fox thinks he is going into military intelligence and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">pretends to be stupid</a>. The bunny thinks he is going to be a spy and cuts off his ears. The bear thinks he is going to become a fighter and pulls his teeth and claws... then is rejected because he is too fat (or has flat feet).
</li><li> A guy asked his older friend how he managed to dodge the draft. "Do you see that tree over there?" asks the latter. "Yes", says the former. "Well, I don't".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2yp3w');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2yp3w" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2yp3w');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Implying that he faked being blind.</span>
</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Literature</span>
</p><ul><li> Thomas Mann's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConfessionsOfFelixKrull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ConfessionsOfFelixKrull">Confessions of Felix Krull</a></em> subverts this: The character knows that the doctors are very generous in declaring even sick people fit for the army; so he instead fakes being a sick but enthusiastic guy, who plays down his obvious-but-fake maladies. It works.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoodSoldierSvejk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGoodSoldierSvejk">The Good Soldier vejk</a></em>, set right before and during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, there are a variety of men trying to avoid conscription by appearing ill, resorting to injecting gasoline into their legs and other outlandish methods (all played for comedy). The army has a special "hospital" for malingerers, where they put them on a strict diet, and, among other things, wrap them in wet sheets - even the ones who really have tuberculosis.
<ul><li> Subverted by the protagonist, who volunteers, despite suffering from rheumatism so bad that he can't even walk, and he's wheeled to the recruitment office by his charwoman. And then he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KafkaKomedy">promptly sent</a> to the above-mentioned special hospital ward.
</li><li> Later into the book, one-year volunteer Marek<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3fa6r');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3fa6r" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3fa6r');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">One-year volunteer - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratuitousGerman">Einjährigfreiwilliger</a> - is his rank in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSoundOfMartialMusic">Austrian military</a>, a designation for a "reserve officer candidate", he was actually drafted.</span> is introduced, who describes his failed attempts to catch rheumatism - he slept in gutters in rain and bathed in icy river - which only hardened him to cold, so he felt perfectly fit after spending whole night sleeping on snow. He also tried to catch a venereal disease, visiting brothel daily, but he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/STDImmunity">remained immune</a>. Finally he met a disabled soldier who injected him with something which made him suffer a "real rheumatism" so he can hardly move.

</div></li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimDorsey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TimDorsey">Tim Dorsey</a> novel <em>Orange Crush</em>, the Lt Governor of Florida was revealed to have never registered for the draft. To avoid the political fallout of him being seen as a draft dodger (even though there was no war in which the government was actually drafting people to fight in at the time), his handlers arrange for him to join the National Guard, intending to file paperwork claiming that he had an injury that prevented him from serving in the field. Unfortunately, said paperwork had not been filed by the time his unit was called up and sent to Kosovo.
</li><li> An Iranian in <em>On Wings of Eagles</em> avoided service in the Shah's army by pretending to have an incurable twitching disease. After twitching for hours in front of numerous doctors (which turned out to be rather exhausting) he eventually got a medical exemption.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a> in <em>Dave Barry Turns 50</em>, mentions a guy who wore the same underwear for several days, not even removing them to go to the bathroom(!), so that the doctors reject him solely to avoid them getting near him. He also says that to him, this guy was quite a bit more honorable than Henry Kissinger.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeMilligan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SpikeMilligan">Spike Milligan</a> averted this trope.

</li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Real Life</span>
</p><ul><li> In real life, young Korean celebrities will often bribe doctors to give them disqualifying diagnoses, with the idea that serving two years conscription would be inconvenient and damage their careers. Usually, the truth will somehow come out in the press and the celebrity will be shamed into fulfilling their obligation or see their careers take a hard hit.
<ul><li> Swallowing rolled-up bits of foil before the medical examination is suggested as a good way to avoid conscription, supposedly because the foil will show up as ulcers in x-rays (this technique never works).
</li><li> Korean soccer players have been rumored to intentionally damage their own shoulders (chronic shoulder injuries being one cause for exemption) in the hopes that they can avoid military service and continue their athletic training instead.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 19th century, some people in Egypt put out one of their eyes in order to escape the army. It was followed by an order to form a regiment out of one-eyed men.
</li><li> Italian history offers three examples of this:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>; many young Romans attempted to avoid getting drafted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fingore">cutting off their thumbs</a> so that they couldn't hold a sword properly. This behavior was often punished swiftly and brutally, but it became so widespread during the migration period that Emperor Theodosius passed a law to allow thumb-less to serve and ultimately beginning to replace Romans with barbarians due to the population's lack of motivation to serve in the military and increasingly severe losses.
</li><li> After the unification and the introduction of conscription into the former Kingdom of Two Sicilies (who did not have conscription), part of the dodgers willingly injured themselves to be disqualified. This had a mixed rate of success, as it would take <em>crippling injuries</em> to be disqualified;
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, already conscripted and reactivated soldiers would sometimes shoot themselves in a hand or foot during battle to be sent home, or at least in the rear echelons. This <em>always</em> failed and resulted in punishment, as Austro-Hungarian weapons used larger bullets than Italian ones, allowing the medics to easily recognize if the wound had actually been produced by enemy fire.
<ul><li> There was also a practice called "waving", which involved deliberately sticking an extremity out of the trench in hopes that the enemy would hit it non-lethally. It had mixed levels of success.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> During the Vietnam War, there were quite a few American athletes who managed to have "injuries" that prevented them from being drafted yet somehow failed to impair them from continuing to play professional sports.
</li><li> There are a few examples on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DarwinAwards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/DarwinAwards">Darwin Awards</a></em> site about people trying to injure themselves so they'll be ineligible for the draft and succeeding a little too well.

Apparently, the gay unit was a fiction made up by the military.

</p><ul><li> A rather funny aversion from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RichardFeynman">Richard Feynman</a>'s autobiography: he was denied entry on the grounds of being a loony, simply because he would occasionally hold one-sided conversations with his deceased wife. Also, he answered honestly the question of whether he thought people were staring at him. There are a bunch of people waiting in the room to take their test, but it's a mostly empty room with nothing to look at except the people who are currently being tested, so Feynman drew the logical conclusion.
<ul><li> His guess was dead-on too, at least before other people started looking. And he reported each new person too. The psychiatrist, not even looking up from his clipboard to verify the number, thought he was a narcissist.
</li><li> Another version goes that everything was going smoothly until the shrink asked him what he thought was the value of a human life, to which Feynman responded "64". When asked why he picked 64 and not, say, 72, he replied "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">'Cause then you would have asked me "Why 72?"</a>." The upshot of all this is that Feynman later wrote a letter to the draft board protesting his failed psych-eval, on the grounds that he was insane enough not to want to take advantage of it. See below.

</li></ul></li><li> Advocated by Abbie Hoffman in <em>Steal This Book</em>:
<div class="indent"> When you get your invite to join the army, there are lots of ways you can prepare yourself mentally. Begin by staggering up to a cop and telling him you don't know who you are or where you live. He'll arrange for you to be chauffeured to the nearest mental hospital. There you repeat your performance, dropping the clue that you have used LSD in the past, but you aren't sure if you're on it now or not. In due time, they'll put you up for the night. When morning comes, you bounce out of bed, remember who you are, swear you'll never drop acid again and thank everyone who took care of you. Within a few hours, you'll be discharged. Don't be uptight about thinking how they'll lock you up forever cause you really are nuts. The hospitals measure victories by how quickly they can throw you out the door. They are all overcrowded anyway. In most areas, a one-night stand in a mental hospital is enough to convince the shrink at the induction center that you're capable of eating the flesh of a colonel. Just before you go, see a sympathetic psychiatrist and explain your sad mental shape. He'll get verification that you did time in a hospital and include it in his letter, that you'll take along to the induction center.

</li></ul></li></ul><p><span class="asscaps">Urban Legends</span>
</p><ul><li> There is the story of the Saxon who came to draft smiling and giggling asking when he is going to get his gun. When asked about anything he just said he didn't care and just wanted to be handed his gun already. The examiners became incredibly creeped out when he started whispering "Bang. Hehe." and he became angry about all the examinations and shouted "I just came here to finally get my damned gun. GIVE ME MY GUN ALREADY!" In the end they told him his gun would come in the mail and shooed him home. Security was tightened and laughs between friends were shared respectively.
</li><li> Sweden, being one of the last countries in the world to practice universal conscription even in peacetime, has a rich <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OralTradition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OralTradition">Oral Tradition</a> of stories of this type, particularly since psychiatric disability is one of the easiest "outs" to fake. Some are purely humorous (My buddy rolled himself up in the rug and said he was a hot dog!), others have a moral ending (My cousin claimed he was narcoleptic, so they took his driver's license.) The abolition of conscription means that this tradition is slowly dying. It was dying beforehand, too — the end of the Cold War didn't mean the end of formal universal conscription, but it <em>did</em> result in a massive drop of how many actually were drafted, with a corresponding increasing ease in not being drafted.
</li><li> In Finland universal draft for men is still going strong and until relatively recently was very difficult to dodge. Back when it was extremely hard to get out there was more sympathy for dodgers than today, and from those days there comes this amusing little anecdote / urban legend: When a man came to the army, he kept pretending to ride an invisible scooter everywhere, making motor sounds with his mouth and holding his arms extended in front of him. No matter how many disciplinary measures were taken on him, and even after a couple of beatings from his fellow privates he just kept going relentlessly. Finally his superiors had enough of his antics and had a psychiatrist declare him unfit for military service. At the gates of the garrison he suddenly stopped, mimed taking a key from his imaginary scooter and handed it to one of the MPs saying: "I hereby relinquish the army vehicle to your care, sir", and walked away normally, whistling happily as he went.
<ul><li> Another version of the story has the man break in laughter when someone ask him to give a ride with the bike, thus proving that he is not insane.

The protagonist, Brion, fits the last category and fakes being crippled to avoid serving in a war he doesn't believe in, but ends up revealing his true status and is arrested and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead">executed</a> for it.

The kid used to be exempt because he was in college but lost his exemption due to a stupid anti-war stunt. Unfortunately Don does not have the right connections to accomplish this and it looks like the kid will have to flee to Canada.

</li><li> The dialogue of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlicesRestaurant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlicesRestaurant">Alice's Restaurant</a>" claims that singing this song to the draft board, alone or in groups, will convince the board that you're crazy, gay, and/or part of an organized protest against conscription.
<ul><li> Although these days, when Arlo Guthrie sings it live, that bit's been changed to say that singing this song to the draft board, alone or in groups, will prompt the board to make a sarcastic comment about your old-fashioned taste in music.
</li><li> There's a double subversion earlier in the song. When Arlo is called up, he fakes being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">murderous lunatic</a> during his psychiatric assessment.

Daffy's approach is simply to run and hide from anyone trying to draft him until the drafts stop. Unfortunately, the person trying to give him the draft card, the aptly named "Little Man from the Draft Board", is about as persistent as Droopy.

</li><li> Gregg Allman took a more drastic measure. When he got his draft notice, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheAllmanBrothersBand">he and his brother, Duane</a>, had a "foot-shooting" party.

When he went to his draft physical, he claimed he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his gun. They bought it and he was rejected.
</li><li> Musician Bobby Keys (best known as the sax player for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones">The Rolling Stones</a>) was actually accused of being a draft dodger because he never showed up for his draft physicals, as he was on the road playing and never received the letters. He was advised by the head of his local draft board to try and enlist before the Army caught up with him. He did so, and was rejected due to a medical history of ulcers.

<ul><li> College deferments were controversial in the U.S. during the Vietnam-era.

</li></ul></li><li> Many places and times have had the 'war-important industries exemption', where workers in specific industries were defined as having a valid exemption. Obviously, <em>getting</em> a job like that in response to a draft would be impractical, but it was sometimes necessary to find people and organizations to vouch for you being an experienced worker in a relevant industry, especially if the industry had less intensive periods.
<ul><li> In the United States during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, there was an order that all men, even if they had previously deferred their conscription, must either get a job essential to the industry of the country and war effort, or join the armed services. The team owners of America's baseball leagues tried (both times) to claim that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Baseball">baseball</a> was an "essential industry," in an effort to keep their players from being drafted. This claim was rejected (both times).

The main reason for this are flaws in the Russian conscription system  enlistment offices are doing everything to get as many recruits as possible (meaning that without proper legal preparation you can be conscripted even with serious physical issues), and intensive hazing (<a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedovshchina">dedovshchina<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) leading to many cases of suicide and even accidental murder.
</li><li> Some Russian people buy fake PhD diplomas, as in Russia PhD holders are exempt from draft. Sellers claim that those diplomas would withstand any kind of scrutiny. Validity of that claim is hard to estimate.
</li><li> Finland has deliberately made draft dodging almost impossible. Fleeing abroad is no option, as to apply for passport one has to present his military discharge certificate. Likewise, neither homosexualism nor committing a lesser crime qualify <em>per sé</em> an exemption. Some 80% of Finnish men complete their tour of duty, with 14% being washed out in service, 2% completing the civilian service and 3% being exempted for medical reasons. A minority will end up in prison on refusal.

</li><li> Civil rights leader Malcolm X did a similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a> when he told his draft board he wanted to be sent down South, so he could organize the other blacks and "kill us some crackers". He was declared "mentally disqualified for military service".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry">Dave Barry</a> recounted in his book <em>Dave Barry Turns 50</em> that he dodged the draft by claiming to be a pacifist. He credited his father being a Presbyterian minister and his college being traditionally Quaker as what got him the exemption. He also mentions a guy who deliberately shit himself for several days without changing clothes so the doctor would reject him solely to avoid coming near him (and as far as he's concerned, that guy was still more honorable than Henry Kissinger).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MuhammadAli">Muhammad Ali</a> famously insisted on going to jail and paying fines over being drafted into service for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a>, which caused his boxing license to be temporarily revoked.
