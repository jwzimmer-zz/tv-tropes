But years have passed, and now they're grown up (or at least in High School).

<ul><li> In the original OAV animated version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Ah! My Goddess</a></em>, Keiichi and Belldandy met when they were children. After Belldandy made a promise with him, it was considered as she made a contract when she didn't have her qualification yet. She had to erase Keiichi's memories of her and promised to return to him once she gained her qualification.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiYoriAoshi">Ai Yori Aoshi</a></em> there's a broken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise">Childhood Marriage Promise</a> but she wants to find him. When she does he doesn't remember her at first. There are flashbacks, not to the first time they met but while they were friends as kids together.
</li><li> Played for painful drama with Kouichi Sakakibara and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Izumi Akazawa</span> in the anime adaptation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Another">Another</a></em>. Though they only met a few years prior to the story, the forgetfulness is justified since <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kouichi was only in Yomiyama for the funeral of his aunt, a time erased from everyone's memories due to the events of the curse. Akazawa remembers seconds before her death, and right before dying she asks Kouichi if he remembers too. He doesn't and tells her so, and Akazawa calls him out on it.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia">Axis Powers Hetalia</a></em>, Germany is hinted to be Holy Roman Empire, Italy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest">Love Interest</a> when they were little. It's not clear whether Italy believes them to be the same person or not, but Germany, at least, appears to have forgotten about their shared childhood. He might have remembered in the Valentine's Day strip, but that plotline has been abandoned for years now.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CellsAtWork">Cells at Work!</a></em>, it turns out Red Blood Cell and Neutrophill already met each other when they were still an erythroblast and a myelocyte (basically children cells) when a bacteria attacked the bone marrow where they were at. However, they only met briefly that one time and don't see each other again until they are adults. In present time, Red Blood Cell briefly does contemplate if that myelocyte is Neutrophill but quickly dismisses it as too much of a coincidence.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeadmanWonderland">Deadman Wonderland</a>,</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForMurderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForMurderer">Ganta</a> meets <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">Shiro</a> in prison; she instantly starts acting like his friend and claims they've met before, but he has no idea what she's talking about. It takes a while for him to remember that they were actually friends when they were about four, prior to Tokyo's near-complete destruction.

</li><li> The last panel of chapter 971 states that Shinichi and Ran met <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Masumi Sera, her mother Mary Sera and her brothers (Shuichi Akai and Shuukichi Haneda)</span> 10 years ago, but he had forgotten it. The panel is the moment when he <em>does</em> remember, and the following chapters describe the whole situation.
</li><li> In the 21th movie, it's shown that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Heiji Hattori and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfProclaimedLoveInterest">Self-Proclaimed Love Interest</a> Momiji Ooka</span> met as children and made a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkySwear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinkySwear">Pinky Swear</a>.

Many years later in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, the two briefly meet and don't recognize each other. Granted, this may be partially because Goku has noticeably aged, while Arale, being a robot, has not aged at all; it's also been roughly thirty years since the two of them last saw each other. Subverted when they run into each other in a later episode, and they eventually do recognize each other when Arale uses the same headbutt she defeated General Blue with on Vegeta.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FairyTail">Fairy Tail</a></em>: In the Avatar arc, when Natsu rescues Happy, Carla, Wendy, and Sherria from Bluenote Stinger, he has no idea who Bluenote is. Everyone incredulously asks how he forgot him, considering the last time they met in the Tenrou Island arc, Bluenote curb-stomped and almost killed them before Gildarts came to their rescue.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FatePrototype" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FatePrototype">Fate/Prototype</a></em>: In the prequel, <em>Fragments of Sky Silver</em>, Ayaka Sajyou as a little girl met and talked to Saber, but after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her own sister Manaka killed several people and tried to murder her</span>, she was traumatized and blocked out these events. In the present, when Ayaka summons Saber, she doesn't remember him while he remembers her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>'s Tohru met Yuki when they were younger, but it isn't until later on in the series he realizes she was the same girl. He believes she doesn't remember but actually the memory was very important to her, even though she never learns that Yuki was the boy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCureSplashStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCureSplashStar">Futari wa Pretty Cure Splash★Star</a></em>: Both Cures met briefly five years prior to the events of the series and forgot.
</li><li> A flashback in chapter 18 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Horimiya" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Horimiya">Horimiya</a></em> revealed that Miyamura saw Hori messing with Sengoku during the winter of their final year of middle school. Neither of them are aware of this in the present.

The event <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheCutie">was so traumatic for the then-young Rohan</a> that he eventually used his stand <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInducedAmnesia">to erase the memory from his mind</a>, and it didn't come back until a Buddhist priest that knew both Rohan <em>and</em> Reimi tells him about it. After this, Rohan goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">It's Personal</a> and decides to join the hunt for Kira from then on.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureJoJolion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureJoJolion">Part 8</a>, Yasuho <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">met Holy and Kira as a result of an encounter with a rock animal when she was 13</span>, but it isn't until she meets Josuke that she remembers.

He stops at a park when his tires go flat, only to have his future lover walk by, inquire, and then start dishing out life lessons about the obstacles kids must get through before tattling to the patrolman. Years later Nowaki remembers the encounter and mentions it to Hiroki, but neither realizes it was each other.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KaguyaSamaLoveIsWar">Kaguya-sama: Love Is War</a></em>: Kaguya and Shirogane actually met very early on in their freshman year. While Shirogane remembers their interactions quite well (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as he should, considering that he fell in love about a week into the semester</span>), Kaguya has absolutely no memory of all the times he talked to her due to how little of an impression he made on her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is why Shirogane insists so hard on sticking to his perfect student persona (even after it ends up getting him hospitalized for exhaustion). Kaguya only started paying attention to him when he followed Momo's advice of acting more confident than he actually was.</span>

At the very end of the series we find out why, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since Kokutou was actually talking to Shiki's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality">third personality</a>, who was unknown even to her at that point in time.</span>

After seeing Miu defeat the thug trying to assault a kind old lady, both Ryuto and Kenichi vowed to become strong, but Kenichi forgot the fact. Miu apparently recognized him right away, but didn't feel the need to bring it up when they meet again.
</li><li> Chizuru from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiToBoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiToBoku">Kimi to Boku</a></em> played at the park with Yuki once when they were younger. When they meet again at age seventeen Yuki doesn't remember Chizuru and believes him to be delusional. It turns out Chizuru was really friends with Yuuta, Yuki's identical twin brother.

A year later, months after Victor becomes his coach, Yuri assumes Victor must have forgotten about that meeting. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReveal">However,</a> the <em>true</em> example of this was <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><em>after</em> that at the closing banquet for the Grand Prix. And <em><strong>Yuri</strong></em> is the one who actually forgot. He got really drunk, danced with his fellow skaters (pole dance, break dance and tango), hit on Victor while begging at him to be his coach, in which heavily implied to be the event where the Russian fell in love with Yuri that would make all his touchy-feely acts towards him made sense throughout the series before Episode 7's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigDamnKiss">The Big Damn Kiss</a> and becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficialCouple">Official Couple</a>. Unfortunately the next morning, Yuri didn't remember anything and it wasn't until nearly one year later that he learned anything had happened at all. By that banquet, Victor knew Yuri's existence beforehand even before the Nishigori triplets uploaded the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantHumiliationJustAddYoutube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantHumiliationJustAddYoutube">video that showed Yuri mimicking his latest routine</a> that he used as a ticket to take off-season, go to Japan in order to become Yuri's coach and shaping him up for the Grand Prix, fulfilling Yuri's drunken plea back at the banquet as well as his personal reasons to become closer and win Yuri's heart. About the first meeting back after the Grand Prix and before the banquet? Turns out that the moment Yuri turned down Victor's offer of commemorative photo, Victor started to steal glances at the Japanese. The audience only lead to believe that Victor forget the encounter at the first episode due of Yuri being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator">Unreliable Narrator</a>, while at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreatherEpisode">Breather Episode</a> nine episodes later we have the true context of the scene (and the story in general) by Victor's perspective.</span>
</li><li> Another example of this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Yurio</a> and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Otabek</a>. Five years ago during the summer camp, Yurio made a strong impression on Otabek, the Russian was going through some difficult stuff at that time and didn't really pay much attention to the Kazakh, forgetting about him. During the pre-Grand Prix where both are qualified, Otabek seeks a way to approach the former and become friends with him.

<ul><li> Two of these occurred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANewHope">A New Hope</a></em> due to new information <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">revealed in the prequel movies.</a> First of all, C-3PO didn't know who Obi-Wan Kenobi was, but R2-D2 did, and he didn't remember them, although he clearly knew them both when he was younger, making his interactions with them in the prequels somewhat confusing. This was partially explained at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>, where Bail Organa orders C-3PO's memory wiped, which erases his memories of the entire prequel trilogy. In Obi-Wan's case, it's possible he <em>did</em> recognize them and just didn't say anything. This would be consistent with his characterization in the first trilogy because he's an old Jedi Master familiar with the mysterious ways of the Force, and he was trying to shield Luke from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">dark secret about his father.</a>
</li><li> Also, Luke's aunt and uncle didn't seem to remember C-3PO either, although he had worked for their family for years in the time between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones">Attack of the Clones</a></em>. Owen may not have been telling Luke the truth about that, however, much like he was lying to Luke about the fate of his father in order to keep him sheltered. (The hologram of Leia probably made him decide against mentioning that he knew where the droids had come from.) Of course, it's just as likely that they simply didn't recognize C-3PO; it <em>had</em> been over 20 years and the protocol droid didn't have his iconic gold finish when he left their service.

</li><li> In "Friendship University", the Flim-Flam brothers have no idea who Rarity is, since the last time they met was in "The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000", a really long time ago, and they didn't really talk to each other.

</li><li> "Three Gems and a Baby" reveals that Garnet did once show Steven that she was a Fusion of Ruby and Sapphire, thinking that he was also a Fusion. Justified as he was only a baby at the time, so he wouldn't be able to remember it.
