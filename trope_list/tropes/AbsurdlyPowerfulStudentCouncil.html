And of course, each school is subordinate to the power of state and federal courts. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishEducationSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishEducationSystem">England and Wales</a>, it lies with the Headteacher, the Board of Governors, and the Local Education Authority. Other jurisdictions, including Scotland, may have their own arrangements. To create the illusion of students having power over their lives at school, student councils are forged. In truth, these groups are largely figurehead posts: the only real power they have is superficial, the actual election of these groups is basically one big popularity contest, and the only benefit is a student council slot on your college application under "extracurricular activities" and an extra picture in the yearbook.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In fiction, student council is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">Serious Business</a>, with power worthy of corruption and abuse in the hands of those with evil in their hearts. Council members have unparalleled freedom — they do as they please on campus, invent arbitrary rules that punish the masses, and give themselves and their allies special privileges. No member of the staff dare rebuke them. In fact, the staff may rarely appear at all (see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool">Two-Teacher School</a>). Occasionally, their power will be checked by others, such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolNewspaperNewshound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolNewspaperNewshound">School Newspaper Newshound</a>. In the event that the student council is <em>not</em> corrupt and seeks to use their powers for good rather than evil, their rival will be the actual school administration, who will often butt heads with the council over the administration's own corruption/tyranny.
</p><p>One thing that may or may not overlap with this trope is how the Yearbook Committee seems to have supreme power over the yearbook's content, despite the fact that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> schools, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExecutiveMeddling">administration would step in</a> so that the students in danger of being hurt by the pictures would be out of harm's way.

</p><p>Note that in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseEducationSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseEducationSystem">Japanese schools</a>, this is an exaggeration of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, as the Student Councils actually <em>do</em> have power over the approval and funding of student clubs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolClubsAreSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolClubsAreSeriousBusiness">School Clubs Are Serious Business</a> is a real thing in Japan, as they're meant to prepare students for the high-pressure work environment into which they'll eventually be dumped, and students are strongly encouraged to join at least one club. And just like in their future jobs, students are expected to show utmost loyalty to their club: once you join, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResignationsNotAccepted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResignationsNotAccepted">you're there until you graduate</a>. Likewise, in private schools in the United Kingdom, prefect councils often perform the same functions that an honour council fulfills at a university, and any year's prefects are assigned to keep order in the teacher's absence. Are you starting to see the clout Student Council can hold? (More details in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> section below.)

</p><p>It also isnt exclusive to councils. For example, since a lot of works use a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoTeacherSchool">Two-Teacher School</a>, cheerleading is usually run by the head cheerleader, when in real life, there would be a coach that comes up with the routines and decides who is on the squad.

<ul><li> Somehow the school council in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiOreLoveMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiOreLoveMe">Ai Ore! Love Me!</a></em> can keep a student held hostage, in a cage too, until the local male school gets a better reputation.
</li><li> Turned on its head with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AngelBeats">Angel Beats!</a></em>. Since the show is set to an equivalent of Purgatory, the Student Council represents subordinates of the Creator of said world. One of the female lead actually forms a rival organization to battle said student council. The catch? Besides the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>, most of the members of the Student Council are non-humans (referred to as NPCs, placeholders of human beings who are mostly completely apathetic and oblivious to whatever zaniness occurs near them). Also, since they are simply dedicated to preserving order (which the rival organization always try to subvert), they don't do much around the school.
</li><li> The student council in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AnimeGataris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AnimeGataris">Anime-Gataris</a></em> is shown to be always looking to take down the little anime club to the point they can on a whim order their disbandment or demand they prove their worth. Minoa at one time even regards their power to that of an anime <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">production comittee</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AsuraCryin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/AsuraCryin">Asura Cryin'</a></em>, the student council can give the authorization to kill. Can't get much more powerful than that.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Beelzebub">Beelzebub</a></em>, St. Ishiyama Academy has the Six Knights, who <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">use to</span> have absolute authority over the student body, even over the actual student council. At Ishiyama High, there is no "official" student council. Instead, the "council" is the Tohoshinki, the four strongest delinquents of the entire school. Oga later on became the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>" when he defeated all four, making him the strongest delinquent at Ishiyama High.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BestStudentCouncil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BestStudentCouncil">Best Student Council</a></em>: This is the premise of the show. The eponymous student council has military, law enforcement, and intelligence/ninja divisions, and is hand-picked by its president, Jinguuji Kanade, for reasons that she mostly keeps to herself. President Kanade believes in not restricting the freedom of the students, which limits the near-absolute control the council could otherwise exert.
<ul><li> Part of the island split to reveal a <em>missile silo</em> aimed at a <em>nuclear aircraft carrier</em> in <strong>episode two</strong> just because a guy on the carrier annoyed the president.
</li></ul></li><li> The one-shot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiGenre">yaoi</a> manga <em>Bondage</em> is about this. A male student constantly breaks the school rules about smoking and fighting and is... punished for it every time by the two (male) student council members.
</li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Charlotte">Charlotte</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Nao</a> mentions that the Hoshinoumi Academy student council has special privileges which allow them to skip classes and not get penalized for it, due to the fact that they often have to go off-campus to find people with special powers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ChromeShelledRegios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ChromeShelledRegios">Chrome Shelled Regios</a></em>: The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a> is explicitly in charge of the city. Considering that includes its military for fighting giant monsters as well as other cities, that's a pretty big responsibility. He can effectively force students to change their majors if he decides it's in the city's best interest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ClampSchoolDetectives" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ClampSchoolDetectives">Clamp School Detectives</a></em>: This series has absurdly powerful student councils for each grade division, leading to (say) the chairman of the Elementary Division Council (Nokoru) consulting with the chairlady of the Kindergarten Division Council (Utako) over plans for festivals that shut down all actual schoolwork through to the University level for weeks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>: Ashford Academy is owned by a former noble family that built the first <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, and the head's granddaughter is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>; this means that the average students are subject to her playful whims like Complete Silence Parties and the Crossdressing Festival. And this all is before we get into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolFestival">School Festival</a> where they use a decommissioned mecha to try and make the world's largest pizza.
</li><li> Remember that bit about how <em>vitally important</em> school clubs are in Japan? The Student Council in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove">Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!</a></em> manga shuts them down at seemingly random, and one of the plot threads deals with their ongoing efforts against the Earth Defense Club, which they loathe (the titular <em>Bouei-bu</em>). Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Kinshirou Kusatsu</a>, tears into anyone he even <em>suspects</em> of breaking rules. They also get hefty privileges - <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CustomUniform">Custom Uniforms</a>, a fancy office, even a fancy table of their own in the cafeteria. And did we mention they're also trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a>, and are the main opponents of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl">Magical Boys</a> in the Defense Club?
</li><li> Definitely the case of the high school on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DanceInTheVampireBund">Dance in the Vampire Bund</a></em> as Mina was the one who founded the school and takes it over. Much to the anger of the current student council president.
<ul><li> Also fairly well justified, as Mina founded the school with very controversial plans for it. This way, instead of having to deal with continual resistance from the student body, clubs and student council, parents, teachers, the school board, news services, and the general public, she only has to deal with a student council used to suppress all the other groups and which already consists of the strongest-minded and most politically active students. They'd have been manageable even without the way things turned out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DearBrother">Dear Brother</a></em> has the Sorority, a group of girls from rich and powerful families who are seen as the best of the best and have lots of privileges, alongside being adored by the students. The main conflict begins when a girl from a middle-class background, the protagonist Nanako Misonoo, is <em>somehow</em> chosen to be a member of it, eliciting the anger and envy of <em>many</em> others.
</li><li> The Elite Ten of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>, who make all the important decisions of Totsuki Culinary Academy and hold higher authority than the teachers. The Elite Ten are approached for consultations and advice by much of the culinary world and have access to recipe collections, ingredients and cooking equipment of near-immeasurable value. A seat on the Elite Ten is considered to be more valuable than a place at the school, meaning that those who wish to challenge the Elite Ten to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CookingDuel">Shokugeki</a> have to bet <em>more</em> than just expulsion.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket">Fruits Basket</a></em>: The council that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Yuki ends up becoming president of</span> doesn't seem to be especially powerful, though they seem to be a large part of the preparations for at least one school festival. Rather, the student council seems to be more of a gathering of most of the people least suited to be a part of the group. This is lampshaded several times by the author, usually by way of Kakeru, who continually views the council as some <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em>-esque superhero team and spreads word around the school that the council will do all sorts of things for events which they don't have the power to do (the last one causes Yuki no end of trouble, leading him to cheerfully strangle Kakeru while saying "So it was <em>you</em>, you bastard!").

(The hefty donations the school has received from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrivateMilitaryContractors">Mithril</a> have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">nothing to do with her decision</a>.)

<ul><li> In the finale, it is revealed that student council members are graduating from high school... only for the council president Anzu to be the chairman of Ooarai, implying that she wrestled power from the previous chairman who was implied to be financially corrupt.

Justified, as most of the senior faculty are devils, and direly outranked by the <em>de facto</em> heads of two of the three great houses. In fact, since both Rias and Souna have older siblings who are Satans, the balance of power for <em>the entire Devil faction</em> is filtered through Kuoh Academy's school politics.

He has the director of the local hospital under his fingers and is the most feared delinquent group in their town AND can get rid of dead bodies, no questions asked.
<ul><li> The reason for Hibari's considerable influence becomes clear by the Varia Arc — he is quite simply one of the deadliest people on the planet and resisting his will immediately puts one in severe physical danger.

As crazy as this sounds, this is actually more plausible than it seems considering the school is owned by the incredibly wealthy and powerful Kiryuin family, with daughter Satsuki at the head of the student council and her mother Ragyo willing to enable her daughter's project. The school is also a Life Fibers research and development facility that cranks out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClothesMakeTheSuperman">superpowered uniforms</a>, which they use to control the student body and the faculty. Satsuki herself is pretty open with how the school is run by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a> and is emulating a military.
<ul><li> The glimpses we see of other schools resisting Honnoujis imperialist ambitions suggests Satsuki is only slightly more powerful than the usual student council president. Her most dangerous rival, Kaneo Takarada of Naniwa Kinman High School, controls the local economy of Osaka with his familys personal scrip and bankrolls its citizens as reserves to his schools own student military. And thats not getting into his intelligence network of gossipy Osaka grannies, or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>.

<ul><li> The series takes the absurdity to new levels; the student council is not only more powerful than the faculty, but it's also more powerful than the <strong>government</strong>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidSama">Maid-Sama!</a></em>, the Seika student council isn't really all that different from any 'normal' anime student council, but the Miyabigaoka (insanely rich kid school very similar to Ouran but played straight) student council can prosecute other students from other schools for punching a chess club member.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em>: The student council essentially polices itself, with its actual headmaster being little more than a figurehead.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ManabiStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ManabiStraight">Manabi Straight!</a></em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">deconstruction</a> of this, about a group of girls <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture">20 Minutes into the Future</a> who are newly forming a Student Council. A theme of the series seems to be that kids aren't allowed to be kids anymore and the notion of an Absurdly Powerful Student Council takes itself far, far too seriously.
</li><li> Inverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medabots">Medabots</a></em> — the show's Student Council are stereotypical nerds who are hopeless at Medabot battling and lose their meeting room to the school bullies in the first episode.
</li><li> In the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>, the student council goes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> on the scale. Powerful, capable of defeating any number of delinquents without effort, trained in ridiculously high levels of martial arts, and seemingly impervious to any school authority for taking whatever actions are deemed necessary to carry out helping students with their requests. All the more amusing that in this case, the student council is <em>one girl</em>, the eponymous Medaka, whose standards are so high that after being elected <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StudentCouncilPresident">Student Council President</a>, she wears all the armbands of the entire student council herself to signify she's the only one capable of doing their jobs to her satisfaction (until she eventually gives one to her childhood best friend).
</li><li> The student council in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MidoriDays">Midori Days</a></em> spends several chapters hiring the most elite fighters of Japan in order to make the protagonist a fearless fighter again... so that he would become the class president the next year. Not only do the fights not work, but Seiji plain out doesn't care.
</li><li> The Fraternity of the Farm in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Moyashimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Moyashimon">Moyashimon</a></em> has some elements of this, especially in the live-action adaptation.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeartcatchPrettyCure">HeartCatch Pretty Cure!</a></em> also plays with this.

Erika doesn't give up so easily and she and Tsubomi confront Itsuki at her home... and find out Itsuki's a pretty nice guy... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Bifauxnen">er, girl.</a>

They are never seen to discuss uniforms or hall passes.
<ul><li> Actually, the treasurer of the Council, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefrostingIceQueen">Juri</a>, was briefly seen in one episode talking with a teacher about Student Council-y stuff. By the way, the teacher seemed <em>terrified</em> of her.
</li><li> In an odd pass, neither the school nor the Council itself ever thinks to hold "elections" for a new Vice-President and no one ever blinks for a second when Nanami declares herself President in her brother's place.
<ul><li> The Utena <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaSaturn">Sega Saturn</a> game pumps up the absurdity, by revealing that the only reason the council members have their places at all is that they're the most popular and "prince-like" students in the school. Their jobs on the council are arbitrarily assigned based on their age. Mikki is genuinely shocked at the revelation; Juri just gets pissed.

Henriette Mystere is not just the student council president, she's the <em>only</em> real authority figure at the school.

However, the student council says that a knight's honor is on the line anytime they do something like this, and allows this duel on the grounds of it being a training session. The only alternative is to quit the school, but Mio refuses that option since it wouldn't allow her to be close to Takahiro, a guy she likes, so she reluctantly agrees to the duel...

An important element in the story's first part is Miyamura, Odagiri and Tamaki's race to become the new student council president because the president has ultimate power over the school and no-one can refuse his orders. Other than the power the student council has on the school, they are even able to extend their power beyond the school - for example, they forbid anyone who is not a member of the council to visit Asuka's house, and Asuka's mother actually complies with it.

Because the <em>headteachers</em> are crazy enough to allow it, as the owner of both schools apparently finds it convenient. It's shown that at least the Supreme Five Swords know who is actually in charge, as the one time their headmistress decides to punish their president and another one they just take the punishment.

</li><li> The student council in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YandereSimulator">Yandere Simulator</a></em> combines this trope with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowSashOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YellowSashOfPower">Yellow Sash of Power</a>, as the student council, headed by the final rival, Megami Saikou, has the authority to stop and punish troublemakers by reporting them to the councilor or, in extreme cases, pepper spraying the perpetrator herself. Killing a student council member causes Megami to take more extreme security measures, such as metal detectors and security cameras, to catch evildoers. It will eventually be possible for Yandere-chan herself to join the student council, with the benefits of being able to ask favors of students without befriending them, be thirty minutes late to class without punishment, be able to go anywhere except the boys' bathroom without being considered a trespasser, not be so easily noticed when doing questionable actions, and one unknown benefit that only kicks in when Megami returns to school after her leave of absence. <em>Joining</em> the student council, however, requires a number of difficult requirements before they'd even consider it, and <em>staying</em> in the student council requires Yandere-chan to attend <em>daily</em> meetings and perform five tasks a week, which cuts into the time needed to eliminate rivals.
</li><li> The student council of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnsembleStars">Ensemble Stars!</a></em> has control over the different clubs, organisations, and groups the students can be part of.

This means that the council - and particularly its president, Eichi - have a <em>huge</em> amount of control over all the students' current careers and reputations, which may follow them for the rest of their lives. As it happens, before the player character transferred in, this power was <em>absolutely</em> abused to promote the president's group. However, over the course of the main story, a plucky group of second-years manage to reverse this and cut back most of this power. The student council remains an intimidating presence over the following stories, but not nearly to the same extent as before.

Whilst they don't, perhaps, reach the same extremes as some of the examples listed here, they're shown at least to have quite some actual power as regards to the running of the school. For example, one character joins the council in order to force the school to take action against the rampant sexual harassment going on (though in that character's case it was more her and her family threatening legal action than the position in the school council that got the school to act).

The Council also plays a major role in directing the townspeople's attention away various (extremely obvious) supernatural occurrences, including a mysterious "Glow Cloud" seen hovering around town and raining dead animals, a bloody massacre at the local post office which was accompanied with sounds of "souls being ripped apart by black magic", and the frequent sightings of mysterious figures in black robes lurking around town.

<ul><li> While student positions in High School or below are generally powerless, student positions at Colleges are often far more influential. For example, the student trustee of many institutions will often have a full vote that is fully equal to those of the other school trustees. Also, many schools have student-run boards set up to manage the portion of student fees used for student organizations. In large schools, this can easily lead to control of many thousands of dollars.
<ul><li> Most of the funds are either used for things like bringing in comedians, musicians, and films (to be enjoyed by students free of charge, since after all, they've already <em>paid</em> for them) or are given away to campus clubs. Frequently, if a club bothers to ask and the amount isn't ludicrous, it's essentially a rubber-stamp decision (all officially recognized clubs generally have representation on the council, and if your club's representative gets a reputation for turning down requests, guess what will happen to his own club's requests).

These guys are emulating the authority hierarchy that exists in the real military and helping the sergeants manage the sometimes upwards of <em>thousands</em> of airmen in any given training squadron. They are able to report airmen to the sergeants for violating rules and are often expected to take attendance and make sure everybody gets to where they are supposed to be. Some Ropes are apathetic as long as the airmen under them don't actively get them in trouble, others are regular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeidermeyer">Neidermeyers</a>, quite a few actually are competent leaders if given a chance.
<ul><li> Even this is a subversion. What the squadron leadership says is what goes. A Rope who tries to maintain otherwise does so at his or her own peril.
</li></ul></li><li> In many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryAcademy">Military Academies</a>, in order to prepare cadets for their future careers, the students are given ranks parallel to their equivalents within the real military. First-year students will often be cadet privates and fourth-year students will be cadet officers. The cadets will be organized into battalions and companies under the command of upper-class cadet officers. Many times these corps of cadets will be led by a "cadet colonel" or general. Actual commissioned officers have seniority over a cadet of any rank. Cadets <em>do</em> however outrank the enlisted personnel of the military in question.
<ul><li> The Honor Board that such institutions in the United States have conducts investigations into allegations of honor code violations (could be anything from cheating on a test to faking illness in order to avoid guard duty to knowing about an honor code violation and not reporting it). Typically, the Honor Board functions in the same manner as a court-martial, with one Honor Board member serving as defense. If the cadets who are on the Honor Board find a cadet guilty of a violation of the honor code (typically something along the lines of "A cadet will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor tolerate those who do."), a punishment gets recommended to the commandant (at least for upperclassmen, it's usually dismissal), who has the final say over it but rarely reduces the punishment.
<ul><li> The Virginia Military Institute has a "single-sanction" honor system, meaning that all violators of the honor code are dismissed. In fact, they are immediately led off of the premises after they are convicted, told that if they ever returned, the police would be called, and asked for an address in Lexington (the town where the Institute is located) for their possessions to be delivered to or an address somewhere else for their possessions to be shipped to along with a bill for the shipping. After that, in the middle of the night, the Corps of Cadets is woken up via a drum roll and told <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnPerson">never to speak the name of the violator in the barracks again</a>.

In one of their newsletters, "world domination" is implied to be their ultimate goal.
</li><li> At <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Student_Government">the University of Colorado at Boulder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the student government handles a budget around $36.6 million dollars. It's been autonomous from Colorado's government since 1974. It has three branches of government and visits Washington, D.C. regularly to weigh in on decisions involving students in the United States. Officially, there are only a few students in each branch of government, but there are hundreds of students involved with some sort of student government at CU-Boulder. Absurdly powerful doesn't even start to describe it. Oh, and this isn't even mentioning the enormous collection of clubs, including the represented racial groups, foreign countries, and the huge GLBT and Gay Straight Alliance!
<ul><li> A lot of public universities have versions of this. A portion of student fees go the student government and are under student control. Also, typically the student center and school stores are owned by and managed by this (and as anyone who has ever bought a college textbook can tell you, this can be lucrative). Budgets in the tens of millions are quite common, as are trips to the state capitol and other places (as are the occasional reports of malfeasance) the amount the student body is aware and or cares of these activities varies.

<div class="indent"><em>With elections approaching, student candidates in Lucknow, for example openly supported by national and regional political parties, extorted money and vehicles from businessmen, plastered the city with posters and subjected it to their violent and clamorous will. After elections, elected leaders extorted contracts from the university, particularly the works department, forced entry into all-important university decisions and exacted protection money from government contractors. They also sported the latest cars, had their own gunmen and strode the university overawing and coercing college principals and university vice-chancellors to do their bidding. They did not stop at university authorities, but extorted money and goods from local merchants, ostensibly to fund student activities.</em>
</div></li></ul><div class="indent">The report also wryly added student elections around India are violent or banned because of violence.
</div><ul><li> Some British secondary schools have adopted a system in which the student council comprises of specially-selected sixth form students who make decisions on behalf of the entire sixth form. The staff is consulted and the school governors have some say, but the power split is aimed to be roughly 70/30.
</li><li> Frosh Week at the University of Waterloo is run by the Education Committee or EDCOM. They dress and act like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">military police</a>, but their authority only lasts for the duration of Frosh Week, and they are usually very friendly outside of uniform.
<ul><li> On the other hand, the University of Waterloo (Ontario)'s Federation of Students has a large budget and is run like a corporation, including high salaries for its executives.
</li></ul></li><li> The University of Bologna was originally <em>run</em> by the student council, who hired, fired, and set the wages of all the professors. A student committee was also charged with keeping tabs on the professors for any misbehavior. The professors could be fined if they failed to finish classes on time or complete their course material by the end of the semester (the professors weren't powerless, though, forming into a College of Teachers to win the rights to set exam fees and degree requirements). Even so, a reverse from the usual relationship (unsurprisingly, as the university was founded by the <em>students</em> c. 1088, making it the oldest known in the world). Eventually, its rule was ended by the city authorities, who turned it into a regular public university.
</li><li> In Victorian Era boarding schools, the "fagging" system gave the senior students almost complete power over their juniors. Under the system, a junior student (the fag) was assigned to act as a servant to an upper-year student (the fagmaster); in return, the upper-year student was held responsible for his charge's welfare and behaviour; furthermore, he was asked mentor and protect him. The entire system, in turn, was overseen by a group of prefects lead by the Head Boy/Girl, all students. Because adult teachers generally did not concern themselves with the students outside of class except in the most extreme of circumstances, these elder students had almost complete authority over the people under them in terms of settling disputes and administering punishments. Many of these people abused their authority and basically treated their charges as slaves and playthings. The entire system was intentionally created to prepare their students for the harsh and regimented life in the army and colonial service.
</li><li> At Danish universities, the students get to elect members of the University Board; members of the Academic Council, who advices the dean and hands out (Or denies, if need be) all academic titles such as Ph.D.'s, Professorates and Doctorates; and members of the Study Board, which decides on all matters related to education at the particular department. While the students are a minority in both the Board and the Council, they have an equal vote with the academic staff at the Study Boards (Usually 4 representatives each), leading to this trope being somewhat justified. Further, since all these elections are usually won by the Students Councils, the Councils themselves do wield considerable power.
