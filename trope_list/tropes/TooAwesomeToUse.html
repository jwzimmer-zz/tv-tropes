</p><p>It is also single-use and impossibly scarce.
</p><p>...Yup, it's going to end up sitting safe and sound in your inventory until the very end.
</p><p>Games such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPG">RPGs</a> featuring an inventory system are prone to giving you items that are Too Awesome to Use. It could be an item that heals all your stats and makes you invulnerable for an extended period of time. It could be a special power that lets you fly, or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusBuff">Status Buff</a> that lets you destroy the universe with the snap of a finger. It could be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">Superweapon</a> with an extremely limited amount of ammo, or an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">ultimate sword</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakableWeapons">breaks after a certain number of uses</a>.
</p><p>It's useful, awesome, and practical — unfortunately, you're never going to use the item outside of maybe the last boss (as you wouldn't need it afterwards), either because you're afraid to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonUnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonUnique">waste such a valuable treasure</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectSolutionFallacy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectSolutionFallacy">will be waiting for that one good opportunity to use it</a>... and that opportunity never comes, or maybe because it simply pains you to imagine having it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HundredPercentCompletion">missing from your inventory</a>. This goes double if you never know what and how many unexpected and arbitrary-difficulty challenges the game might throw at you any next moment (and jRPGs <em>love</em> doing that), so you feel compelled to always hold to a failsafe or multiple just in case.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0lurx');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0lurx" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0lurx');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Which is critical if the game features sections without an ability to backtrack — even if death is not final, if you're unable to beat the next challenge, you've effectively lost the game permanently, and all the time spent on it is wasted.</span> Another factor that contributes has to do with balancing the game. If you make a super powerful super rare healing potion, it'll be most useful in a similarly difficult battle but what if the player used the potion already? Do you make that fight easy enough that it's winnable without the potion (thus the optimal option is to fight without it because you didn't actually need it) or make it so difficult it's heavily recommended to use the potion (thus a player that did waste the potion hits a brick wall)? Of course you may save it until the last boss only to realize <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContractualBossImmunity">you can't use it during boss fights</a>...

In any case, the item may just become useful in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> if one exists in the game.
</p><p>Consequently, if there's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">item duplication</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">glitch</a> in the game or some game mechanic that lets you obtain a spare or two, then of course you're going to be using it all the time.

<ul><li> A flamethrower is located in a hidden alcove. Despite being the strongest weapon in the game, the flamethrower is unique, only has 400 ammo and is best saved for the final boss.

This isn't because ammo is scarce (quite the contrary), it's because the thing is simply too valuable for blasting open doors and cracked walls.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfTanks">World of Tanks</a></em> is a multiplayer arcade tank arena combat game that features optional consumables, such as first aid kits, repair kits, and fire extinguishers. In previous builds of the game, such items were single-use consumables that could only be spent once per match. However, this meant that you could, for instance, expend your pricey deluxe repair kit to bring your destroyed tracks back into action and escape destruction, only to have your ammo rack knocked out two minutes later, crippling your damage-dealing ability for the rest of the match. Thus, players often held on to such consumables for far too long, resulting in otherwise survivable situations being lost because players were refusing to use their items in case they would need it later. Thankfully, Wargaming realized that this was leading to an extremely gun-shy, passive playerbase, and decided to allow consumables to work on a cooldown; now, expending a consumable activates a 90-scond cooldown timer, which is usually enough to justify the item's use presently with the potential for 'later' use if needed.
</li><li> Wargaming elected to go this route with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarships">World of Warships</a></em> by default, tweaking it slightly such that while module repair was always available (on a cooldown), non-module-repair consumables were an option that could be spent a limited number of times per match for some temporary advantage, such as smokescreen concealment or search radars.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>:
<ul><li> Elixir Soup refills all your magic and life AND doubles your attack power until you take damage (the only item in the game to do so), and you can do this twice with one bottle since she gives you two servings. Since getting a refill requires going all the way back to your house, an unpleasant task if you're in the middle of a dungeon, and since the game is relatively easy in the first place, you might opt to search for hearts and potions in grass and pots rather than using it, and you might beat the whole game without using it. (But you'll keep one with you anyway, since they're the best thing to have in your bottle.)
</li><li> The Fill-Up Coupon for Beedle's Ship Shop. It automatically refills all ammo-dependent items in your inventory, but you only get one... Because the game is obligated to give you ammo in areas where you need them, and because the game almost always prioritizes ammo when you're not already full, you'll always feel more justified in just scavenging some ammo, rather than using the coupon. Because the coupon can also only be redeemed at one of the Ship Shops, <em>even if you were completely empty on all arrows, bombs, and running low on hearts</em>, there's still no reason to go out of your way to find Beedle just to use said coupon.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></em>, you are rewarded with a bottle of Fairy Tears for collecting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyBearAsses">20 Poe Souls</a>. These not only refill Link's health completely, but they increase his attack power temporarily as well (unfortunately, only for 10 seconds at best). However, in order to get more than just the one, you have to take Link on a quest through the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Cave of Ordeals</a>". But again, they are refillable and free afterwards, and beating the entire Cave lets you refill on Fairy Tears in 5 different areas in Hyrule. Rare Chu Jelly does the same thing, but good luck getting them in a crush of ChuChu or finding where they spawn.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em>, you can buy a certain potion that makes you take half damage for a while. You can also upgrade it to make you invulnerable instead. The period during which the potion lasts is rather long, and unlike the attack-boosting soup/potions from <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> it is not canceled after being hit once. Once you get a certain other item, the potion duration is further increased. So you got an item that makes you invincible for a few <em>minutes</em>? Nope, won't use it despite its power, maybe because it ironically enough it's <em>too good</em> and feels a bit cheap.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game's durability system and lack of a way to properly repair weapons (excluding the Champions' weapons) makes this so. The player never wants to use powerful weapons on weak enemies (or even on powerful ones) because you want to save it for harder enemies, and it will inevitably break. Even the shields and bows break after use, meaning that oftentimes, players will forego combat entirely unless hunting for ingredients to upgrade clothing to avoid damaging their weapons. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVseQ3RDa6s">Jim Sterling even references the trope by name in a video discussing his dislikes about said system.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Ironically, this results the aforesaid Champions' arms - the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProngsOfPoseidon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProngsOfPoseidon">Lightscale Trident</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multishot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Multishot">Great Eagle Bow</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">Boulder Breaker</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuckilyMyShieldWillProtectMe">Daybreaker</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSword">Scimitar of the Seven</a> - averting the trope: despite being powerful, the ease of re-obtaining them makes them the <em>most</em> likely to be used.
</li><li> Certain ingredients such as Star Fragments and dragon pieces, which have inconvenient farming methods. The former drop rarely, at random, and players have to be paying attention to the falling star trail and go through tracking it down. For the latter, the dragons have set spawning areas and "paths" that they fly through, but they only spawn at fixed times of the day, the player has to make it to their location before they leave through their portal, and only one piece of them can be collected per day. These ingredients allow for some of the highest armor upgrades in the game, <em>or</em> the latter can be used to create recipes with status buff effects that last half an hour. With that in mind, it's entirely possible to have a small collection of dragon parts just sitting in a player's inventory without making the firm choice on just what to use them on.
</li><li> Half-hour food boosts themselves, which come from cooking with dragon horns or a rare result of using Monster Extract. Thirty whole minutes with boosted attack or speed would be extremely useful, except there are few single quests that would take the player <em>that</em> long, and only one food buff may be active at a time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveScumming">Save Scumming</a> can be used with the latter to always get the full thirty minutes.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Lightning in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medievil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Medievil">Medievil</a></em> is the most powerful weapon in the game, but you have no way to recharge it if you run out. Most players never bother actually using it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a></em> has any number of powerful, one-shot items that most players will hang onto "until the right time". But as the game is relatively easy compared to later <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania-style</a> games (and possesses what many consider the easiest Dracula fight in the series), that time will never come. On the second or later playthrough of the game, it is possible to obtain an item called the Duplicator, making those single-use items infinitely reusable; still, it's easy to see why many of them became equippable (and thus infinite-use) subweapons in later games.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em>:
<ul><li> Thanks to there being almost no hint of when it might be safe to use them, and being generally placed in arbitrary positions, the rarer-than-golddust <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaveGameLimits">save crystals</a> in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> version of the 3rd game ended up suffering from this for a lot of people. Previous games encouraged/forced players to manage their inventory by striking a balance between using medi-kits and using ammunition for the better weapons when confronting dangerous enemies. The crystals created a third thing to manage, and the more obsessive-compulsive players could find this pretty stressful.

The community has, however, puzzled out an optimal method of spending the bonus Mist and the original starting 100 that will leave a new player economically competitive without having to go through the traditional starting grind.

However, they're very expensive to make or buy (one key ingredient isn't available outside of an obscenely rare drop from an uncommon enemy until late in the game, and they can't be bought until they've been made for the first time), and each craft/purchase only makes 9 bullets (outside of late-game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> tricks). Plus, using guns can be a bit finicky if the player isn't used to how they work in the game.

For new players it is easy to fall into the trap of not using it because "it's not too late, I can still survive this combo and make a comeba—wait, what do you mean I lost?!" A good player has to learn when to bite the bullet and use Barrier Burst effectively.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazBlueContinuumShift">BlazBlue: Continuum Shift</a></em> and its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Updated Rereleases</a> <em>Continuum Shift II</em> and <em>Continuum Shift EXTEND</em> continue this line but separates the Barrier Burst into two different versions (and is also renamed to Break Burst). Additionally, everyone starts with one Break Burst and gains the second one once losing the round. The Break Burst (or at least the original one) will also halve "Guard Primers" needed to block guard-breaking attacks as well. Then we have the "Gold" Burst which can only be performed if the character is not being attacked and will launch the opponent high in the air and allow for follow-up combos.

Using it also uses up the Burst Meter and forces the player to decide if they want to go on the offensive and use the Overdrive for possible better offensive capabilities or to Burst and break out of any combos the opponent tries.

The "I can handle these with smaller weapons" effect comes to play, even though in 75% of fights against big groups, you can actually <em>conserve</em> ammo by using the BFG. <em>Doom 3</em>'s version of the BFG uses its own unique ammo type, which should make it more viable to use but instead makes it feel even <em>more</em> restrictive despite the game giving plenty of BFG cells from that point on.

It doesn't help that the MP5 and Combine Pulse Rifle work in mid range, the shotgun does close-range, and the crossbow does percision long range shots. Everything the Magnum could do is done by something else that gets more ammo with less headaches.

Bile bombs can draw zombies away or even turn them on each other for a long duration, making them valuable during hordes, while adrenaline shots are the only thing in the game that give a speed boost and negate both fatigue and the zombies' slow-down attack. You can only carry one at a time, and it also means you cannot carry other kinds of bombs or pills (which are much more abundant). Thankfully, the areas where you must use these items are usually very obvious, but in certain maps (such as The Parish) where these locations are at the very end of the map, you're stuck holding onto them for several areas and unable to switch out.

<ul><li> The GEP gun is offered as an option to the player at the start of the game. Good enough to take out most bots with one rocket, it takes up a giant 8 out of 30 inventory slots, and ammo for it is relatively rare.
</li><li> HE ammo for the Assault rifle later on in the game is partially susceptible to this, as while it offers Heavy Weapon power for a Rifle specialist, ammunition is fairly rare.
</li><li> The Light Anti-tank Weapon is a one-shot rocket launcher that is guaranteed to destroy <em>anything</em> it hits directly, and also probably anything standing nearby. However, because it's only a one-shot gun and takes up four inventory spaces, it's impractical to carry around if you have other rifles or heavy weapons with you. Cue desperate thinking about how best to dispose of it along with some Inventory Tetris. On the bright side, the LAW was almost always found near giant military robots, so if you could spare the space for it you'd certainly have a use for it.
</li><li> LAMs (grenades that can be attached to flat surfaces and then double as promixity mines) are extremely useful for blowing up doors and other barriers or for setting deadly ambushes. However, they are relatively rare, if not as much as some other items. You can use other, easier-to-find explosives like the GEP Gun to reduce the need even more. This can lead to sudden moments of anger when you already have the maximum of 10 LAMs in the inventory and come upon a new one in the field. There actually IS a point in the game where having loaded up on LAMs pays off, though. At a later point, they also pretend you'll need at least 5 of them for a mission (with a character charging you thousands of credits to buy some) but actually, any explosive will work. So in the end, outside that one scene, you'll probably still only use them to lay impressive ambush grids, lure your enemies into that, enjoy the show, then load a savegame and get past the obstacle without wasting LAMs instead.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeusExHumanRevolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a></em> you have multiple contenders for this, and frequently spend Praxis Points upgrading your inventory to keep it all in there.
<ul><li> The Heavy Rifle earlier in the game, which is almost useless without error-correcting augs, and later on the laser rifle or grenade launcher. Masses of space, no ammunition for the latter two, and completely unnecessary when you can headshot everyone with a silenced/laserguided pistol.
</li><li> Those who pre-ordered or bought the applicable DLC pack will experience this through the grenade launcher; it can only be acquired about 2/3 into the plot and eats through boss health, but all ammo for it (save for the six grenades it comes loaded with) must be found, which means most players get little use out of it.
</li></ul></li><li> The Diamond tiles from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bookworm">Bookworm</a></em> are just worth <em>so</em> many points, that using them in almost any situation feels like a waste.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsAkimbo">dual shotguns</a> of the latter two installments of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Marathon">Marathon</a></em> trilogy, which would use up even a maxed-out load of ammo in a matter of seconds (and one ammo pickup contains only 2 shells, same amount you use up for one shot from single shotgun). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">And reduce anything in the game to a bloody pulp even faster.</a>
<ul><li> The flechette gun from the third game also qualifies. Is more powerful than the assault rifle and way more accurate, it works in vacuum and it's only weapon (apart from fists) working underwater. Unfortunately it burns through magazines faster than any other weapon (and you can hold only 8 reloads) and ammo pickups are quite rare.
</li></ul></li><li> The Earthshaker missiles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Descent">Descent</a> II</em>. You'll need most of them for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wolfenstein2009">Wolfenstein (2009)</a></em> the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidJetpackHitler">powerful experimental weapons</a> you acquire early will have very little ammo available for scrounging until the weapons themselves become plentiful in the hands of the enemy. On the other hand, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ghostapo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ghostapo">Thule Medallion</a> that gives you mystical powers appears even earlier, and energy refills are literally everywhere. Of course, the Medallion is an integral part of the game and story and you <em>need</em> to use it no matter what.
</li><li> The Browning Automatic Rifle in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedalOfHonor">Medal of Honor</a></em> games packs a punch and has great accuracy at long range, but has very limited ammo (practically no pickups). You can get by with an SMG in most situations.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDuty">Call of Duty</a></em> has the BAR fall into the exact same situation for the exact same reason. It's accurate and it's powerful, but you only get it in one level, and the ammo you start out with for it is all you get - there's no pickups in the level and none of your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirt">exchangeable, replaceable allies</a> use it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuakeII">Quake II</a></em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuadDamage">Quad Damage</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibilityPowerup">Invulnerability</a>, items that give the player an enormous upper hand for <em>half a minute</em>. The problem is that they are inventory items, meaning you can activate them whenever you want to use them. However, they're so powerful and you fight off so few enemies at once in the levels, you'll keep the things in reserve throughout the game until the final boss. When used together, they turn it into a joke. It doesn't help that the game pretty much throws Quad Damages at you, making you feel kinda guilty for hoarding the two little Quads you found in the first hub throughout the whole game.
</li><li> The Devastator from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukem3D">Duke Nukem 3D</a></em> is a full-auto, double-barrel rocket launcher that's tiny explosions do as much damage as a single RPG round and can clear out a whole room full of baddies in seconds, but it burns through its ammo supply very quickly and replacement rockets are fairly rare, so most players just hang onto The Devastator until it's time to fight the given episode's boss, which will go down in about 5-10 seconds of sustained fire from it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a></em>'s "I win" weapon is the Serious Bomb, which kills every enemy in an area, no matter how much health they have and it can be activated by merely pressing a button. Because of how powerful and handy it is, you'll usually be keeping it in reserve "in case" throughout the game. <em>Serious Sam 2</em> and <em>Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter</em> make this even worse because you have to take it out as a regular weapon before using it, meaning that even if you do want to use it, you'll have to determine if you have enough time or space to take the thing out and use it without being mauled, and by that time you've probably managed to thin out the horde enough so that you don't need the Serious Bomb anymore. On the plus side, Serious Bombs are the only weapon other than the knife and revolver that aren't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">taken away at the end of a chapter.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Borderlands2">Borderlands 2</a></em> has the Golden Keys which unlock the golden chest in Sanctuary. Said chest can dispense items of a purple rarity, but because their stats are based on the current level of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a>, they can effectively be obsolete after a while, so some players would tend to save their keys for a high-level character. The keys can only be obtained through preordering the game, purchasing the Mechromancer pack and through codes being periodically distributed on Gearbox's Twitter and Facebook.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BorderlandsThePreSequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel!</a></em> also has golden keys (which have all the perks and drawbacks of the above) but also has a legendary gun, the Excalibastard. This gun is available as a pickup in Stanton's Liver, an area you can get access to roughly 1/8th of the way into the game. The gun as incredible stats for another gun of a similar build and has the special ability of instantly freezing anyone you get a critical hit on and causing them to explode in an ice nova if you melee them to death. The only catch to it is that you can only pick it up once <em>per character</em>. Once you pick it up, it instantly scales to your level. This means that picking it up early would be a huge boon due to being able to wipe the floor with enemies, but the gun will be quickly outclassed. Pick it up later and closer to the max level and you'll probably not have to worry about it being outclassed, but you would have spent nearly the entire game without it.

<ul><li> The Apocalypse Weekend DLC has the Nuclear Launcher, which some might only use on the final boss since its ammo only shows up in one place (unless you use cheats).
</li><li> <em>Paradise Lost</em> has another of its own in the Revolver. More accurate and far more powerful than the default pistol, or even the assault rifle, and has a secondary fire mode that can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> pretty much any enemy in the game. It's also extremely rare, with only two pickups at the start of the game and only one or two more being added per day, and on top of that the secondary fire requires you to build up a meter by making kills with regular shots first. On top of that, there are some enemies, including most bosses, who are immune to the secondary fire. It isn't until the penultimate day of the game when its ammo becomes available for purchase.

Late in the game, there are lots of Nod structures to destroy and Master Control Terminals are ammo sponges if you try to destroy them without C4. The kicker is that the early game <em>swamps</em> Havoc with C4 pickups, but from the middle point and on, they're at more of a premium than half of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFGs</a>. If you don't want to have a long, tedious and frustrating time in the last two levels, save those puppies as soon as you go through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfSpilling">Bag of Spilling</a> mission.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheWoolBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheWoolBall">Shadow of the Wool Ball</a></em>: The Golden Shotgun is the most powerful weapon in the game, but its corresponding ammunition is scarce and most of it is hidden in secret areas, so you'll probably hold off using it on non-boss enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PAYDAYTheHeist">PAYDAY: The Heist</a></em> has doctor bags, which fully restores your health and resets the amount of incapacitations you received. Because a doctor bag has limited supplies, players commonly wait until they are on their last knockdown before healing. <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VidoeGame/PAYDAY2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VidoeGame/PAYDAY2">PAYDAY 2</a></em> has the same restrictions, but they are eased with the first aid kits which give a full heal while not resetting the knockdown counter. Some levels will have items that act as doctor bags and you can also purchase a basic doctor bag spawn in every level in addition to bringing your own.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations">Galactic Civilizations</a> 2</em>, it is possible to "get lucky" and find a rare Precursor battleship early on which is generally much stronger than anything currently out there. However, between fleet limits (a player at that point can generally only afford to field <em>only</em> that ship in a given battle) and a rather adaptive A.I., those ships may be held in reserve until they get surpassed by normal researched ships. Ironically, though, with the proper civilization traits, one can end up finding quite the number of such ships very early on.
</li><li> In 4X game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpaceEmpires">Space Empires</a> V</em> there is a special Ancient Ruins tech you may find if you colonise a planet, called Shield Imploder. It will bring down the enemy shields and cause damage to the enemy ship (Best description is the Breen weapon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em>), however it is rather weak at first, but eventually it will destroy with one shot ships relying on shields. So you end up keeping it secret so as not to let other players know you have it. A game can actually end before you get to the stage where it is a one shot kill weapon. Meanwhile it would have been quite good as it is to instantly remove enemy shields if you hadn't wanted to keep it a secret for later.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/X">X3: Terran Conflict</a></em>, you acquire the Xperimental Shuttle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XBeyondTheFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XBeyondTheFrontier">X: Beyond the Frontier</a></em> at the end of a plot chain. It's the second fastest M3 and has 200 MJ of shielding. It's also one of two ships that can never be reverse-engineered (barring mods or cheating). You'll either tuck it someplace safe and never touch it, or use it very sparingly as a personal yacht.
</li><li> The console-only (later ported to iOS) game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization Revolution</a></em> gives you an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NukeEm">ICBM</a> once you build the Manhattan Project wonder. Unlike a typical <em>Civilization</em> nuke, this one can reach any city and wipe it off the face of the map without leaving any fallout. However, it's a unique unit that you only get <em>once</em> per game. You probably will end up not using it until the game ends.

You can even build one as early as the mid-game, but odds are you won't ever use it. Why? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsUnforgivable">If you fire one, then you're expelled from the Planetary Council</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisMeansWar">you will be in a permanent state of war with all the other factions.</a> In addition, a Planet Buster will cause <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasLament" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasLament">massive ecological damage</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GaiasVengeance">so the native Mind Worms will go bugnuts on you too.</a>

It takes maybe an hour or two of killing enemies to fill it up all the way, and once you activate it, you have about 10 seconds of mauling everything within 20 feet of you before it's gone. It can't be turned off if you activate it by accident either. From Rage of the Titans in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarII">the sequel</a> on, there are orbs you can collect to refill the meter, and it can be turned off while active, averting this for the most part.

Moreover, you can't turn it off once you turn it on (a lesson <em>God of War</em> learned <em>years</em> ago), and you can only use it once you completely fill at least one tier on the potentially three-tier meter. If playing on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarderThanHard">Infernal difficulty</a>, you will use your Redemption <em>twice</em> over the course of the game, and both times are against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">incredibly cheap bosses</a>.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em> has a lot of items like this, though Blizzard eventually changed them to be unreliable or useless against enemies over a certain level. Fortunately, many of them can still be sold to players that have less doubts about using them in a tight situation.
<ul><li> The Holy Mightstone, an artifact that a level 50 paladin receives at the completion of a lengthy quest chain. It provides a 10-minute buff to damage vs. undead when used, but it can only be used once and can <em>never</em> be replaced since it's a quest item, so the end result is that most paladins end up never using it. Sadly it's fallen victim to power growth in expansions. At level 60 it would turn you into an death-machine by practically <strong>doubling</strong> your offensive stats. At level 80 - not so much. It gives the same boost, but by now it's a 5-10% power-up at most.
</li><li> Super Sticky Glue is an item you get from a quest in the Orc starting zone that allows you to immobilize the target. People always hang onto them in case they would ever really need one.
</li><li> A similar case with the unique "Light of Elune" potion (which grants full invulnerability for 10 sec and then it's gone forever). You get it as a mid-20s quest reward; people <em>still</em> have it in their lvl 70 character's inventory.
</li><li> A <em>lot</em> of the abilities with cooldowns over 5 minutes are seldom used except in times of utter desperation, waiting for that right moment... and sometimes in a dungeon or battleground run, never used at all. e.g. "Lay on Hands" (paladin) or "Recklessness" (warrior). Acknowledging this trope, Blizzard changed many of these skills to be somewhat less awesome, but with more manageable cooldowns, generally with the thought in mind that they should be available for every fight exactly once. Especially notable would be Shield Wall, a survival cooldown for warriors that used to have a 30 minute cooldown and make the user nearly invincible for its duration. Now it can be used every few minutes and still provides a significant damage reduction. Few abilities still exceed 10 minutes cooldown at this point, and many of those can be reduced significantly by talents.
</li><li> Flasks used to be like this in the original game. While they provided outlandish buffs (such as increasing player health by 1200, which for most classes meant a 30% increase in HP - an incredible amount, particularly for boss fights), they were also notoriously difficult to craft. Obviously, you needed to be a high-level alchemist (which in itself wasn't that big of a deal — many players would grind alchemy as it provided access to expendable mana and health potions). However, crafting flasks also required Black Lotus, a <em>ludicrously</em> rare herb (initially at any time there were a maximum of <em>four</em> in the entire game, up to one in each of the zones they could spawn) that <em>wasn't tradeable</em>: you had to find it <em>yourself</em> (good luck!) and in order to be able to gather it, you had to be a maxed-out herbalist. Since herbalism was considered a primary profession (of which you could only have two), if you chose any combination of professions other than "herba-alchy", you could not make flasks, period. To top off the ignominy, flasks could only be made in <em>one place in the entire world</em> (later two), which was smack at the end of a high-level dungeon. When C'Thun was first killed, most of the player community had problems wrapping their minds around the fact that the victorious guild expended <strong>forty</strong> flasks on this single boss fight.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CityOfHeroes">City of Heroes</a></em>:
<ul><li> There are several temp powers with a limited amount of use, many of which are earned for or after a specific mission and will never be retrievable again. Not surprisingly, these usually get hoarded for emergencies, and are still waiting to be used when your own powers are so far beyond them that there's no point any more. In some cases they don't make any sense using even when you do get them, a classic example being the Loa Bone, which lets you summon a zombie. Cool for most people, utterly redundant if you are a Mastermind who can already summon zombies. <br/><br/>Some of these temp powers became so popular that when the developers added Veteran Rewards, a shiny badge for every so many months the player has been subscribed plus an item like a special costume item or a free character rebuild, two of the rewards each gave a choice of two temp powers that would become permanent on that character. The player can make different choices of which powers to take on every character they have. The Sands of Mu and the Nemesis Staff are the two most popular choices.
</li><li> The Wedding Band hero-side springs first to mind. It granted a hefty resistance buff to all damage that lasted for two total hours of on-time (and maybe required an hour to get). Since it was only available to heroes, it quickly became the major target of villains and a fair issue of player-versus-player balance. The "Echo" version of the power now gives the same level of protection, but only lasts five minutes of on time, but can be stacked with the original version.
</li><li> Similarly, there's the Inspirations you build up as you play, basically the equivalent of potions in other MMORPGs that can be used at any time to heal health, restore endurance, or give a number of beneficial buffs. The thing is, you rarely need to use them to win most fights so the tray quickly fills up with Inspirations you hang on to for tougher fights and emergencies that never come.
</li><li> Many of the high-level powers take so long to recharge you can't use them in 99% of the fights. For example, an area-of-effect attack that lowers the defence, damage resistance and health regeneration of all enemies caught in the blast? Awesome. Too bad it has a several-minute recharge, and at the higher levels you tend to breeze through foes anyway, so the effect would barely be noticeable. Later on, many of the new sets had their "Tier 9" power not as Totally awesome, but usable much more often.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>: Many, many one-use items, especially the ones that were available for a limited time in the past and most likely will never become available again.
<ul><li> Many of the semi-rares fall prey to this trope. This may be later averted when diving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Fernswarthy's Basement</a>, where every little bit of stockpiled resistance and HP buff becomes more and more necessary. The items you receive as rewards while diving Fernswarthy's do qualify, though.
</li><li> Frosty's Iceball is an interesting variation. It does a large amount of elemental damage, even if you're low-level, and it isn't lost when used...the first two times. If you use it three times in one day, it vanishes. Getting it back is possible, but difficult, since it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">20%-chance-drop</a> from a certain boss in a multiplayer dungeon. The risk of accidentally destroying it by using it one too many times is a pretty strong deterrent against using it at all.
</li></ul></li><li> (Literal) Easter Eggs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NexusWar">Nexus War</a></em>, because they can only be found once a year, at Easter, and have variable effects which can't be determined before use. Later versions did this with Valentine's Day gifts as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/GaiaOnline">zOMG!</a></em> has the power-ups (Superchargers to restore partial health &amp; stamina, and Ring Polishers to temporarily increase the strength of your rings). Players get a couple of these from early quests in order to try them out. You can buy more, but the cost is in Gaia Cash, which requires spending real money (as opposed to Gaia Gold, which you can earn in at least a hundred different ways). Therefore, the power-ups earned as quest rewards can become Too Awesome to Use. Recent updates have attempted to mitigate this: power-ups are now rare loot drops, and power-ups bought from the store can be resold on the site's marketplace, which uses Gaia Gold as its currency.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVEOnline">EVE Online</a></em> has several extremely limited-run ships that were/are only handed out as a result of one-time events, such as the Alliance Tournaments. Since being able to say that you destroyed one of the five, say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolShip">Imperial Issue Apocalypses</a> in existence is cause for immense bragging rights, the result is that these ships sit in their owners' hangars, never actually being flown.
</li><li> The original release of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverQuest">EverQuest</a></em> had "The Aegis of Life" — a (then) high-end shield for clerics that required an extended camp.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2ntwv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2ntwv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2ntwv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Two rare spawns on a 4-hour timer, and had to be of two different versions of the same rare monster. Doing the required camp usually took 3-4 <em>real-time days</em> with around-the-clock vigilance to complete.</span> The shield had immense (for the era) AC, but also had a single expendable charge of "Complete Heal" built into it. The perfect way to heal a tank in a dire raid emergency. And nobody ever, ever, ever used it, because clerics had "Complete Heal" as a regular spell anyway, and there's always another raid....
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Tiger Shark, one of the most powerful pieces of food in the game. It heals more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> than any other fish<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note39bnc');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note39bnc" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note39bnc');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Except the Baron Shark (also very rare), which heals slightly more, but with a delay,</span> and it can even boost your life above its normal maximum. Of course, it can only be obtained with a near-maxed fishing level, requires a near-maxed cooking level to be edible, can't be traded with other players, and it's very rare, obtainable only through the Fishing Trawler minigame at an average catch rate of roughly one tiger shark for every <em>hour</em> of trawling.
</li><li> The Ancient Warriors' equipment used to be this. While chaotic weaponry and Nex armour surpass or at least rival them, Ancient Warriors' equipment has been around much longer. Ironically, the armour regained some popularity when they are given high damage soaking, as while they degrade into dust very quickly, individually they are cheaper than Nex armour and is less of a loss in high stakes PvP.
</li><li> In the "Sizzling Summer" promotion, players who had membership during a certain time period could redeem their fate cards for up to four extremely useful items, particularly the instant-kill darts, which could only be used on NPCs. The special items were removed from the game in the beginning of 2013.
<ul><li> Since then there have been more events where the Deathtouched dart can be obtained, and in 2018 a new store was added that sometimes sells them for 5 million coins each.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXI">Final Fantasy XI</a></em> is absolutely the king of this trope. Most items are extremely painful to get in this game and many of them are single-time use only. Many of the items below were extremely powerful when they were made available; their use has diminished somewhat since the level cap raise.
<ul><li> Phantom Tathlum — mediocre one-time use multi-class throwing weapon that is dropped by a Notorious Monster (NM). The only reason to own this item is the rather useful +2 INT that it provides when equipped in the throwing slot. To spawn the NM, one must trade an iron ore (uncommon item) to a ??? marker that randomly pops up in a high-level zone every 15 minutes. The item drops approximately 15% of the time. Woe be to you if you accidentally push the "Use Ranged Weapon" button.
</li><li> Ambrosia — this nectar of the gods provides +7 to all stats for 4 hours. To obtain this item one needs to a) travel to a specific zone to kill enemies that have a 5% chance of dropping a specific craft item, b) travel to vendors that may or may not sell specific crafting supplies based on whether players control certain regions in the game, c) have nearly 100 cooking skill, d) cook a Cursed Soup item, e) travel to an high-level end-game zone where a Notorious Monster spawns every 2~6 hours and has a 33% chance to drop a 'Oblation Abjuration' item, f) give the abjuration and cursed soup to an NPC to receive the "Ambrosia" item. The item buffs used to not persist through death.
</li><li> Amrita — a drink which restores 500HP over 5 minutes. Follows the exact same creation process as the Ambrosia.
</li><li> The Abyssea expansions have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodMode">Primeval Brew</a>, an Abyssea-only one-use item that boosts all your attributes to 999, your HP and MP to 9999, gives you a 500 point HP and MP restoration and 50% TP every three seconds. The downside: It costs two million cruor (An abyssea-only currency that can't be traded for and is usually only gained in small amounts) to buy just one three minute dose. However, it goes from Too Awesome to Use to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> once you defeat the final boss of the Abyssea expansions, when you a receive a key item that drops the cost to a somewhat more palatable 200000 cruor. To put the Brew's power in perspective though: With normal abyssea buffs, an average damage-dealing job can do 3000-6000 damage with one weapon skill on a normal opponent. With a Brew-buffed Corsair with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Armageddon</a>, one can do 75000 to 99999 damage with one weaponskill. And with the 50% TP/3 second gain, one can perform a weaponskill every six seconds.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em> dips in and out of this trope. At the beginning of 2.0, X-Potions, X-Ethers, and Hi-Elixirs were difficult to obtain and craft, but as time went on, not only they were easier to get, but stronger potions were made in later patches. Similarly, a lot of gear used for glamouring purposes tend to be hard to craft, which drives up their prices in the player market, but over time, the items are easier to make and the prices fall. The Palace of the Dead has the Pomander of Rage, an item that transforms the user into a manticore and lets them become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> machine to everything except bosses. Because RNG is fickle, you may barely get any, which causes people to either save them in a dire emergency or use them in conjunction with the Pomander of Fortune, which boosts the drop rate of coffers left behind by defeated enemies.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSNAKEMAN" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BillyVsSNAKEMAN">Billy vs. SNAKEMAN</a></em> has Consumable Kaiju Drops. They are moderately rare items that give a small bonus as long as you have at least one in your inventory<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4sno9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4sno9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4sno9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">multiples don't stack</span> but a <em>massive</em> bonus if you consume one. Naturally, the consume bonuses of such items are far less than the cost of obtaining them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLordOfTheRingsOnline">The Lord of the Rings Online</a></em> occasionally gives consumable items as quest rewards or as part of the in-game lotteries that are bound (can't be sold or traded) and give a significant benefit (stat boosts, or increasing the amount of XP you earn, or counting each kill as double for slayer deeds) for a strictly limited time. In most cases you <em>can</em> buy more of these in the Turbine Store, but in practice you're usually better advised to save your turbine points for stuff that's <em>even better</em>, like items that permanently boost your stats. Limited inventory space does help provide an impetus to actually use the items while they still confer a significant bonus, though (+150 HP is a game-changer when you normally have a couple hundred; by the time you reach the level cap it's a pretty pathetic tank who isn't boasting at least 10k).
</li><li> Prior to the Generation 6 update, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamCapsuleFighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SDGundamCapsuleFighter">SD Gundam Capsule Fighter</a></em> had the OC 100% chip, which allowed players to level up their units to the next Over Custom level without fail, though only to OC 5. However, you could only obtain them via giveaways and events, so you'd only get 2-3 at a time and with dozens of Mobile Suits...
<ul><li> There's also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">special attacks</a> all the Mobile Suits get. They're powerful attacks that let you take out a weaker opponent in one good hit or cut down an opponent's life a good deal. However, using it and missing cuts out a third of your special bar, forcing you to rebuild it to use it again and using it and connecting wipes out the entire bar, forcing you to rebuild it to restore your skills. Most players tend to keep it until they're down to their last sliver of health.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelHeroes">Marvel Heroes</a></em>, various heroes' ultimate skills take a looong time to recharge, up to <strong>20 minutes</strong>. You aren't just gonna use Deadpool's Server Lag to annihilate this group of mooks right? Definitely not even on this sub-boss or elite mob. Maybe not even against this stage's boss, what if you'll need it for the next one?
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LucentHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LucentHeart">Lucent Heart</a></em> has two different healer type skills that are this. While they do boost damage by a sizeable chunk, they do not increase defense, have lengthy cooldowns, and force the user into melee. This is impractical for such classes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aion">Aion</a></em> has this in spades with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic">Spiritmaster</a> class, who specializes in summons and in heaping effects on the enemy. Most of the Spiritmaster's spells are rather normal... and then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">the Cursecloud spell</a>, an area - of - effect spell which has a cooldown of <em>one hour</em>, deals fair initial damage, but shines because it snaps away a good chunk of an afflicted unit's health whenever it casts a spell. Since not all enemies cast spells or have enough HP to require percentage damage, very few situations where Cursecloud is viable exist.
</li><li> Aside from the various rare and powerful items that players might be tempted to hoard, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AuraKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AuraKingdom">Aura Kingdom</a></em> interestingly uses this trope as the reason why the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Reinhardt came to being in the first place. He was a devout knight serving the bishop who had a miraculous artifact that could restore someone to perfect health even if they were inches from death. However, when Reinhardt's wife was ill with a seemingly uncurable illness, the bishop justified his unwillingness to use the artifact to cure her with this trope, believing the artifact should only be used to help save someone powerful and influential who was aiding with the fight against the darkness. When Reinhardt's beloved wife passed away, his anger and resentment toward what he thought was an avoidable tragedy led him to rebel and become the nation's biggest threat.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder9');">    MOBA </div><div class="folder" id="folder9" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is pretty much a defining rule of the MOBA genre; any player character with a single big ability that comes with a long cooldown will always suffer from this. Many players would rather let themselves or an ally die than use these abilities in any situation other than a 5v5 teamfight - indeed, part of the genre's massive learning curve is figuring out which situations it's okay to use a two or more minute cooldown ultimate in.
</li><li> On a similar note, we have <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LeagueOfLegends">League of Legends</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash</a>, a summoner spell available to all champions. It is basically a short range <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashStep">Flash Step</a> with a lot of utility, and it's a given that most summoners will equip it due to League's emphasis on positioning (it is rare to see a side with less than 4 players using Flash). But on the flip side it has a higher cooldown than most champions' ultimate abilities, and so it runs into the same problems of players saving the ability for 'the right moment'. All too often players will use Flash only after any advantage of doing so has been long lost. In fact, Flash is considered so valuable (both offensively and defensively) that forcing your opponent to use theirs without having to expend too much for it (most commonly your own Flash) is considered a win; ganking an opponent and forcing them to blow their Flash to escape is considered a "successful gank", even if they lost nothing else (usually because you can come back for a second gank while their Flash is still down and you have yours).
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder10');">    Platform Game </div><div class="folder" id="folder10" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The Grenades in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em> are rather powerful. You'll want to keep them the first time you play the game, thinking you're going to find a good use for all that power... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">The game soon obliges</a>, and you'll usually end up wasting those grenades when you get killed. Of course, you get a fresh set on your next life, and hopefully a little extra insight on how things work in the game.
</li><li> P-wings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> gives you infinite raccoon flight. This game also had some other items that fell prey to this effect, like the Hammer Suits and the Tanooki Suits. They were just too cool and rare to use anywhere. They're more usable in the <em>All-Stars</em> remake, where you can save items and regain items earned from beating worlds, meaning you can easily farm P-Wings by repeatedly beating World 1. The same goes with Lakitu's Cloud, which allows you to automatically skip a single stage.
<ul><li> That said, while these items absolutely fall under this trope for a first time player, they have a lot more utility to speedrunners, who know enough about the game to know exactly where they would be most useful, and can allow them to achieve speeds that simply wouldn't be possible without using them.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em> gives us a few of these, with shop items that are expensive, or of which you can only have one at a time. Eddie Call can give you items, including 1-ups. The M-Tank acts like <em>Final Fantasy's</em> Elixers: it refills your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> and all your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">Weapon energy</a>. But the biggest user of this trope <em>has</em> to be the Guard Power. It grants double armor for 1 level, but though you'd be tempted to use it against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">Bio-Devil twins</a>, you'd be <em>far</em> better off using it against the final level's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> and Wily's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">3-stage battle</a>.

He has a few benefits on X, especially at first, but with two major drawbacks; if he dies, you cannot call him in again, and you can't use him for boss battles. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Outside of one, anyways, which is how X gets access to the sword for his own use.</a>

Chelsea and the 7 Devils</a></em> has both Bunny and Chelsea dolls. Bunny dolls are optional uses when Bunny bites the big one, and can reload the entire room with Bunny at full health. Chelsea dolls are automatically used when Chelsea gets slagged, and restore Chelsea to full health and Mana. Naturally, players will preserve as many of both of these as possible for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> battles in each game — Chelsea for Bunny, and Septentrion and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bunny and Dechronos</span> for Chelsea.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the second and third games, it took so long to charge up your Dark Eco meter to use your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPoweredEvilSide">Dark Jak</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a>, and you could use up your entire meter in one kill-everything-on-the-screen spray of purple lightning. As a result, it was extremely rare that you'd bother using either...until the end of <em>Jak 3</em>, in which the last few levels end boss was kind enough to provide Light <em>and</em> Dark vents, permitting you to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Super Mode</a> with impunity.
</li><li> The same applied in the second game to the Peace Maker, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShockAndAwe">lightning-death-cannon</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">thing</a> due to its extremely low ammo capacity. The third game could hold double of that when fully upgraded, making Peace Maker sustainable to use, but since purple ammo is now shared by Mass Inverter and Supernova, which uses <em>10</em> shots, it is the last one that won't see much use. Averted in Hero Mode with infinity ammo cheat on, obviously.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a></em>:
<ul><li> First game had the cost of ammo taking much bigger share of your funds than the subsequent games and ammo crates were less frequent, meaning some of more expensive weapons such as Devastator and especially Visibomb Gun could become this if the segment you were on had low number (if any) of ammo crates.
</li><li> The ammo for some weapons does not drop in crates at all. This is especially bad in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankGoingCommando">the second game's</a> Synthenoid, which you can fire at most <em>thrice</em> before running out of ammo. Shield Charger's ammo also has to be bought, though in its case its clip and duration are bigger and upgrade, but it was nerfed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClankUpYourArsenal">in third game</a>, making it closer to this trope. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetDeadlocked" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetDeadlocked">Deadlocked's</a> Harbinger also has normally only three shots and the ammo is costly, though that won't be much issue if you are able to buy the gun.
</li><li> Second game has Zodiac, the ultimate weapon. Its ammo is found in crate, but you better hope you find it there because normally one shot costs 10000 bolts. It does cause a large explosion all around Ratchet, but the long firing animation (which locks you in place and stops if Ratchet takes damage) and the fact that it was ineffective against bosses meant that it was firmly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> gun to begin with, especially compared to the significantly cheaper <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">RYNO II</a>.

You get a maximum of three for the whole game, and although you need to solve a whole lot of its 120+ puzzles to even unlock them, there's still plenty of riddles left to use them on. The problem is that they tend to be so vague and generic they usually don't tell you anything but the current puzzle's most basic approach while the info you actually need to proceed would be much more specific.

<ul><li> The heroes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warcraft">Warcraft</a> II</em> are almost always Too Awesome to Use, as in most missions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroMustSurvive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroMustSurvive">if they die you lose the mission</a>. Only the human side has healers, auto-healing doesn't exist, and you don't always have healers in every mission, so most of the time you keep your hero locked up tight in your base where no one can hurt it, so that you don't accidentally lose the mission by getting them killed. The expansion <em>Beyond the Dark Portal</em> made the heroes into souped-up versions of the regular units, so you might be tempted to use them (and you're often forced to by the mission); in vanilla <em>Warcraft II</em>, they're <em>weaker</em> than regular units (due to not actually counting as the unit they use the sprite of, meaning they don't benefit from unit upgrades) and far too easily killed to ever be risked in battle. Except when you really need that spell only the hero can cast.
</li><li> Heroes were a big problem in most early RTS games, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Starcraft">Starcraft</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AgeOfEmpires">Age of Empires</a></em>. Generally the heroes only found use if they were either expendable or in a no-production mission. Newer games, especially <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarcraftIII">Warcraft III</a></em>, combat this by making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroUnit">Hero Units</a> respawnable and able to be customised and levelled up (though since it has RPG-esque items, it runs into the same problem. Use the one-time Scroll of Resurrection now or wait for an emergency?).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII">Starcraft II</a></em>: Explicitly averted in <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingsOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WingsOfLiberty">Wings Of Liberty</a>'s secret mission- the loading screen actually tells you not to hoard the weapon powerups you find around the level <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">you're being chased by an unkillable monster during the second half, most of the weapons are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One-Hit Kill</a> against mooks that get in your way... and yet you will very likely barely make it to the exit).</span>
<ul><li> Starcraft II has the Co-op mode where players pick specific commanders with certain units and special abilities. Every commander gets powerful cooldown abilities, such as Raynor's use of the Hyperion, Vorazun's Time Stop, or Mira's Space Station Reallocation. The keyword is "cooldown", and some abilities can have in excess of 300 seconds for a cooldown without upgrades and mastery levels. As such, it's possible to see players in the normal or easy difficulty, who don't have a fair grasp on the game yet, save them for if their base gets overrun, but then realize twenty seconds before victory that this dreaded scenario never came true, and they could have used it a half dozen times during the match where it would have made the mission significantly easier. This kind of practice is fairly rare in hard and nonexistent in brutal, but can still pop up in both from time-to-time depending on the co-op partner.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Eldar's relic unit is the Avatar of Khaine, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Physical God</a> with the most health of any unit, very high damage, and makes nearby units much more resistant to morale damage. And yet many players (and the AI) will keep it inside their base, where it can't get into combat. Why? Well, because it also makes every unit build faster, and increases the cap for infantry and vehicles.
</li><li> You can call in Veteran units at any time in the campaign mode from the previous missions. You never will because you might need them when the AI decides you have won too many games in a row and starts to rush you with an unbeatable amount of units.
</li><li> In the second game, the artillery strikes are hard to get and only work in incredibly specific situations (Tank traffic jams) but can win you the game. Averted when you play a longer game mode though, as you will probably get enough resources to use these strikes and other support abilities multiple times.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsRebellion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsRebellion">Star Wars: Rebellion</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Death Star if you played as the Empire. Though costly and time-consuming, building one immediately helped your popular support, but if it left the sector, all the planets would slightly favor the Alliance. Furthermore, if you destroy a planet or if your Death Star is destroyed, you lose popular support throughout the galaxy. But if you've found the Alliance headquarters and have already captured Luke and Mon Mothma, it's a quick win.
</li><li> Conversely, the Alliance has Luke: High in all stats except Diplomacy and Force-sensitive, his Force powers meant he could level up with a certain number of missions. If Vader or Palpatine were present, it would be that much quicker. (In fact, if you have Palpatine under blockade, you can have Luke powerlevel by sabotaging everything on the planet, and then abducting Palpy.) But if Luke encounters Vader or Palpatine, there is a chance he'd be captured instantly, one third of the Imperial victory conditions. But you need to encounter Vader to learn that Leia's Force sensitive, and he wins an event that captures both Vader <em>and</em> Palpatine (a massive two Rebellion victory conditions) if he's used enough that he completes enough missions to promote to Jedi Knight or higher. The event happens automatically as well, so if you decide that he is indeed too awesome to use, you'll end up losing him to the Empire for no reason at all.
</li><li> There's also the fact that the game randomly selects who will be Force sensitive (aside from the canonically required characters) each time you play. While there's no guarantee that your Force-sensitive characters will be any good, if you'll lucky enough to end up with a Force sensitive Thrawn, for example (who has naturally high stats to begin with, and Force training increases all stats), you'll probably not want to risk losing him. Especially since, unlike Palpatine and Vader, he can be <em>killed</em> in battle, thus eliminating the possibility of a rescue mission.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a> 2</em>:
<ul><li> Purple Pikmin. They have ridiculously high attack power and can stun enemies if they land on them, but they're incredibly slow and lack any immunities like other Pikmin types, and on top of that they can only be created through rare Candypop Buds underground, unlike the primary Pikmin which come from Onions. Considering most bosses ingame either rely on a specific immunity or being able to get out of an attack quickly, some players prefer to use Red Pikmin than risk losing their Purples, due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical">only having slightly lower attack power than Purples, but are much quicker and plentiful.</a> Also, there's the issue of requiring 100 Purple Pikmin to lift a dumbbell in Wistful Wild, which encourages players to save them until reaching that part.
</li><li> There's also Bitter Spray, which completely immobilizes enemies and makes even the toughest bosses complete jokes. To balance this out though, they are much rarer to come by than the Spicy Spray, which just powers up a Pikmin's attack and speed, and the berry plants needed to make them are often in inconvient locations. As such, most players just save them for when they're really in a jam and there's no other way out. (Usually when faced with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">Spotty Bulbears</a>.)

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NetHack">NetHack</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the late game, certain expendable items <em>do</em> become almost useless - namely scrolls and potions. (No need to hurl potions of paralysis at a monster when you can smite it with Excalibur, after all.) Almost, because you can dip potions and scrolls in water to blank them out; "blank" potions of water can be transformed with an altar into holy water, an essential de-cursing tool, while blank scrolls let you write a new magic scroll with a magic marker (itself an example of this trope, rare and versatile but wears out quickly). This encourages hoarding potions and scrolls that you don't intend to use in their current form, just in case you get the chance to remake them into something better.
</li><li> The most dramatic example, however, is the wand of wishing, a limited-use item that lets you summon almost any item or object. Only one of these is guaranteed to spawn, and you're likely to reach the end of the game with a few charges left on it, saved for a dire emergency that never happened. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingTryingToKillYou">In this game</a>, though, being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared">Crazy-Prepared</a> is a good strategy.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlashEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlashEm">Slash'EM</a></em>, a <em>NetHack</em> variant, may come across the Houchou, an artifact-level spoon. Throwing this spoon at a monster results in an instant kill, after which the artifact is destroyed. <em>Slash'EM</em> mostly averts this trope, though, because just about every player has their own idea of which single creature in the game deserves skipping.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DungeonCrawl">Dungeon Crawl</a></em>, many a run has ended <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Permadeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Permadeath">permanently</a> because a player was too proud to use that fancy wand when they and the orc they were facing were both at death's door, and the player was <em>certain</em> that next blow would strike true. Being a good <em>Dungeon Crawl</em> player is very much about knowing when to avert this; in a game with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Permadeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Permadeath">permadeath</a>, a powerful tool sitting on your corpse might as well have not existed at all.
</li><li> Being based on the same principle, but adding in an overworld and the ability to buy storage houses... let's just say it is very common to have a ginormous amount of these in <a class="urllink" href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/rfish/index_e.html">Elona.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> One example is prayer, which will remove negative statuses, uncurse your equipment and protect you from harmful magic for a while...which will also cost one tenth of your accrued Favor with your God, which is only built back up from offering corpses and God-specific items at altars. Also, praying above certain Favor tresholds will give you certain gifts to a God, so doing this will set you back if you aim to get the gifts.
</li><li> Rods of Wishing, for obvious reasons.
</li><li> The Astral Light Pen is one of the rarest and most valuable item in the <em>Elona+</em> expansion, allowing you to recruit a clone of any enemy you have a high relationship with in your party. Other than the grueling choice of which of the many unique NPCs to copy, this also creates the added effect of inflicting this trope on Tokens of Friendship and Love Potions, which are the only way to meet the requirements with hostile monsters.
</li></ul></li><li> Summon feathers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChocobosDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChocobosDungeon">Chocobo's Dungeon</a></em> allowed you to replace your partner with far more powerful summon creatures. This meant calling to your aid allies that could take down the game's bonus boss singlehandedly while taking only pitiful damage in return. The downside is that, should they actually die, you lose the feather you likely spent hours trying to get your hands on. A random summon feather takes away that risk but doesn't give you the option of selection.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfTheWinds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastleOfTheWinds">Castle of the Winds</a></em>, you randomly find magic wands that can cast all kinds of spells, even the room-clearing Ball spells, with as much as a dozen charges. Even if you do put one in your belt, you'll probably forget you have it.
</li><li> Spells in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheConsumingShadow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheConsumingShadow">The Consuming Shadow</a></em> packs quite a punch in battle and have several beneficial uses outside combat. The problem is that they put quite a drain on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanityMeter">Sanity Meter</a>, and you <em>really</em> don't want the protagonist to go insane before the end-game, especially since he can't cast spells with too low sanity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/SunlessSea">Sunless Sea</a></em>: The Icarus in Black is, technically, the best weapon in the game; the damage it causes is so absurd it can kill the most powerful beast in the entire game in two shots at most. However, the ammunition is similarly absurd: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbnormalAmmo">Angry, suicidal and very skilled monster-hunters that want to die a glorious death</a>. Very few places have those, they are all remote, and they all want a payment big enough that their families can take care of themselves all on their own afterwards. All in all, a thousand echoes per shot in the best of cases where the most expensive thing in the game, a giant dreadnought, costs thirty thousand; you are <em>probably</em> not going to use it more than twice.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac">The Binding of Isaac</a></em>:
<ul><li> Many active items have this, with potential room-clearing effects being held until the absolute perfect moment. The granddaddy of these is Mega Blast, an item that fires a laser that obliterates everything in a wide area for 15 seconds, which persists through rooms <em>and floors</em>, but has a ridiculous 12-room charge time and is only charged by 3 when Isaac picks up a battery.
</li><li> Worse than rechargable items is any single-use active item. These often have absurd effects like destroying all rocks and killing most enemies on the entire floor and revealing every secret room, to doubling every item in the current room. It's not unusal to see players hold these thing until the absolute perfect time. This behavior is even mocked by Pandora's Box, an item that gives you a different reward based on which floor it was used on, with each floor getting better and better, until the final floor which gives you either nothing or a single penny.
</li><li> The Algiz rune, which provides total invulnerability for 30 whole seconds then is used up, is almost never used except to cheese any particularly tough boss unless Blank Card is involved. With Blank Card, it and any other rune can be used every four rooms, but getting it is not a guarantee.
</li><li> The Jera rune doubles any pickups, including treasure chests, even in the two final floors where (non-red) chests have guaranteed items. Without Blank Card, they're typically held on to until near the end of the game to get eight items from the Chest floor rather than four, unless the player is desperate for extra health or some other sort of consumable.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnterTheGungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EnterTheGungeon">Enter the Gungeon</a></em>, literally <em>every</em> gun except your starting pistol can become this when it comes to clearing regular rooms, at least for the first couple of floors. After that, it continues to apply to whatever your most powerful gun is, because there's always a chance you won't find any new ones on that floor. Blanks, too, tend to be hoarded until the boss fight, because a few well-timed blanks can mean beating the boss without taking any damage at all, which nets you an extra <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeartContainer">Heart Container</a>.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Shoot-'Em-Up </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Bombs are very useful in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFox">Star Fox</a></em>, and are instrumental in a few boss fights. You don't find yourself using them too often, though, do you? Doubly so because killing multiple enemies with a single Bomb does not offer the same cluster-kill bonus that doing the same with a charge shot does. It mostly comes down to a matter of only using it on enemies that you KNOW you can't clear out anyway, and memorizing the points where more bombs appear so you can be sure a replacement is right around the corner.
</li><li> The Climax Mode <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurnerClimax" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AfterBurnerClimax">After Burner Climax</a></em>, which gives you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletTime">Bullet Time</a> and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacrossMissileMassacre">Macross Missile Massacre</a>, does not come that rarely, but it's still possible to fall into this mentality as there's a chance you burn it on one enemy wave only for an even larger wave of enemy planes to show up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThunderForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ThunderForce">Thunder Force</a> III</em> onwards, dying takes away your current weapon unless it's Twin Shot or Back Shot, your initial weapons. Less experienced players who are aware of this penalty may find themselves refusing to use the better weapons, out of fear of losing them.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMansSky">No Man's Sky</a></em>: There are several materials in the game that are exceedingly rare (and in many cases heavily defended), but are required components for the most advanced upgrades to suit tech or shipboard weapons. Players who are lucky enough to gather these probably won't want to use them due to the frequency with which ships and survival gear tend to be swapped out. What's even worse is the fact that dismantling the tech might not even return some of these materials. Luckily, the post-release addition of Base Vaults helps offset this somewhat.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Spore">Spore</a></em> has a "Staff of Life" which, when used, can instantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Terraform">Terraform</a> a planet of your choosing into a tier-3 world, essentially the best rating for a planet's habitability.

Since you can also terraform a world by manually tweaking the planet's temperature and atmosphere with other, rechargeable tools, it's not uncommon to just never use the Staff and have it sitting at 42 uses permanently.

There are only 5 places in the game where they can be found (1 of which is only available in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">requires a very specific action to trigger</a>).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nearly all entries in the series have players finding themselves with dozens of magazines worth of ammunition for their weapons, and their larger guns all but unused by the time they meet the final enemy, which most likely cannot be hurt by any of those weapons, even the big-ticket firearms. Sometimes, though, they're nice enough to make it fairly obvious what you're saving them up for by making every other option you have practical suicide (e.g. by the fifth time in a row you've been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">decapitated by a Hunter</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">tentacle'd to death by Nemesis</a>, it's pretty clear you can go ahead and start using that nice, shiny magnum now).
</li><li> Ink Ribbons. While most typewriters have at least one and possibly as many as three ribbons nearby, the prospect of running out and <em>being unable to save</em> is quite scary for many players.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica">Resident Evil  Code: Veronica</a></em>, the gunpowder for the bowgun turns the weakest weapon in the game into a full on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpider">Demonic Spider</a> splatterer. The problem is, there are only 50 charges in the entire game. And if you never brought Rodrigo the hemostat and got Claire's lockpicks back, there'll be even less as there are 2 suitcases of the stuff that can only be unlocked with the lockpicks. There is also the Magnum, which you'll definitely need for the later bosses, and if you left the Fire Extinguisher (which you need to extinguish the fire blocking the path to it) behind in the security box, it'll be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">unobtainable</a>. Best part? There are only <em>eighteen</em> rounds for it in the whole game, and six of those come with the gun.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil3Nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></em> has only one set of magnum rounds you can find in the game. If you want to get more, you have to make Gunpowder CCC, which comes from three Gunpowder C, which also comes from mixing Gunpowder A and B together. Making your own magnum rounds is great, but now you run into the issue of sacrificing extra handgun and shotgun ammo, which you will always need. Freeze rounds for the grenade launcher is the rarest ammo type in the game. Depending on what choice you made on the runaway train, Carlos can give you freeze rounds and that is the only time you can actually get it. You have to make freeze rounds yourself if you want some, which also means giving up handgun and shotgun ammo to create the freeze rounds. Freeze rounds heavily cripples most enemies, including Nemesis himself. Most people will be saving freeze grenades specifically for Nemesis.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheEvilWithin">The Evil Within</a></em> there's the Rocket Launcher that, while severely underpowered compared to its <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> cousin, is still a very powerful BFG in its own right. However, for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> reward it only comes with a sorely limited amount of 21 shots that can never be replenished. At all. And there are so many ways to waste a rocket too, combined with the Launcher's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a> nature it tends to end up as a paperweight.

Ammo pickups for bigger guns range from ultra-rare (Sniper Rifle) to nonexistent (Assault Rifle, Flamethrower &amp; Magnum), but you can use the commonly-found gunpowder to make more. All use a lot of gunpowder to make, but none of your weapons can be made useless from a lack of the proper gun food.

It's the strongest film in the entire game and can dish out massive amounts of damage, even to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>. However, there is only a very limited supply in each playthrough and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">they tend to have to be found in random locations</a>, so even if the player has it, they are unlikely to want to waste this precious film.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill">Silent Hill</a></em>:
<ul><li> The more powerful weapons, such as the Rifle in the first two games and the Submachine Gun in the third, tend to have the scarcest ammo and should be saved for major boss fights. The Ampoule, an item that heals all of your health no matter how badly hurt you were, also suffers from the same scarcity and often ends up never used at all.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill3">Silent Hill 3</a></em>: Your end game score will be reduced if you use any of the Extra weapons in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> (Beam Sabre, Gold and Silver Pipes, Flamethrower, Unlimited Machine Gun). Only a problem if you're trying for a perfect score
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill4">Silent Hill 4</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhostsAreDifferent">unkillable Victim ghosts</a> that haunt the player throughout the entire game. Your best defense are the Swords of Obedience (there's only five of them) and the even rarer Silver Bullets (there's only three, the last of which is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">Bragging Rights Reward</a>). Swords will pin down a fallen Victim for the remainder of the game; Silver Bullets will instantly "down" a Victim. Usually, players save the Swords for pinning down the four toughest Victims <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cynthia, Jasper, Andrew and Richard</span>, while hogging the Silver Bullets for the latter two, essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequenceBreaking">bypassing two of the hardest fights in the game</a>.
</li><li> Holy Candles and Saint Medallions. Both are effective means of defense against Victims, and come pretty early in the game, but players may choose to start saving them for the second half of the game, when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the apartment starts suffering Hauntings whose exorcism directly influences the ending of the game</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHillOrigins">Silent Hill: 0rigins</a></em> has one of the largest weapons' count in the series (including six kinds of firearms). Most of them, however, are commonplace depot appliances. The more powerful ones break after a single use, so players want to save them for boss fights and the like. But there's <em>so many</em> of them that Travis usually ends the game with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BagOfHolding">dozens of TV sets, toasters, blenders and hammers in his pockets</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Lovecraft-inspired Mystery-Survivalhorror game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EternalDarkness">Eternal Darkness</a></em>, you will, except for the first chapter, never use healing items since they have only a limited amount of uses and you will often very early find the Tome of Eternal Darkness, which lets you cast Healing Spells among others and your Mana recharges. The same can be said about your Guns and other weapons that require ammo, because the moment you find a melee weapon you wont use your guns on normal zombies any more and only save them for the arcane horrors and Gurdians. Or not even on them, but you will save them for the really big Eldritch Abominations at the end of the chapter, only to find that they are immune to bullets. Also, the chapters often end very abruptly, and your items do not get transferred to the present, so you will probably fight yourself through the chapter only with melee weapons and spells to save your ammo, and then see it all gone due to the chapter ending.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Illbleed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Illbleed">Illbleed</a></em>. There are several rare and valuable items that can only be found in levels, along with supplies you can buy in the hub zone. Aside from upgrade parts that roll over from stage to stage, all other goodies will disappear from your inventory once a level is cleared, so you have no reason to hang onto the stuff. In fact, it's recommended to use them up to fully heal yourself just before you beat a stage, since prize money is deducted if your stats fall under par.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadlyPremonition">Deadly Premonition</a></em> has Thomas' Biscuit. You're only ever given two in the game; they refill all of your hunger and tiredness, as well as your health and stamina, <em>and</em> keep them low for longer. The first one given to you by the game is shortly before the final boss fight, meaning most players will probably use it there, but the other one comes during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">Boss Rush</a> with ample opportunities for saving between, meaning the second biscuit is likely to sit around in player's inventories all through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayableEpilogue">Playable Epilogue</a>.

<ul><li> The Smart Bomb in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienSwarm">Alien Swarm</a></em>. When you unlock it, you can carry only one. It's pretty much the same as the Hornet Barrage, but 5 of them. It fires so many damn rockets that a huge swarm can easily be dispatched with the item. However, since you can only hold 1, you'll have a tough time figuring out when is the best time to use it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/RatchetAndClank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>:</em>
<ul><li> For some weapons, you can't find ammo in crates or as an enemy drop. This isn't problem for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClank2002" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClank2002">R.Y.N.O</a> or Tesla Barrier <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/RatchetAndClank">in second game</a> (unless you're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneSidequest">searching for Moonstones</a>) since they have big enough ammo clip, but some weapons like Synthenoid from second game have only three shots and the power is rather weak, making them a pain to upgrade unless you're willing to return to vendor through half of level, and also limiting their use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RatchetAndClankFutureToolsOfDestruction">Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</a></em> has this with the Alpha Disruptor. You get it for free on Sargasso, and it deals jaw dropping damage out of the starting gate, capable of killing any normal mook in one hit and able to bring down massive enemies like Leviathans in just a few shotsand further upgrades make it the most powerful weapon in the game, even moreso than the R.Y.N.O. IV. Unfortunately, its awesome power is quickly set back by three major handicapsfirst, it has truly abysmal ammo (4 at first, upgradable to 5). Second, it has a very slow rate of fire without buying expensive raritanium upgrades and the weapon requires charging before firing a shot, making it difficult to hit fast moving targets with it. And third, it only fires in a straight line like a Sniper Rifle, which makes it great for hitting huge targets like bosses and leviathans, but very impractical for dealing with large, spread out crowds or individual mooksand while it does have an auto lock on function, this makes it even harder to use against a crowd of enemies, since it can lock onto the wrong target by accident.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> has this with the rocket launcher, which is very powerful (can one-hit just about every boss in the game), but is still better to sell for cash and use that to upgrade one of your guns that gets more than one use.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> ends up playing this trope semi-straight (or at least straighter than the previous game did) due to its more limited inventory system. With only nine slots available per character, space is at a premium and it's usually best to rely on the weapon you have the most ammo for, if only to keep your inventory from being clogged with four or five superfluous ammo boxes. Sadly, the ammunition for the best weapons in the game (magnums and the grenade launcher) are almost impossible to find. And even when you <em>do</em> find magnum and grenade rounds chances are you won't have either of those weapons in your inventory since you so prudently chose to store them away in your hammerspace inventory accessible only in between chapters. However, while there's nothing to be done about the inventory space, the game also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">doesn't think to take away items you picked up if you quit a chapter</a>, so you once you find them you can stockpile magnum ammo, grenade rounds, and even rocket launchers with relative ease.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2">Splatoon 2</a></em> Salmon Run mode: you have 2 specials and 3 waves. Unlike other modes, specials do not recharge so players used to the other modes are suddenly hit with the issue of finite supply, and being splatted does not lose their charge so the "use it or lose it" factor is not there. Not using them during the first 2 waves can be justified by wave 3 being the toughest - but by then, a player can get used to dealing with the salmonids without specials, and it is all too easy to only remember the specials are there when the final wave is over.

They also take forever to recharge, so you can't use one back-to-back for multiple emergencies.

An Insta-Monkey lets you place a pre-upgraded tower for free. High-tier Instas can potentially save you tens or hundreds thousands of cash. On the other hand, login bonuses only give you low-tier ones every few days, and the other way to get them is reaching every 100 round in a game. Even then, you'll mostly get Tier 3 ones. Tier 4 Instas are rare, and you'll need to play Expert maps for a decent chance of them. Tier 5 ones are practically unobtainable outside of special events.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> The unique S-rank staves in various games (e.g. the Ashera Staff in <em>Path of Radiance</em>). They heal all your allies on the battlefield as well as removing all status ailments <em>and</em> give enough experience to the caster for a level up. But they only have three uses, and in order to use them at all you need an S-rank in staves (which has no other purpose and, in some games, stops you from S-ranking any other weapon type). This at least is not so much a problem in <em>Radiant Dawn</em>, because you only get the Ashera Staff from a character (whose method of recruitment approaches a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>) that joins in the last chapter, and it can be freely used in the fight with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li><li> And in a similar case, the Hammerne staff, which can repair almost any item in the game. Again, three uses before it's gone forever. However, the Hammerne staff can be used to repair <em>other</em> Too Awesome To Use items and weapons.
</li><li> Most of the long-range magic items suffer from this trope. They're quite powerful and can be used from very far away, but are not common and have only 5 uses. In <em>Radiant Dawn</em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if you have them blessed near the end of the game, they become infinitely usable making them partial <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game Breakers</a>.</span>
</li><li> The majority of S ranked, Brave, and special weapons tend to fall under this trope. For example, the Vague Katti is a decently powerful sword, but its true strength lies in its 35% increased chance of landing a Critical Hit. Too bad it only has enough uses to be good for one or two chapters. Such weapons tend to be hoarded until the final chapters, making the game up to that point harder than it needs to be, and making said final chapters sometimes laughable.
</li><li> <em>The Blazing Blade</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">references this</a> when a character warns not to put too much thought into who gets an item; 'holding onto a useful item does no one any good'. However, said NPC appears in Lyn's mode, and saving the item will help up your funds ranking. A higher funds ranking means Lyn has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">better gem</a> in her inventory in Eliwood/Hector mode, so ironically, this is the one time not using an item IS helpful (though it's debatable whether the better funds ranking and the extra gold later on outweigh the stat bonus from using the item right away).
</li><li> <em>The Binding Blade</em> actually <strong>forces</strong> this behavior. You have access to the game's ultimate weapons very early, but they have few uses, and in order to get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">best ending</a> they all need to be intact by the time you beat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>. Even though you technically CAN use them 1/3 of the way through the game, most players won't until the very end.
</li><li> Going for an overall A Funds ranking also enforces this kind of behavior, as it's based on the total monetary worth of <em>all</em> items in your posession. Expect the wast majority of Silver weapons to get hoarded in the convoy and never used. Also note many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeriousBusiness">forum members</a> consider this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StopHavingFunGuys">the only way to play.</a>
</li><li> Myrrh from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">The Sacred Stones</a></em> is an example of a <em>character</em> that is too awesome to use. She is a cute person that also happens to be an extremely powerful dragon, but she required her Dragonstone to attack. Every attack, even counterattacks, costs one charge. The problem is that it only has fifty charges, there's no way to repair it (outside of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBug">Good Bad Bug</a>) and the one in her possession is the only Dragonstone in the game. Use it up and Myrrh will become completely useless. (The trick is to learn when to start using her so her level is high enough to be useful—yes, part of those 50 charges must be used for leveling her up—and yet leave the Dragonstone with enough charges to maul the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueFinalBoss">True Final Boss</a>.)
<ul><li> Many other Manaketes have similar downsides. Fa in <em>The Binding Blade</em> has only <em>thirty</em> uses on her Dragonstone, meaning she tends to run dry pretty darn quickly if she's used with any regularity.
</li></ul></li><li> Lessened in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Awakening</a></em> with the Armsthrift skill, which stops weapons from eroding. It activates on a percentage chance using double the characters luck stat. When a character has a luck stat (plus bonuses) of 50 or greater, powerful weapons can be used to your heart's content.
</li><li> <em>Awakening</em> also has the added bonus that most items that have tended to be impossibly rare in the past, such as permanent stat-boosters, Brave Weapons, etc., often have some method of gaining more. Granted, they're often from rare means such as random merchants just happening to show up with them, or through paid DLC, but at least there's <em>some</em> way to get more, instead of them being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost</a>. This is even more exemplified if one of the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotPass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpotPass">Spot Pass</a> teams has it in their shop inventory; initially after the game's release one would need to wait over the course of several months for their release, but now that they're all out there (and can be resummoned an infinite number of times), a new player can bring these teams onto the map instantly and, provided they have the money, start buying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> weapons and spells immediately and infinitely.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a></em> has Stamina Potions, Dueling Crests, and Light's Blessings. The Light's Blessing is the worst of them all as you can only get them through certain circumstances. And you can only get three of them through the My Nintendo rewards system.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em>. Staves are still limited-use, but weapons aren't anymore, allowing your army to swing those fancy high-tier weapons all day every day. <em>However</em>, the tradeoff is that more powerful weapons come with drawbacks such as debuffs or reduced evasion, meaning that more common weapons remain practical to use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em>:
<ul><li> As you can only buy <em>one</em> of each Brave-tier weapon in any save file, regardless of what your professor rank is, most players stop at Silver, which is still strong enough to carry characters even in the late-game. Brave weapons are rare finds on the battlefield (and if one has online functionality, rusted Brave weapons can be found from time to time), but even so, it is not often enough to justify their use.
</li><li> Nine of the thirteen Heroes Relics are this. To repair, they require Umbral Steel, which is a rare ore found by completing optional battles, but their durability is usually no more than 25 and they will often hit twice. The only exceptions are the accessories (Thyrsus, the Aegis Shield, and the Rafail Gem), as they do not have weapon durability, and the Sword of the Creator, which can be restored simply by Resting on a given Saturday for +5 durability per rest.
</li><li> Until you unlock the ability to actually buy them from Anna's Secret Shop, Elixirs fall into this category, especially because characters are usually still only in the 20s and 30s of HP at that point. This makes Concoctions still the most efficient healing items to use at that point.

These are alien war machines left on Planet that really kick ass, especially the Mark 3. Problem? They are rare, and damage to them can never be repaired. So despite having very good weapons for when you pick them up, they tend to sit around as garrison units, because they have an ability that makes them better police. They're also good stopgaps in the case of mindworm swarms, as they have not only good defense but (in the mark 1 and 2 versions) additional defenses against psi attacks. Just be sure to never let them get into <em>real</em> combat.
</li><li> In most normal gameplay, you won't need to use the Jonathan Ingram card in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearAcid">Metal Gear Ac!d</a></em>, despite it being one of the most powerful ones in the game. Ingram removes twenty COST from your character, far beyond the twelve COST removed by the most powerful conventional COST reduction card - but, because Jonathan Ingram is so powerful, it tends not to get used.

Despite being relatively common or even purchasable, players abhorred using them and ended up with dozens of them by the end-game. This is averted post <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsZ">Super Robot Wars Z</a></em>, where said items can now be used once per map without being consumed.

However, using them in this fashion had a chance of breaking them. While some of the weaker katanas were easily purchased (including, fortunately, one that restored allies' health), the most powerful ones were available only as rewards in battle (or via stealing from enemies). While you could just equip said katanas and use them for melee attacks to your heart's content, the special attack (which could break the katana) wound up never used.
</li><li> See that beautiful Allmighty Antilaw in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em>? It allows you to completely nullify all laws in the battle. Which means that they are the ultimate anti-judge weapon. But then it should be noted that it is limited to very certain plot points of the game. This extends to a lesser extent to the R level law cards which are still rare, but they can keep returning to the card shop. But good luck on getting yourself to use them too because often times you will just stomach the laws to begin with.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em> has Intuition Points that allow you to find all clues and ease questioning, you also only get a limited amount of them and can only have 5 at once. This is inverted after you have completed the story, which lets you go back to any previous case and always start with 5 Intuition Points. This encourages using them to achieve a perfect rank on that case.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>:
<ul><li> In most games, getting a vehicle you want to keep generally means it will stay in the garage forever, since if you take it to do a mission, you will likely have to get out of it and risk it disappearing, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryCarIsAPinto">they are ridiculously easy to destroy</a>. Except the everything-proof variety. Everything meaning collision, fire, and bullets.
</li><li> This is taken to insane lengths in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoIII">Grand Theft Auto III</a></em>. Certain plot-involved cars are immune to certain things, such as bullets, fire, explosions, and wrecks. Most of these cars could only be obtained ONCE per game and often required hours of trial and error to get. Many players spent many hours collecting them, just to have them waste away in a garage, even though some missions almost require one to complete.
</li><li> Another notable mention of this trope are the combine harvesters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoSanAndreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a></em>. These vehicles had the unique and delightfully sadistic feature of turning crops of pedestrians into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gorn">neatly bundled up bales of body parts</a>. Unfortunately, the harvesters are rare, encountered only at certain times in rural areas. In addition, almost all of them are locked and can only be accessed by killing the driver of one already in use. Even after obtaining one, the size of the vehicle makes it difficult to move in populated areas and impossible to fit into a garage for safe keeping. Its slow speed and bad handling make the player easy for law enforcers (who inevitably start to show up after a few good mauls) to catch. Finally, if the player decides to exit the vehicle for any reason, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AtomicFBomb">the door locks behind them</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoMoreHeroes">No More Heroes</a></em> has Anarchy in the Galaxy, the most devastating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> move in the game that clears the entire screen of enemies. It's also the <em>only</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a> that can not only be triggered at will (thus avoiding every other one's problem of almost always being gained from the <em>last</em> kill in a room), but <em>stacks</em> as well in case you get more than one over the course of a level, and you get a sizeable cash bonus if you make it through the level without using it. The cash bonus increases on subsequent playthroughs. It also does squat to bosses.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Minecraft">Minecraft</a></em>:
<ul><li> The original Golden Apples were the <em>king</em> of Minecraft's Too Awesome To Use throne. At the time, red apples alone were incredibly rare, only being found occasionally in dungeons — this only several updates after <em>golden</em> apples could found that way — or dropping off Notch, the game developer, should he grace your server. Then, you had to encase that red apple in 8 <em>blocks</em> of gold. A gold block takes 9 gold ingots. You would have to mine and smelt 72 blocks of the fairly rare gold ore in order to have enough material to make a single golden apple. And then, since hunger didn't exist yet, its only effect was to fully heal you, something you could get much more cheaply from cake. Later updates after the hunger system existed boosted the 8-block golden apple's power to better match its expense, made red apples easily farmable, and added a less-potent golden apple made from gold ingots, making the whole thing much more practical.
</li><li> Some consider diamond equipment to be this. A pick-axe made of diamond mines faster and lasts a lot longer than one made of iron or stone... but it still breaks eventually, and if you're killed by underground monsters or a lava flow, you risk losing it forever. Similarly, diamond armor offers a great deal of protection, and diamond swords deal 25% more damage than iron swords, but since they're only useful in combat, there's a serious risk of losing them long before their unparalleled durability runs out, especially when diamond armor provides not much more protection than iron, which is plentiful. Diamond is found deep within the earth, usually near lava, and is even rarer than gold. It can still be worth using with proper branch mining techniques, but it is time-consuming to hunt for. The introduction of the Mending enchantment reduced this significantly.
</li><li> Ender Pearls. Endermen drop them when killed but they are difficult to kill quickly due to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportSpam">Teleport Spam</a> and the drop rate of the pearl is low. Throwing a pearl will teleport the player wherever it lands (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints">hurt you when used</a> to prevent people from spamming the pearls nilly willy), making them excellent tools to climb hills or to cross large gaps, but since the pearls are not common, players will either store them up and never use them or wait for the worst possible scenario to happen before using them. On top of that, an ender pearl can be combined with blaze powder to create an Eye of Ender, and you'll need up to a dozen every time you want to activate a stronghold portal to The End, not counting however many you use up trying to locate the stronghold. For bonus points, as of 1.9, they are the only way to traverse the End to find End Cities—you can't even get to the portal that sends you between the mainland and the islands without one. Sure, the End is full of Endermen to kill for more pearls if need be, but considering how hard they are to fight, do you really want to make yourself go through that?
</li><li> Enchanted tools and armor. You can get some nifty effects for your items, such as setting mobs on fire or increasing the diamond drop rate. However, the enchantments you receive are pretty unpredictable, and the experience cost increases quadratically with the enchantment level. You'd have to kill 77 hostile mobs for level 10, 651 hostile mobs for level 30, or 1785 hostile mobs for the maximum, level 50. Furthermore, enchanted items can't be repaired without stripping the enchantment. They basically have all the drawbacks of diamond equipment taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. Fortunately, later updates made several changes that made them more practical: The level required for maximum enchantments was reduced to thirty, they consume only a portion of the experience required to unlock them, and they can be repaired on anvils. A new enchantment called Mending was also added which allows the item to be directly repaired from collected XP. Although this enchantment can only be acquired from trading with villagers or from treasure chests, it effectively allows an item to last forever as long as you're careful not to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">use their last hitpoint</a> or drop them in lava.
</li><li> Potions are risky to use at most. Health and regeneration potions are handy to have since they can directly restore your health regardless of your hunger level, swift potions boosts your speed, strength potions gives your damage a boost, and fire resistance potions makes you immune to fire and lava. However, most of the ingredients needed are difficult to find and the majority of them are found in the Nether where the most difficult monsters are found and hold drops needed to craft the potions. Once you actually get the ingredients and craft the potions, you may be tempted to not use them at all in fear of wasting their effects if you get killed.
</li></ul></li><li> Depending on your playing style, the blunderbuss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemptionUndeadNightmare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemptionUndeadNightmare">Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare</a></em> may qualify. Hands-down the most powerful gun in the game, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousGibs">blasts zombies into a fine pink mist</a> with one shot (several of them if they happen to be in a tight cluster). The ammo is made from dead zombie parts (ribs, eyes, ears, and tongues according to the <a class="urllink" href="http://reddead.wikia.com/wiki/Blunderbuss">RDR Wiki<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>) and it takes ten zombie parts to make one unit of blunderbuss ammo. However, if you blast the undead apart with the blunderbuss you can't loot their bodies for ammo ingredients, which forces you to kill zombies normally. If you can kill 10+ zombies with conventional weapons you probably don't need the blunderbuss anyway.
<ul><li> On a similar note, the Explosive Rifle from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RedDeadRedemption">Red Dead Redemption</a></em> may qualify as well; it is a powerful, experimental, single-shot rifle added to the game by a DLC pack. It takes a shitload of money to buy, and while it is available for half the price, this feature only comes when the player has a high enough honor (meaning they have to play throughout most of the game not taking advantage of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameCrueltyPotential">Video Game Cruelty Potential</a>). Furthermore, the rifle can only be purchased in the final region unlocked in the game. And if the player does get the rifle, they will find it to be an overpowered beauty which completely annihilates any enemies and animals, removing the ability to loot them, and has a maximum bullet limit of 15 bullets. Sure, they can expand this to 30, but to do so, the player requires the purchasing of an additional item-the bandolier. Thankfully, this item is available near the beginning of the game and is relatively cheap.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Terraria">Terraria</a></em> has the Star Cannon. Shot for shot, it's the most powerful weapon in the game, and it can be crafted fairly early. The catch is that it uses Fallen Stars as ammo. Fallen Stars are dropped at a very low rate at night (you'll get maybe ten or twelve if you scour the earth), are used in many other crafting recipes (including the essential Mana Crystals), and can't be reused once fired. Furthermore, the Star Cannon has a ludicrously high rate of fire, so even with armor that reduces your ammo consumption, you'll end up burning through your star stockpile at a fairly quick speed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mercenaries">Mercenaries: World In Flames</a></em> has this issue with its various Airstrikes/Supply drops. If you had a strike available you need only aim at the target area, and call down the thunder/goods. They can even be found at a decent frequency. But you are constantly in paranoia that your large mortar strike won't be as useful here clearing out a random enemy outpost, as it would <em>there</em>... the next enemy outpost. There's only one instance where an airstrike is necessary, and you use a <em>nuclear bunker buster</em> for that one. Aside from that, players are likely to have enough large munitions stocked up to support a small army.
</li><li> Missile launchers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TerraTech">TerraTech</a></em> are the most versatile and among the most powerful weapons in the game, but they are also expensive and prone to blowing up after a few hits. Players tend to hoard them until they have enough to bulldoze anything in their path.

<ul><li> The queen in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> verges on this, at least in the beginning of the game. A common piece of advice to beginners is to never bring your queen out too early, as while it is the most powerful piece, that actually makes it vulnerable in the opening due to the fact that it can be chased around and trapped by less valuable pieces. Of course, there are always exceptions to this.
</li><li> The Admiral in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a> Boardgame gets 2 nuke tokens he can use to demolish entire space sectors and have a high chance to destroy the incredibly dangerous cylon carrier basestars in one quick attack. But you only got two, and it can be a 4 hour game. There might come a situation where they are more needed than right now. Better hold on to them I guess.
<ul><li> The Exodus Expansion brings in a skillcard for every skill deck that has a value of 6, more than any other skillcard. So it is incredibly powerful to play into skillchecks. But all of those cards also have a very powerful Action printed on them. So you are torn apart between keeping it for some skillcheck or using it for its awesome powers. The engineering skillcard of that tier allows that player to build an additional nuke...

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder25');">    Card Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder25" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Some cards in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering">Magic: The Gathering</a></em> are specifically designed to invoke this trope, by giving you a small cheap effect and/or a large expensive effect. Good players will know when getting it out now is more important than making it more powerful; bad players will not.
<ul><li> One such example is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wizards.com/magic/autocard.asp?name=Kavu%5BTitan">Kavu Titan;<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> when they were playtesting Invasion and someone lent now-head Designer Mark Rosewater a deck to use without mentioning that the Grizzly Bears (a basic 2-mana card with two power/toughness, similar to Kavu Titan without its kicker) were supposed to be proxies for Kavu Titans. Mark went 4-0 the first week, and then upon being told that they were actually Titans, he went 2-2 the next week, wanting to hold back to use the Titan's improved version rather than just pouring on the aggression.
</li><li> Another example is the Chaos Orb, a card which is tossed from a specified height onto the gaming table and destroys any card it ends up touching. It is now banned entirely from tournament play, but in the early days a story went around about some players came up with the clever idea of <em>tearing up the Chaos Orb card</em> and scattering all the pieces across the opponent's side of the table. This was eventually deemed illegal, but anyone with the cojones to pull a stunt like that with an extremely valuable out-of-print rare deserves to get the win.
<ul><li> This urban legend was referenced in a joke card as <a class="urllink" href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5712">Chaos Confetti<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> There are also the Planeswalkers, which often have a small ability that keeps them alive, and more powerful abilities that can often kill them or leave them near-death, and they can use only one per turn. Garruk Wildspeaker, in particular, gets this treatment: "Do I untap two lands or Overrun?" is a legitimate question.

<ul><li> The <em>Wish</em> spell (starting from Basic <em>D&amp;D</em>), and its divine counterpart <em>Miracle</em> (much later) can do almost <em>anything</em>. In a normal campaign, however high-level, <em>no-one</em> will <em>ever</em> cast them, unless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodzillaThreshold">suicidally desperate</a>. The cost and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">having to deal with possible twists</a> simply aren't worth it. First edition encourages the Dungeon Master to be as much of a jerkass literal genie as the wish wording allowed. Second and third edition restored some balance by adding "safe" uses of the spells, making them quite useful. For example, they can be used to imitate any other spell below certain levels, even granting access to spells that the character would otherwise never be able to cast. Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> in 5th Edition, where instead of an xp cost, there is a 33 percent chance every time you cast it of <em>never being able to cast it again</em>, meaning on average a caster will only be able to cast it 3 times in their entire life.
</li><li> Spellcasters are limited by the number of spells they can cast throughout the day. Some players tend to underuse their high level spells, holding back just in case they get into another combat before they can recharge.
</li><li> Magic items, including scrolls, potions and items with charges, are often underused by most players, particularly in campaigns that where magic items are particularly rare.
</li><li> 4th edition attempted to avert this trope:
<ul><li> Encounter powers are usable once per encounter, so it is a waste NOT to use them, as if they go unused you gain no benefit at all. Action points (which give you an extra action, though some characters can gain other uses for them) are restricted to being used once per encounter, you gain one every second encounter, and they reset after the adventure, encouraging players to use the resource. Sadly, many newbie players don't understand this and play this trope straight until it is explained to them; the optimal strategy tends to be to use all of your encounter powers straightaway, and to either use an action point in the encounter immediately prior to gaining another one (so the 2nd, 4th, ect.), as well against any sort of boss, or to save up for the first two fights, and then use an action point in the third, fourth, and fifth fights (assuming a standard 5-encounter adventure).
</li><li> Daily powers play this straight with many players as well; because they are usable only once per day (though they do reset), they tend to be saved for bosses. At low levels, you only have one, and thus often save it for the boss fight. At higher levels, you will have four daily powers, and possibly some daily utility powers as well, meaning that if you save them all for the final fight, even if you use them every single round in the fight, you still may not run out of them and will likely overwhelm the boss with insane firepower. Interestingly, many high-level monsters seem to be designed with the assumption that you'll drop a daily power in every fight, which is actually probably a good idea, because it helps you conserve healing surges for later in the adventure.
</li></ul></li><li> In 5th Edition, this can actually be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted Trope</a> if the DM and players are somewhat experienced and/or the DM gets "meta" with the players. Once the party gets past level 3 or so, a fully-rested party with all of their abilities can usually tear through an appropriate-level challenge if they're allowed to go all in on an enemy, so DMs that want a challenging final fight (without resorting to going way above the party level) may try to get PCs to use up some abilities by doing a fake-out of encounters left so PCs will use up some of their abilities before the fight or will make the fight initially seem easier than it is so the PCs can get lulled into complacency before the DM springs the trap. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedStraight">Played Straight</a> with Hit Dice though, as it is usually best for PCs to travel around near full health, but the rules only allowing 1/2 of max hit dice to be restored upon a rest can make players hesitant to heal fully during a Short Rest lest they have less resources for the following day.
</li><li> In all editions of <em>D&amp;D</em>, many limited-use magic items such as scrolls, potions, and wands may become this. Players save them, and then eventually realize that they have saved them so long they have become useless.
<ul><li> Interestingly, in 3rd edition D&amp;D, because almost all magic items can be bought or crafted pretty easily, this sometimes got reversed for cheap magical items; one of the most common accessories for experienced adventurers was the so-called healstick or curestick, a wand of cure light wounds which had 50 charges and thus could heal massive amounts of damage between fights at an extremely low cost. Once players got wealthy enough, they would start every fight at maximum hit points as a result, which lead to 4th edition allowing characters to simply heal for free between fights, and for limited-use healing items to heal using the same pool of healing as natural healing used, making them more of a convenience than anything else.
</li></ul></li><li> All editions of <em>D&amp;D</em> suffer from the "5 minute workday" issue to varying extents in order to subvert this trope; essentially, the players unload ALL of their best daily abilities up front, and then immediately go rest, so that they can spam them every single encounter. This was a much worse problem in earlier editions of <em>D&amp;D</em>, where there were many ways of hiding in a safe space under pretty ridiculous circumstances.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AvalonHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AvalonHill">Avalon Hill</a>'s <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ThirdReich" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ThirdReich">Third Reich</a></em> (both the table-top and computer versions) has elements of this:
<ul><li> The double move: With a little judicious spending, it's possible to move twice in a row, which can be a huge advantage. The only problem? It tends to set up the other side to do the same exact thing, so most players will never use it unless they can be pretty certain of knocking a major enemy country out of the war.
</li><li> American units: These are the best Allied units in the game, but they have a drawback. American units that get eliminated have to be rebuilt in the United States and then initially deployed to Britain (or France, in the unlikely event that France is still standing), but the United States can only initially deploy six units per turn, and those units cannot be strategically redeployed to any place outside of Britain until the next turn. So there's a temptation for the Allies to let the British carry the brunt of the fighting, since any British casualties can return to the front a turn earlier than any American casualties.
</li><li> French and British units in the Mediterranean theater: This is the same principle as the previous point. British units are generally stronger than French units, but British units require two nine-factor fleets to be transported to the Mediterranean front, whereas French units require only one (assuming the French navy has been based in Marseilles). So if the war in North Africa heats up while France is still standing (granted, it usually doesn't), there is a temptation for the Allies to let the French to bear the brunt of the fighting there.
</li></ul></li><li> Magic items in the earliest edition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/TheDarkEye">The Dark Eye</a></em> could easily end up being this, since with the single exception of the eponymous "dark eye" <em>all</em> example items listed in the rulebook, from the obligatory healing potion over a belt that would temporarily boost a character's strength to a key that could open any lock, were single-use only. (The dark eye itself was limited in a different fashion — it was a crystal ball magically tied to the site of its creation, so even if you ever found one you couldn't take it with you.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> Several armies, most notably the Dark Eldar and Inquisitors of the Grey Knights faction, have weapons or items which are "one use" or "One Shot". They usually have a disproportionally high power compared to a reusable weapon/item of similar effect (such as a weapon that can simply <em>negate something's existence</em> as opposed to a really good, but still avoidable anti-tank weapon). However their one use means that you have to pick and choose your moments and, on top of that, because of the dice-based nature of the game you run the risk of having it <em>not do anything at all</em>. Certain items are also force multipliers, meaning you'll be trying to squeeze all your troops into it's area of effect before setting it off, but this runs the risk of squeezing your army into one neat and tidy ball for your opponent's massive weapon.
</li><li> Averted in the case of combi-weapons. Popular wisdom is to send a squad loaded with combi-weapons on a suicide drop to eliminate a big threat, fire the one-shot mode immediately, and not to worry about the inevitable retaliation.
</li><li> In-universe, the Custodes for the Imperium. They are bar none the mightiest warriors in the Imperium, even stronger than the Space Marines. However, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BioAugmentation">Bio-Augmentation</a> process used to create Custodes is so taxing that each Custodes is a huge investment for the Imperium. As a result, the Imperium can't risk losing a single one for any reason save defending the Golden Throne itself.
</li><li> In-universe, Imperial Titans take centuries to construct, due to the veneration given to them by the Adeptus Mechanicus (The revered Emperor-Class Titan is implied to take a millenium or two to actually make, or sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a> outright). As a result, even though a single titan can turn the tide of battle in the Imperium's favour, they're seldom used outside of defending their Forge World homes, so the act of deploying even a single Titan Maniple (which consist of only three titans) is considered a Godzilla threshold just under that of Exterminatus. This also means that the Imperium will go to absurd lengths to recover even parts of a Titan, as repairing one is far quicker than building a new one. The only aversion to this are Imperial Knights, who are specifically created as cheap, mass produced versions of Titans for use in "small" scale engagements.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer">Warhammer</a></em>
<ul><li> A good number of one-use-per-game magic items that a player must carefully choose the right time to use. Frequently these will end up going unused in the hands of a cautious player, who is saving them for a later that never comes, just in case. Perhaps the most common such item in the 8th edition of the game is the Dispel Magic Scroll - a scroll which automatically dispels an enemy spell and stops it from working before it is cast. In previous editions of the game the <em>Dispel Magic</em> Scroll was ubiquitous — pretty much the only magic item that could be duplicated. This led to many players loading down their wizards with as many of the things as they could cram in, then using them liberally, to severely curtail the enemy's magic phase. This was rarely fun, especially if both sides were doing it, so in 8th edition the Dispel Magic Scroll has become a one-per-army item like everything else. Now that it represents your army's one chance to automatically counter a key enemy spell (other dispel attempts require the rolling of dice, and can fail) it has become a precious resource indeed. So precious that they frequently go unused nowadays.
</li><li> There's also an abundance of arcane items similar to the dispel scroll that either expands upon it's functions (such as dispelling all magic that phase) or does something equally effective to the enemy wizards that effectively shut them down for one turn. They're usually done so in such a way that they cost much higher than what the dispel scroll would be worth, even if the effect was technically worse; this is because the writers know that the simple fact that these item exist would unbalance the game, after all it no longer becomes a question of "which one to use" (as is the case with Magic Weapons and Armor) but rather "how many can I cram into my list". And indeed every such item is squeezed in alongside the dispel scroll whenever possible; even sometimes at the expense of actual troops. But since they too are one-use only, they seldom see use unless the perfect opportunity comes along. The most notable example is the Hellheart, which can nuke several enemy wizards in a large radius, but the owner would try to maneuver the holder into such a position, while the enemy (as they would be allowed to know if a Hellheart was taken and who has it) would try to lead him on a merry chase, invoking this trope so that he might not loose even a single caster to it.
</li></ul></li><li> Fellow <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GamesWorkshop">Games Workshop</a></em> game, Chainsaw Warrior has the Laser Lance. This weapon is the most important item in the game, he'll always start with this (in contrast everything else he has is random, even his chainsaw might not appear). It's the one weapon that NO ENEMY is immune to and in the iOS game sequel - the Laser Lance has an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercing">Armor Piercing</a> capability that rivals a multi-rocket M-T-M Rocket launcher and the massive Bartlett X600 Sniper Rifle. However few people use the Laser Lance unless it's a real emergency or they're fighting the last boss, the Darkness. The kicker? The Laser Lance has mediocre accuracy and only 3 shots. The Darkness can only be killed by two weapons, the Laser Lance and the Implosion Vest which also kills the wearer, making the Laser Lance the only safe choice.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope">Defied</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera">Numenera</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedUseMagicalDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedUseMagicalDevice">Limited-Use Magical Devices</a> called cyphers are found all over the place, but PCs are only able to carry two or three or a time safely. So regardless of how awesome a given cypher is, the system encourages you to burn them and grab new ones after every encounter.
</li><li> Destiny points and, to a lesser extent, Force points in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/StarWarsSagaEdition">Star Wars: Saga Edition</a></em>:
<ul><li> Destiny points are extremely powerful character attributes: they can be spent to make any attack an automatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHit">Critical Hit</a> or any enemy attack an automatic miss (even after the dice have already been rolled and the results announced); they allow your character to act out of turn or take damage; and they can be converted to three less-powerful, but still useful Force Points. The downside? You only get one at each level up, with no way to obtain more. Due to their extreme power, players tend to stockpile them and not spend them unless the situation is truly desperate. Some GMs houserule a hard cap on how many destiny points a character can have at one time in an attempt to avoid this (and to prevent the players from taking out the campaign's final boss by using destiny points to score 5 critical hits before said boss can even act).
</li><li> Force points allow a character to activate some special abilities, add 1d6 to nearly any d20 roll, and turn a fatal blow into a merely incapacitating one. That last one ensures that players always keep at least one on hand at all times. Because Force Points only regenerate at each level up, players usually stockpile a couple for emergencies and refuse to spend them until they're close to levelling up. An alternate, optional rule sees players get a far lower number of Force points (one for Levels 1-6, two for levels 7-12, and three for levels 13+) but have them regenerate daily. Though the game suggests using this rule for a campaign that uses Force points more frequently, the end result often sees <em>less</em> Force point usage, to the point where players under level 7 frequently won't use any Force Points at all, lest they be caught without one when a strong attack drops them to 0 HP.

The same thing happens to the main character when he has experimental bullets designed to be used against specific types of allomancers; he doesn't shoot at enemies because he doesn't want to use the bullets against the wrong person.

</li><li> The Dutch version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMole">The Mole</a></em> introduced "jokers" in the later seasons that players can use to nullify incorrect answers on the test that determines which one of them will be executed, and they typically can hoard them to use on future tests when the margin of error is smaller. Many contestants have ended up executed when they still had a joker or two (or three or even <em>four!</em>) in their pockets because they either thought they were safe and didn't need them or wanted to save the jokers for when they'd <em>really</em> need them.

The Borg were so awesomely powerful (and impossible to negotiate with) that they only got used four times (6 episodes, because of 2-parters) over the entire 7 seasons of the show. It was just that hard to come up with a way to defeat the Borg without making them seem less awesome. Of those 4 times they face the Borg, they are saved once by essentially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">Divine Intervention</a>, and once they are merely facing an individual drone and the challenge is to make him an individual (plus attempting not to tangle with the Borg ship coming for the rescue), not to defeat him.

Team CFVY help the heroes fight to save the city, but team-leader Coco refuses to allow Velvet use her weapon. Her weapon consists of a box she carries at her waist but which she almost never uses. Coco states that she's spent all semester working on it and it would be a waste to use it now. The heroes handily defeat the invasion and save the city, but a far more extensive and devastating invasion happens a year later at the end of Volume 3. This time, Coco calls on Velvet to use her weapon. The box is revealed to be a holographic projector that produces weapons made from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a>. Velvet's Semblance allows her to perfectly mimic the fighting style and moves of any warrior she's ever seen. Her weapon therefore creates holographic weapons of every weapon she's ever photographed. By using the correct weapon in combination with her Semblance, Velvet becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a>. The weakness of the weapon is that she can only use each weapon a single time and only for a short period of time, so a single battle could use up her entire supply of photographs and leave her with nothing. Once it's used up, she has to rebuild the holographic projector with a new stock of photographs. As a result, she has to be very careful about when she makes use of her weapon and even which photographs she chooses to use.

<ul><li> Shortly before World War I, Britain and Germany began bulking up their navy fleet with a new class of powerful battleships called "Dreadnoughts". By the time the war started, both sides had dozens of them. However, the Dreadnoughts were so valuable that neither side was willing to risk them by putting them out to sea. Both sides mainly used them as a deterrent against the other, using their mere presence as a way to keep the other side from risking theirs. Only once during the entire war did Dreadnoughts fight each other, at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. No Dreadnought from either side was sunk by enemy cannon fire or torpedoes during the entire war, though one of them, the <em>HMS Audacious</em>, was sunk by a mine in 1914.

They were finally mobilized for the Battle of Samar. The Musashi never even saw the enemy, being ambushed and destroyed by airplanes in the Sibuyan Sea, the Yamato and its fleet of battleships engaged what was supposed to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">group of destroyers and carriers</a> before being forced to retreat by the air support.

However, the <em>Bismarck</em> did not survive her maiden voyage, demonstrating that the class was neither unsinkable nor invincible. They did, of course, remain insanely expensive and the loss of the <em>Bismarck</em> was a huge blow. Exacerbated by the destruction of the only dry-dock big enough to take her, it simply became too risky to put the only surviving <em>Bismarck</em>-class ship in harm's way and she spent most of the rest of war uselessly patrolling the Norwegian fjords.
</li><li> When Germany invaded the Soviet Union on 22 June, 1941, the Red Army had 967 T-34 tanks. This was a brand new model with firepower, mobility, and protection superior to anything the Germans had at the time, and it was eventually supposed to replace the Red Army's vast numbers of obsolete BT and T-26 tanks. The problem was that the T-34 had severe teething troubles, with the design and manufacture of its components starting out highly flawed. Transmissions broke very frequently, and the engine would fail after just one hundred hours of operation. The military was afraid to let tankers practice driving them because if they were operated they would break, and then they wouldnt be ready in case of a war. Therefore they only allowed fifty T-34s to be operated, while the rest were kept parked in the motor pools. This led to a double problem during Barbarossa, since the tanks were unreliable, and the guys crewing them were unfamiliar with their use.
</li><li> The interwar-designed United States Mark 14 Torpedo had multiple crippling design flaws with the guidance and detonation systems, which were not discovered because they were so expensive and being produced so slowly that the higher-ups were unwilling to destroy any through realistic tests. The uselessness of the unproven torpedoes was discovered at the worst possible time, in combat with the Japanese Navy.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RareMoney">Rare coins and dollar bills</a>:
<ul><li> The 2-dollar bill. Some people give them as gifts, knowing that the recipient will keep it for this reason. Even though they are rare in circulation, they aren't actually rare at all. The U.S. Treasury has been sitting on shrink-wrapped piles of them for years, but banks rarely ask for them. Strip clubs, on the other hand, love to use them to make change as it encourages bigger tips.
</li><li> On the other end of the scale are $50 and $100 dollar bills, to the point where most shops refuse to accept them. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">there is a good reason for this</a>: the bills are worth so much that if a cashier were to attempt to make change for a $100 bill, it is likely that they would run out of lesser bills, so that the store cannot make any more change for the rest of the day. Also, larger bills like that are the main target of counterfeiters, as they obviously are more worth the effort.
</li><li> To hard-core numismatists<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10lu36');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10lu36" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10lu36');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">not just a coin collector, an overall currency geek</span>, Sacagawea and Eisenhower dollars are no different than the change we have in our pockets. However, there are other dollar coins made from precious metals that you would be an idiot to spend at face-value. A $3 gold coin (yes, they really exist) minted in 1854 and in near perfect condition (MS-67) is worth at least $95,000. A Flowing Hair Half Dollar minted in 1794 in MS-64 condition is worth over $450,000. There are even platinum coins out there. A platinum Eagle ($10) minted in 2000 is worth $7500 in perfect (MS-70) condition. But then, bullion coins like that aren't meant to ever be spent at their nominal face value. An ounce of platinum, no matter the condition, is worth upward of $1000.
</li><li> This also goes for the Japanese ¥2000 note. Just having one is a conversation point, and no one ever spends them if they can avoid it.
</li><li> The same mentioned for the $50 and $100 dollar bills happens for 100, 200, and 500 notes. Quite a number of shops do not accept them, since they'd run out of change and especially the two last ones are so much money that is very hard to find them<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note112fti');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note112fti" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note112fti');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Because of that in Spain at least, the 500 bills were nicknamed "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Bin Laden</a>"</span>. Also, the European Central Bank has announced that the 500 note will be phased out as it is frequently used for money laundering.
</li><li> The British £5, £10 and £20 coins.
</li><li> The Canadian one and two dollar bills are still technically legal tender, even though they were replaced by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">loonies and toonies</a> (one- and two-dollar coins) over twenty years ago since they are cheaper to keep in circulation because they stay in good condition for decades longer than paper banknotes. The bills are now kept by people old enough to have used them when they were still in circulation. Collector's coins, put out every year or so, are also carefully hoarded.
</li><li> Some Israeli coins have on their reverse side the picture of the person who used to be on the corresponding bill before it was devalued. Many of them are relatively easy to find, but the one Shekel coin with Maimonides has effectively disappeared from circulation years ago.
</li><li> During the transition from paper to plastic 5 and 10 pound notes, new notes with certain serial numbers became extremely collectible and worth far more than their face value, making them basically unspendable. Serial numbers of special interest included ones that began with AA and ones that began with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AKA47">AK47</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Nuclear weapons are insanely powerful, but practically the only justification for using a nuclear weapon is someone else using one first. Thankfully, this still remains a valid trope in this context, though then again, once it's invalidated there probably wouldn't be anyone left to read <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TVTropes">TV Tropes</a>...
</li><li> Food, bizarrely enough. Rare or prized foods such as expensive cuts of meat, ingredients like truffles, caviar, or saffron, all get saved for special events. The problem with this is most foods have an expiry date, so sitting on them until the perfect occasion can result in a great deal of wasted food. This can also apply on a lesser scale to things like leftovers, where one waits until one needs them to eat them, by which point they've usually gone bad. Rare and aged wines tend to fall into this category as well.
</li><li> Onegative blood. It's the universal donor, meaning anyone of any blood type can take O- blood and have it work. But <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">someone with O- blood can't take anything except O- blood</a>, so hospitals rarely use donated O- blood in case an O patient comes in and needs a transfusion or an emergency when there is no time to determine blood type.
</li><li> Sports cars, especially higher-end ones, can fall into this easily, as using them gradually wears them down over long-term use thus reducing the resale value (just like any other car) and they're an attractive target for car thieves and vandals when they're out in public. Also, getting one of these in an accident will be an insurance and repair cost nightmare compared to getting an ordinary coupe or minivan in one (still bad, but at least they're cheaper to fix and replacement parts for them are more common). As a result, these types of cars end up being status symbols for a number of owners rather than everyday driving machines (on top of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">being fuel-inefficient and speed limits preventing them from being used to their full potential unless one takes them to a closed racetrack</a>).
</li><li> Within <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AussiesWithArtillery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AussiesWithArtillery">the Australian Military</a>, the Armored Corps (which are equipped with expensive M1-Abrams tanks) are jokingly called "Koalas." The joke is that Koalas are valuable, but useless in the long run because they can't be exported or shot at.
</li><li> High-powered pain killers, such as morphine. Yes, they are really good at stopping pain and feel good as well, but can't just be used whenever the patient wants, as there is risk of addiction, as well as causing constipation and other digestive problems.
