</div></div><p>You are a grown adult. You've found your true love, and they love you back. You want to get married. Everything's great, right? Wrong! Your parents are convinced that you've picked the wrong person, and will do almost anything to prevent the marriage.

Your parents don't want the right to pick your spouse. They just want to veto your choice. In some societies, your parents may have a legal right to such a veto.

<ul><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Planetes">Planetes</a></em> inverts this when it turns out that Edel had to stay away from her husband for five years to prevent her parents from vetoing their divorce.
</li><li> Happens more than once on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaisonIkkoku">Maison Ikkoku</a></em>. One is in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a>, where Kyoko's parents objected to her marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotForTeacher">her former teacher Soichiro</a>; another is at the end, where Kyoko's father again objects <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to Godai's impending proposal.

</li><li> In the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Gundam">Gundam</a> series, Garma Zabi believes that his father will try and pull this trope on him and becomes desperate to find a way to force him to accept. Possibly subverted, as Garma was Degwin's favored son and it's doubtful the old man could have refused him anything.
<ul><li> It's then played straight in the case of Iserina Eschenbach, Garma's sweetheart. <em>Her</em> father was a rabid Zeon hater, after all.

They disapprove of him partly because of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">their age difference</a>, but mostly because he wasn't rich like them, thus either feared he was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> or disliked his lower social class. Years later, Sonomi still hates Fujitaka - although in Sonomi's case, it's less that he's older and poorer and more that he took her beloved cousin away from her.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> A whole episode of the anime is dedicated to actually fixing this, with Nadeshiko's grandfather Masaaki apologizing to Fujitaka for the Amamiya family's shabby treatment of him.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiShiteNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AiShiteNight">Ai Shite Night</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverprotectiveDad">Overprotective Dad</a> Shige forbids his daughter Yakko from marrying her rock-star boyfriend Go when they ponder getting married as soon as he returns from the USA.

</li><li> Brutally used in a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> case in which the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> father of a rich girl not only forbids his daughter from marrying her pianist boyfriend, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinGore">stomps on the pianist's hand and breaks it</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CareerEndingInjury">which ruins his career.</a> The poor piano man commits suicide and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenBird">Broken Bird</a> daughter runs away. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButlerDidIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheButlerDidIt">And the new family butler, who was the pianist's dad, kills the old man</a>.</span>

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FinalApproach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FinalApproach">Final Approach</a></em> Ryo learns late in the show that this is why his fiancee was given to him at the start of the story. His grandmother and her grandfather were once in love, but were torn apart by her grandfather's family for being from a poor family. He relented to his family's wish and married another woman. It turns out the entire setup for the series is her grandfather using his tremendous wealth to create a situation where his granddaughter can marry the grandson of the woman he lost to Parental Marriage Veto.
</li><li> When Anasui asks Jotaro for permission to marry Jolyne near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JoJosBizarreAdventureStoneOcean">Jo Jos Bizarre Adventure Stone Ocean</a></em>, Jotaro asks him if he's insane and completely refuses to justify the request with an answer. Then Anasui asks again, and he responds by snatching his daughter away from him. Perhaps Anasui would have had more luck if he popped the question when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the world wasn't about to end</span> — and if he wasn't a bit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a>.
</li><li> Two in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SandChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SandChronicles">Sand Chronicles</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ann's maternal grandma Misayo didn't approve of the marriage of Ann's parents Miwako and Masahiro as it also meant moving from Miwako's home village to Tokyo, but she couldn't stop them. She still doesn't like Masahiro when he sees her again post-Miwako-death.
</li><li> Fuji's mother is against his intention to marry <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his cousin Mariko</span> due to their prestige as well as the unfortunate implications she thinks it'll bring, which is why she wants to get him into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> with someone more appropriate. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Volume 10 shows that his parents finally gave in and the final chapter gives a glimpse of their wedding.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Strips </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This was one of the early plots in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Blondie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Blondie">Blondie</a></em>. Before they were married, Dagwood's wealthy parents disapproved of Blondie, feeling she was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> (and initially, she was), and tried to get him to marry a woman of their social class. They finally gave in and allowed Dagwood to marry Blondie after he went on a 30-day hunger strike, but warned him that if he married her, they would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassedOverInheritance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PassedOverInheritance">disown him.</a> They went ahead with the wedding, and the rest is comic strip history.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Persepolis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Persepolis">Persepolis</a></em>. While Marjane's mother doesn't approve of her engagement, her father overrules any vetos on the conditions that her husband-to-be lives outside of Iran with her and agrees to let her divorce, should it come to that. He agrees, and the two are married. Eventually the two become unhappy and get divorced, at which point Marjane's father reveals that he suspected as much, but also knew that flat-out forbidding the marriage would only make the couple more determined to defy him. To keep things as smooth as possible, he just made sure Marjane had an easy out when things inevitably went badly. (Her mother, upon hearing this, is annoyed that he didn't just let her in on the plan so she wouldn't have worried so much.)

<ul><li> There's an old joke based on this:
<div class="indent">One Sunday morning William burst into the living room and said, "Dad! Mom! I have some great news for you! I am getting married to the most beautiful girl in town. She lives a block away and her name is Susan."
</div><div class="indent">After dinner, William's dad took him aside. "Son, I have to talk with you. Your mother and I have been married 30 years. She's a wonderful wife but she has never offered much excitement in the bedroom, so I used to fool around with women a lot. Susan is actually your half-sister, and I'm afraid you can't marry her."
</div><div class="indent">William was heartbroken. After eight months he eventually started dating girls again. A year later he came home and very proudly announced, "Dianne said yes! We're getting married in June."
</div><div class="indent">Again his father insisted on another private conversation and broke the sad news. "Dianne is your half-sister too, William. I'm awfully sorry about this."
</div><div class="indent">William was furious! He finally decided to go to his mother with the news.
</div><div class="indent">"Dad has done so much harm. I guess I'm never going to get married," he complained. "Every time I fall in love, Dad tells me the girl is my half-sister."
</div><div class="indent">His mother just shook her head. "Don't pay any attention to what he says, dear. He's not really your father."
</div><ul><li> There are a couple songs based on this joke, see the Music section.

<ul><li> Many of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyTrollope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnthonyTrollope">Anthony Trollope</a>'s novels contain this trope.
<ul><li> In <em>Doctor Thorne</em>, Frank Gresham's parents don't want him to wed Mary Thorne, who is illegitimate and poor. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">illegitimate and rich is fine</span>.
</li><li> In <em>Framley Parsonage</em>, Lady Lufton doesn't want her son to marry Lucy Robarts, whose brother has become involved in someone else's financial scandal. But mainly because she doesn't think Lucy's is 'significant' enough (character-wise) to be the wife of such an important man.
</li><li> In <em>The Last Chronicle of Barset</em>, Major Grantly wants to marry Grace Crawley. The Major's father is appalled at this, because Grace's father has been accused of forgery and theft.
</li><li> In <em>The Duke's Children</em>, the last of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Palliser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Palliser">Palliser</a></em> novels, the Duke of Omnium is trying to stop two marriages. His daughter wants to marry a poor man. His eldest son wants to marry an American.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWayWeLiveNow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWayWeLiveNow">The Way We Live Now</a></em>, Lady Carbury is trying to prevent her daughter from marrying Paul Montague, who is apparently already engaged to an American widow.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s Middle-Earth:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, Thingol doesn't want his daughter Lúthien to marry the mortal Beren. While he doesn't know at the time that that would eventually result in her choosing to become mortal, he had premonitions of Doom around the whole matter. So he set Beren an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EngagementChallenge">impossible task</a> to get rid of him (breaking into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell">Angband</a> and stealing a Silmaril), no doubt hoping he'd give up or die, which of course completely backfired in horrible ways for generations to come. (Don't mess with the Silmarils. Seriously.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, when Elrond (Beren and Lúthien's immortal great-grandson) finds out that his daughter Arwen and his mortal adopted/foster son Aragorn are in love, he sets down what seems to be a impossible set of restrictions on their marriage: Sauron must be vanquished, Aragorn must unite the ancient kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor <em>and</em> become High King over them. This puts a great deal of stress on Elrond and Aragorn's relationship, but when Aragorn helps fulfill every single one of these conditions, Elrond allows the marriage to happen and Love Conquers All. Those nearly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossibleTask">impossible tasks</a> had the bonus effect of ensuring Middle-Earth would at least theoretically be habitable for them and their descendants.

<ul><li> Anne Boleyn furiously <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> banishes her sister Mary from court when Mary admits that she has secretly married William Stafford and is carrying his child.</span> Although not technically her mother, since Anne was Queen at the time, she could be considered a de facto guardian.
</li><li> A more straightforward example comes earlier in the book, when Anne <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> secretly marries Henry Percy</span>. The marriage is annulled by Cardinal Wolsey, and Anne is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> banished from court by her family as punishment</span>, while Henry Percy is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> forced into marriage to a woman closer to his social standing</span>. It is implied that this early loss is what drives Anne to be as cold and ambitious as she is for the remainder of the book, and that she never is quite over it.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a> used this trope quite a bit:
<ul><li> The A-plot of <em>every</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlandingsCastle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BlandingsCastle">Blandings Castle</a></em> book by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PGWodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a>, to the point where Wodehouse himself had his own names for all the character tropes involved. The "parent" was always one of his governess sisters, and the resolution almost invariably ended with the Hon. Galahad Threepwood (or sometimes Uncle Fred) blackmailing said sister into letting the marriage through, generally using an element of the B-plot.
</li><li> The trope tended to turn up regularly in Wodehouse's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JeevesAndWooster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JeevesAndWooster">Jeeves and Wooster</a> stories. There was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> in at least one book where a writer character said something like, "He forbids the marriage? I couldn't use that in a story nowadays!"
</li><li> <em>A Damsel in Distress</em> starts off this way, with Maud Marsh, the daughter of the Earl of Marshmorton, in love with a thoroughly unsuitable (American and not rich) young man she met on a ship voyage. The family has absolutely put their foot down, and forbidden her to even leave the house until she "comes to her senses" and chooses a more suitable mate. It turns out that this technique was actually successful with her father, back in the day.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RomanceOfTheThreeKingdoms">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a></em>, the Dowager Marchioness (basically "queen mother") of the Sun family subverts this trope by blessing the marriage of her daughter to Liu Bei, then upbraiding her son Sun Quan and his right-hand man Zhou Yu (son-in-law of the State Patriarch who also supports the marriage) for plotting to <em>kill</em> the groom, since after word got out it would make her daughter unweddable (in a "what man would want her now?" kind of way).
</li><li> Anne Brontë's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgnesGrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AgnesGrey">Agnes Grey</a></em> uses this as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory">Backstory</a> and a running plot thread: when Agnes' mother chose to marry a poor parson, she was disowned by her father (despite annual visits with her daughters to her childhood home, they never even <em>saw</em> him); after Mr. Grey's death, she receives a letter from her father telling her she can come back and her daughters will be heiresses if she will just say that she regrets marrying. All three Grey women (she would have done it had her daughters wanted the money) tell him to go to hell.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LittleWomen">Little Women</a></em>, Aunt March tries to do this to Meg when she wants to marry John Brooke, a poor Englishman and Laurie's tutor, mistakenly believing that he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> who wants to use her to get Aunt March's riches. It backfires, rousing Meg's anger and turning her reluctant 'no' into a defiant 'yes.'
<ul><li> In <em>Jo's Boys</em>, Meg won't let her daughter Daisy marry Nat because — besides his being an ex-homeless nobody — Meg (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidowWoman">Widow Woman</a> by this point) doesn't think the sensitive, very young and inexpert musician will be able to man up and provide for Daisy. However, when he returns to the States after two years' European study <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagsToRiches">as an established violinist with a steady income and excellent future prospects</a>, Meg relents. (The beard he grows in the meanwhile helps.)
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JaneAusten">Jane Austen</a> really loved this trope. Of course, it was the law of the land in her day, unless you escaped to Scotland.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>, Mr. Darcy's aunt Catherine attempts to veto the marriage... which ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobFixingItVillain">helping to bring it about</a>, since at the time that Lady Catherine declares her veto, Elizabeth and Darcy are each separately convinced that the other no longer wants anything to do with them. Hearing that Elizabeth has refused to promise not to marry him is what gives Mr. Darcy enough hope to try proposing to her again, with rather better results than his first attempt.
</li><li> The lovers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SenseAndSensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NorthangerAbbey">Northanger Abbey</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Persuasion">Persuasion</a></em> also face this.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneStrattonPorter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeneStrattonPorter">Gene Stratton-Porter</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Freckles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Freckles">Freckles</a></em>, McLean tells Angel she can't confess her love to Freckles for fear of her father's disapproval. She assures him afterwards that Freckles would not take her even with her father's consent, owing to his fear of disgracing her.
</li><li> Somewhat subverted in Anne Fine's <em>Fly in the Ointment</em>. The parents disapprove of the match and upset/insult their daughter by not coming to the wedding. The father is a petty tyrant who the daughter is glad to ignore. However, she soon concludes that they were right to dislike her husband and if they had not upset her so much by missing the wedding she soon would have run home to them.
</li><li> In the second <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ApprenticeAdept">Apprentice Adept</a></em> trilogy: Stile and Lady Blue object to Bane (or rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">his Photon doppelgänger, Mach in Bane's body</a>) marrying Fleta the unicorn. Not for any species hangups but because Fleta wouldn't be able to provide an heir to the title of Blue Adept. Since this was a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog">Reason Before Honor</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PiersAnthony">Piers Anthony</a> work, this bites the good guys hard in the ass later. Conversely, Stile and Lady Blue's Proton counterparts, Blue and Sheen, had no problem with Bane-in-Mach's-body being an item with the alien Agape. Since Mach was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobot">Ridiculously Human Robot</a>, producing heirs were never an issue.
</li><li> Sorta used in Andersen's <em>The Shepherdess and the Chimney-Sweep</em>. The Chinaman isn't the Shepherdess' father for obvious reasons (they're porcelain figurines), but he still wants her to "marry" the mahogany satyr instead of the chimneysweep she fancies.
</li><li> A fact of life in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FunnyBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FunnyBoy">Funny Boy</a></em>. One character was completely cut off from her family for marrying outside her ethnic group. Radha's parents and siblings definitely act as though this power is a given, and although Radha is willing to defy them, this is a very serious decision.
</li><li> Elsie Dinsmore's father vetoes <em>two</em> proposals. The first is from a sickly childhood friend; Horace is afraid he won't reach twenty-one (and he doesn't). The second is from a con man after her inheritance. Elsie honors her father's wishes both times and ends up marrying the man who exposed the second candidate as a drunk and gambler.

<ul><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie">Agatha Christie</a> example comes from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MissMarple">Miss Marple</a> novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APocketFullOfRye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/APocketFullOfRye">A Pocket Full of Rye</a>.</em> Rex Fortescue threatens to cut off his daughter Elaine without a cent if she marries the Communist Gerald Wright. Elaine would have married him anyway, but Gerald was only interested in Elaine for her money and promptly dumped her. At least until Rex died, leaving Elaine a large amount of money... Interestingly, Miss Marple is convinced the marriage will turn out well, as she sees the gold-hunting groom as a man who will respect and be kind to the woman who made his dreams (a school) come true where he's resent a poor girl married for love for ruining his life.

Not, whatever those outside the family say, because the Bad Boy was losing interest.
</li><li> Twisted around in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ABrothersPrice">A Brother's Price</a></em>. Males in this world are rare, so a family lucky enough to have a son will either trade him for another family's son - men marry every sister in a family - or sell him. Jerin is approaching the age of marriage and is anxious, because he might be traded for the son of the huge, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentChildIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentChildIncest">possibly-incestuous</a> Brindle family. He reflects that if it were up to his mothers, they wouldn't want him to be unhappy, but in these cases the decision is up to the sisters who are looking to marry someone, and some of his sisters are interested in the Brindle son. His sisters <em>don't</em> approve of his falling in love with Princess Ren, since in their eyes she tried to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuestionableConsent">rape</a> Jerin.
<ul><li> That said, while mothers have little to do with the decision-making process on Jerin's side, Ren still has to get permission from her Mother Eldest to marry Jerin, because she <em>is</em> a princess and the Prince Consort must have good genes and a good history for the sake of the realm.

When Anne informs the father of the elopement, he takes the news with deep relief and satisfaction - he'd wanted the two to marry all along and issued his veto on the accurate assumption that the boy would be much more interested in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForbiddenFruit">Forbidden Fruit</a> than in having a girl pushed at him, but had feared that his daughter would end up being too spineless to go through with it.

</li><li> There are <em>three</em> plot lines in Michelle Magorian's <em>A Little Love Song</em> (which is set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">1943</a>), and they all deconstruct this trope in one way or another:
<ul><li> The first one happens in the book's present day, where seventeen-year-old Dot has been kicked out by her parents for getting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenPregnancy">pregnant out of wedlock</a> and is facing the stigma of becoming an unwed mother. Dot states that if her stubborn father had just let her marry her childhood sweetheart Jack when they had asked for his permission, this never would've happened.
</li><li> The second one happens about 26 years earlier and is told through a diary that the main character Rose finds. The diary belongs to a woman named Hilda, and tells the story of how she was a volunteer nurse during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">the First World War</a> and fell in love with one of her patients, Matthew. Hilda's family refused to let them get married, partly because Matthew was six years younger than her and worked at a publishing company while Hilda herself was firmly upper-class, but mostly because her parents and brothers had decided that as the only daughter, she would remain unmarried and stay at home and take care of her parents until they died.
</li><li> The third one is just a short conversation during which Rose expresses concern that their mother might not let Rose's sister Diana marry Robert because he's from a lower class. Diana just states that if their mother won't give her permission, she will just marry him anyway, and that she's pretty happy that he's from a different class because if she married someone from their own class she would just end up being a decoration at a dinner table, while Robert actually treats her like a person.

<ul><li> Many gay and bisexual people risk getting disowned by getting married, if they can even legally get married. Also, if they belong to an organized religion that is against same-sex marriage, they may end up being excommunicated and excluded from certain aspects of involvement with church activities if they dare to marry someone of the same gender as themselves, which can be just as depressing as having one's parents reject them for their marriage.
</li><li> Beatrix Potter got engaged to the publisher of her storybooks. Her parents objected because he was a tradesman but eventually relented, if she would wait out the summer to make sure her love for him was real. Unfortunately, he died before summer's end and the wedding never happened.

</li><li> Peculiar example because it's based partially around an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a>: a Jewish rabbi has set up a system in which Jewish children (on a voluntary basis) are tested to see if they're carriers of the Tay-Sachs disease allele. For background, Tay-Sachs is a Mendelian recessive trait (more or less...) and the disease that can kill by age two (life expectancy for the condition in general is about four) should a child receive two copies of the gene, but a child who receives only one copy will be healthy; thus a child of two carriers has an alarmingly high 25% chance of having the disease. This trait is particularly prominent among Ashkenazi Jews. Understandably concerned about the health issue but also cultural sensitivities (among them a desire to see Jews continue to marry Jews), the rabbi started this project; the children are not told the results of the test, but are given a number. In later life, should their families be contemplating a match between two people who have been tested, they just send the numbers in and are advised to drop the match if both of them are carriers... a rare <em>genetic</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalMarriageVeto">Parental Marriage Veto</a>.
</li><li> Then there are of course the royal families:
<ul><li> King George III vetoed quite a few of his sons' potential marriages, mostly because they wanted to marry either commoners or Catholics, which led to a succession crisis after the death of Princess Charlotte (the daughter and heir of George IV) in childbirth. George IV was succeeded by his younger brother, William IV, who was then succeeded by his niece <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/QueenVictoria">Victoria</a>, the daughter of his brother Prince Edward. Meanwhile, his wife, Queen Charlotte, forestalled any attempts to marry off her younger daughters to keep them as her companions, with the result that two daughters married later in life (48 and 40) and two never married at all.
</li><li> King George VI initially vetoed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HMTheQueen">then-Princess Elizabeth's</a> marriage to Philip Mountbatten, mostly because she was underage and he was still largely seen by the public as a Greek and Danish prince, even though he had given up those titles. After World War II, when Philip was a British war hero and Elizabeth had turned 21, her father finally consented to the marriage.
</li><li> Elizabeth herself vetoed Prince Charles' potential marriage to Camilla Shand because of her somewhat scandalous dating history and the belief that Charles needed to marry a young English virgin. Camilla married Andrew Parker-Bowles, Charles married Lady Diana Spencer, and the rest, as they say, is history.
</li><li> For the longest time, the sovereign of Great Britain had veto rights over the marriages of <em>anyone</em> in the succession who could claim descent from George II. If they married without permission anyway, they'd lose their place in the succession. This was eventually repealed (but not until <em>2013</em>!), and the current law only limits the sovereign's veto rights to the first six people in the line of succession.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note022kw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note022kw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note022kw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Current list: Prince Charles (married to Camilla after Diana's death, with the Queen's blessing), Prince William (also married with the Queen's approval), Prince George (born in 2013), Princess Charlotte (born in 2015), Prince Louis (born in 2018), and Prince Harry (also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeghanMarkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeghanMarkle">married</a> with the Queen's approval).</span>
</li><li> King Olav V of Norway initially vetoed Crown Prince Harald's engagement to Sonja Haraldsen because she was a Norwegian commoner and Olav wanted his son to marry a princess. Harald responded to this by informing his father that if he couldn't marry Sonja he wouldn't marry at all. Since Harald was the sole heir to the throne, and his not marrying would have meant the end of the Norwegian monarchy, and they had been dating for almost a decade by that point, Olav relented. Fifty years later, they're still happily married.
</li><li> King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden was notorious in his belief that royalty should only marry other royalty, which led many of his sons to marry without his approval and lose their titles and succession rights in the process just to get out of hearing the parental marriage vetoes. Gustaf VI Adolf's son, Prince Bertil, and his grandson, Carl XVI Gustaf, had to wait until after his death and Carl XVI Gustaf's accession to the throne before they could marry their commoner brides. Carl XVI Gustaf and his bride, Silvia Sommerlath, had to wait for four years. Bertil and his love, Lilian Craig, had waited for forty-three.
</li><li> Empress Nagako/Kojun of Japan allegedly opposed the marriage of her son, the then-Crown Prince Akihito to Michiko Shoda, due to the fact that Michiko was a commoner and her family was Roman Catholic. While they did marry, relations between Nagako and Michiko remained strained for the entirety of the empress' life, as she disapproved of Michiko's hands-on mothering in contrast to the traditional separation of imperial children from their parents and Michiko herself is said to have wondered why her mother-in-law disliked her. Some sources even say the intrigues took a life long toll on Michiko and that she never fully regained the confidence she'd had in her youth.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> In the Baha'i faith, a couple cannot get married unless they both get the consent of their parents. If one of them vetoes it, they'll just have to wait until the grouch keels over (or just become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">self made orphans</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NouveauRiche">Consuelo Vanderbilt</a> had hoped to marry Winthrop Rutherfurd. Her mother refused, because she set up her marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpoverishedPatrician">the Duke of Marlborough</a>. To this end, she first begged, ordered, and even faked a fatal illness to force her daughter to marry the Duke. Her daughter finally relented, after which her mother's fatal illness miraculously got cured. It would not be an understatement to call the marriage "unhappy" (famously, the married couple always dined with a gigantic centerpiece placed on the table between them so that they do not have to see each other even when etiquette dictate that they must be in the same room at the same time).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JRRTolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s own romance, which became the basis for the story of Beren and Lúthien. Tolkien met Edith Bratt at 16 and 19 respectively and fell in love, but his guardian Father Morgan later forbade contact between them until Tolkien became a legal adult at 21. He wrote her on the evening his twenty-first birthday and found out she was engaged to another man. She broke it off, though, when she learned he hadn't forgotten her, and accepted Tolkien's marriage proposal. Tolkien described their troubled courtship in considerable detail in a letter to their son, acknowledging that his guardian had a point as 'Falling in love, even a true and lasting love' is not really a good thing for a young man who should be concentrating on his education. Tolkien also emphasized that Edith had made him no promises and was completely free. Had she chosen to go through with her first engagement he, Tolkien, would have had no grounds for complaint.
</li><li> When Marie Curie was working as a governess to put her sister through university, she fell in love with the son of her employer, but they rejected on the grounds that she was too poor. This was actually a good thing for the world as she and the man she did marry, Pierre Curie, were a fantastic scientific team.
</li><li> Dorothy Osborne and Sir William Temple were a famous 17th Century English couple, who finally managed to marry after her father died (and she suffered smallpox, to the ruin of her looks and the loss of any other marriage prospects.)
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/TropesAreTools">This isn't always a bad trope.</a> For all the times parents/family object on unreasonable grounds, there are times when loved ones have the ability to realise two people shouldn't take such a big step and, if said step is taken, are eventually proven right.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NapoleonBonaparte">Napoléon Bonaparte</a>, who had a thing for arranging marriages around him, pulled this on his youngest brother Jérôme when he married an American heiress in 1803 ; when he became Emperor, Napoleon annulled the marriage with a decree in 1805 on the grounds that Jérôme was a minor when he married. Napoleon also objected to the second marriage his brother Lucien made out of love, but could not convince him to divorce and Lucien preferred to go into exile rather than renouncing his beloved wife.
</li><li> Dieudonné Thiébault, father of General Paul Thiébault, attempted to prevent his son's remarriage to Elisabeth Chenais, citing her expensive tastes and unsavoury reputation as arguments against the match, but more importantly reminding Paul that he was still legally married to another woman when he proposed to Elisabeth. Paul ignored his father's objections, rushed through the divorce and married Elisabeth anyway... and despite his pledges of absolute truthfulness, he makes absolutely no mention of this in the Memoirs he wrote long after both his father and Elisabeth were dead.
</li><li> The Greek businessman Alexander Onassis Livanos had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretRelationship">Secret Relationship</a> with Fiona Thyssen, a divorcée <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">who was 16 years his senior</a> <em>and</em> whom he had a crush <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecociousCrush">since he was a pre-teen</a>. Alexander's parents, the powerful and rich entrepreneur Aristotle Onassis and his first wife Athina "Tina" Livanos, <em>really</em> disliked this and tried to sabotage their bonds: i.e, Thyssen <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">hated</a> the idea of being seen as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a> so when Onassis Sr. purchased Alexander a huge villa outside Athens <em>despite knowing this</em>, she took it as an insult from them.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties">The '50s</a>, a Japanese man named Toshimichi Okubo met Princess Aisin-Gioro Huisheng of China, and they fell in love. However, Huisheng's Japanese mother Princess Hiro Saga refused to let them stay together: both because he was a commoner and because her daughter was a candidate to get into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> to then-Crown Prince Akihito. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Huisheng and Okubo</a> ultimately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">commited suicide together.</a>
</li><li> Ancient Catholic traditions had a way to get around this and other vetoes: the priest being considered a mere witness, a couple could get around the veto by going to a priest with two other witnesses and declaring themselves husband and wife. Due the practice being much abused, the practice was eventually banned in the Council of Trento with the <em>Tametsi</em> decree... That also specifically banned the parental marriage veto.
</li><li> In a number of countries, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage">Arranged Marriage</a> is still common and is still done for the same reason. The big issue is that if a woman decides to flee the marriage and marry the person <em>she</em> wants, she stands a very good chance of being <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse">murdered by her own family</a></em> to "restore their honor."
</li><li> Carl and Marie von Clausewitz could have married earlier if not for Marie's mother's determination to find a more suitable match for her only surviving daughter (Marie was a Countess and Carl was, at the time, a junior officer of questionable nobility). However, Sophie von Brühl eventually consented to the marriage and this delay was one of the many obstacles that only deepened their bond.
