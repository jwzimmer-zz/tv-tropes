The vast majority of the time, male characters are attracted to women, and female characters are attracted to men, there are some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerAsTropes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerAsTropes">gay and lesbian characters</a>, and very rarely you'll get a bisexual character (unless it's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QueerRomance">Queer Romance</a>, where naturally the last two categories are more common), but others aren't so definite. Sometimes there's a male/female character who doesn't express interest in women/men but does seems to show interest in people the same gender as they; they're <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a>. Then there are characters that seemingly show romantic and/or sexual interest in people of multiple genders; they're Ambiguously Bi.

Characters with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life Partner</a> are especially prone to this, as while they might have an actual love interest of a different gender or try to get a love interest through flirting and having crushes on women, the relationship with their HLP often has a romantic/sexual element as well. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">Getting Crap Past the Radar</a> can be a reason for this trope, the writers wanting to include hints a character is gay or bi but with enough heterosexuality to appease the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a>.
</p><p>It should be noted that what makes a character Ambiguously Bi and what differentiates them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bisexual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Bisexual">Bisexual</a> characters is largely a matter of opinion. The character does not have to officially be declared bi to qualify, and as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">No Bisexuals</a> demonstrates, even if a character is clearly bisexual to the audience, much of the time the writers dont consider it as a possibility. Obviously, some form of attraction to people of different genders is required, but the exact extent varies; for some people, an offhand comment or a prolonged glance can be enough; for others, nothing short of onscreen sex can suggest bisexuality as a possibility. Characters who express <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">If It's You, It's Okay</a> further muddle the issue, as by definition, that makes a character bisexual, but there <em>are</em> otherwise straight, gay, and lesbian people in real life who do have exceptions to the "rule" of their sexuality.

Even though we know that Griffith had sex with Princess Charlotte just to make himself feel better after Guts left, he might very well have had some unrequited feelings for both Guts <em>and</em> Casca, judging from how a) he was a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">Yandere</a> when it came to Guts, and even is depicted thinking and fixating on him while having sex with Charlotte, b) before activating his crimson behelit a la <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a>, Griffith did have a vision of he and Casca sharing a quiet, peaceful life together, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BabiesEverAfter">child and all</a>, and c) he gave Guts and Casca the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KubrickStare">Kubrick Stare</a> when it was evident that they had become a couple.

There's also his referring to Alois as an unsullied beauty. However, in one strip he acts completely disinterested in, and even shows contempt towards, guys at his party, instead preferring girls.

He even seems to occasionally reciprocate the male attention at times, though he could also just be trying to manipulate them for his own purposes.

She responds very excitedly to seeing this and takes pictures. Also, in terms of merchandise, the 2016 Funtom Café includes a Valentine's Day-exclusive charm of what looks like Elizabeth giving Sieglinde a heart-shaped chocolate while the two girls are inside a bottle filled with chocolates. They were also depicted together for the Valentine's Day picture the year prior. She also is very appreciative of Nina when she hit on her and chased Mei-rin around once because she wanted to dress her up and make her cuter.
</li><li> Edgar enjoys dancing with ladies but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">interactions</a> with Ciel are suspect. There's also his actions around Joanne.
</li><li> Ran-Mao sits on Lau's lap as eye candy, and acts flirtatiously around him and Ciel, but also once stripped Meirin in the behind-the-scenes episode and had them both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyShirtSwitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexyShirtSwitch">switch clothing</a> before rubbing Meirin's thigh seductively and grabbing her boobs.

</li><li> Bravat comments on the feminine features of a busty woman and Elizabeth's more flat chest, implying that he likes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomIsBetter">well-proportioned women</a>, but also acts ambiguously-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">flirtatious</a> to Sebastian and calls him pretty. Theres also his implied devotion to Ciel.
</li><li> Lau has Ran-Mao on his lap as eye candy and appears quite close with her. He also shows signs of being teasingly flirtatious towards Ciel and gets some moments with Sebastian.
</li><li> Meirin is definitely attracted to Sebastian, but shows some questionable moments around females. Chapter 93 features Meirin <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CovertPervert">peeking through her fingers</a> when Snake's pet snake slithers in between a maids boobs with the maid saying "Not there!" In season 2 of the anime, when the sexy maid Hannah sticks her fingers in her mouth to wet them to play an instrument, we see Finnian, Baldroy, and Meirin blushing and looking interested at the sight. Also, Meirin and Ran Mao get some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> in the behind-the-scenes OVA where Ran Mao pins a struggling Meirin down to strip her, and the scene is censored before we see they have switched clothes, with Meirin blushing as Ran Mao caresses her thigh and grabs her boobs. They also get a scene where they tie each others corsets in the manga and have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAngels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovelyAngels">Lovely Angels</a> dynamic there. Meirin even calls Angela "beautiful", takes care of her, and nosebleeds at the sight of her getting it on with Pluto, a human male/dog hybrid.

</li><li> Milly Ashford is strongly implied to have feelings for both Shirley and Lelouch.

Tachibana identifies as male and has always been interested in women, is in a woman's body and is falling for the male Jinguuji, while Jinguuji shows no interest at all in any woman and actually much prefers the company of Tachibana, considering him his oasis, but only shows attraction to him when Tachibana is in a woman's body, so maybe Jinguuji was always attracted to Tachibana and never realized. On the other hand, it's implied that Tachinana's charms works mostly on people who are already attracted to women. And there's the fact that it's possible both are simply under the effect of a curse.

A brainwashed Teru says that he will end their "relationship" if Mob doesn't lay off his attacks on the Divine Tree, refers to Mob having been the most important thing to him before his brainwashing, apologizes before hitting Mob with his power, and manages to comment through his brainwashing that Mob is "so amazing" while being blasted out of the Divine Tree.</span>

She also acts ominously seductive around Kanae <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who is revealed to be a girl and she strips her when torturing her, including putting her hands on her body</span>.
</li><li> Kaneki/Sasaki has ship tease with numerous ladies (including having a crush on Rize initially before he found out she was a ghoul and thinking that Touka is cute too as well as carrying her in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BridalCarry">Bridal Carry</a>).

</li><li> Hide shows interest in the ladies, like Touka and Rize, but also has a relationship with Kaneki that borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> at times. He happily accepted Kaneki despite knowing that he's a ghoul. The anime depicts him choosing to save Kaneki and spend his final moments with him rather than seek medical attention for his injuries.
</li><li> Tsukiyama blurs the line between murderous and amorous intentions towards Kaneki and was also mentioned to have a thing for Touka.

As a bonus, she forces herself to eat her cooking even though it's vile to her, just to spare Yoriko's feelings.
</li><li> Uta comments that Urie's moles are "sexy", gets rather close to Kaneki/Sasaki, comments on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Mutsuki's</a> good looks and also discusses girls with Shirazu. Also, Yomo and Uta started out as rivals, with the later becoming fascinated with the former. Itori likes to tease them about their past and in one of the Seiyuu events, the Live Drama involved Uta flirting with Yomo while touching his kagune. Uta ends up confessing to Yomo that the latter makes him feel alive.
</li><li> Mutsuki was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">born female and identifies as a male</a>.

They also get married.
</li><li> Seidous strong admiration towards Amon and Akira. Its also implied that Seidous one-sided rivalry with Akira (who is Amons partner) might be jealousy. There's also the omake where Seidou gets jealous of Suzuya when he sees him giving Amon some sweets thinking he's trying to get on Amon's good side and despairs over how he's been unable to grow closer to Amon thus far.
</li><li> Banjou has an established crush on Rize but also has his share of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> and protectiveness towards Kaneki.

They also changed almost none of the dialogue with her confessing her love and adoration to Zakuro/Renee.
</li><li> Sumire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/VenusVersusVirus">Venus Versus Virus</a></em> has a very intense bond with her friend Lucia, who is later confirmed in the manga to be in love with her, but also has a very important male love interest.

Later in the manga she has ambiguous feelings towards a male teacher that not even she understands.

While the comic never confirmed the exact nature of their relationship, when a fan asked Marjorie Lu if Johnny and Daken were sleeping together, she replied with: "They better have been, given all the hard work we put into creating sexual tension between their characters."

<ul><li> Not to mention the fact that he publicly apologizes to both men and women when his dating profile is taken down in the comics....and when its put back up, it noticeably allows both men and women to send requests. Theres also a party scene from the Superior Iron Man issue that displays a half-naked Tony surrounded by both men and women who are also in various states of undress  while in his bedroom.

</li><li> As far as the movie version goes, some of Tonys more obvious indicators include telling Hawkeye to clench up when he carries him with the Iron Man suit, patting Thors biceps while complimenting his swing, joking about performance issues with Loki, asking his teammates as a whole (four out of five of which are male) if someone kissed him, and, of course, the ever-infamous Americas ass scene (in which Tony, completely unprompted, calls attention to and comments on Steves ass).

If his backstory where when he was human, he had a wife and a daughter is in the movie-verse. He also flirts a bit in the official prequel comic with Tooth during his introduction. However, he also seems to be very touchy-feely with Jack. In the Antarctica scene, he always claimed that he and Jack were the same, touching him when he proposed him to join his side (and in one of early artworks, he even strokes his jaw with a smug smile) and is hurt by his rejection. Furthermore, he even called Bunnymund "cute" for mocking him, making Bunnymund slightly scared (though Bunny was probably just worried Pitch might try to harm him).

Dave seems omni-sexual, judging from his obvious attraction to women like the CIA agent, as well as some weird things he says (apparently he watches gay porn). He also didn't mind kissing Kim, the male leader of North Korea, when playing spin the bottle with him or his best male friend Aaron.

What's far less clear is whether his elaborate bragging about his prowess with girls has any actual intention behind it, other than to hide his sexuality from his friends. On the one hand, as an adult he claims publicly to have a girlfriend who is clearly fabricated (but could conceivably be based on an ex); on the other, as a teenager he does join the other boys in briefly ogling Bev in her underwear (but it's established elsewhere that he overcompensates in order to fit in with his straight peers).</span>

Titus is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova">The Casanova</a> whose defining scene is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroGSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroGSpot">Zero-G Spot</a> pseudo-orgy of heavy petting with women. He plans to secure his claim to Earth by marrying Jupiter, and all that implies. There's also the scene where Titus tries to kill Caine which reeks of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a>, complete with whispering his evil plan in Caine's ear while circling around him.
</li><li> Kalique has two suggestive scenes with both genders. In one scene she strips naked in front of Jupiter, looks at her seductively, and then rises from her bath with a glamorous young body (in one of the only nude scenes in the movie). There's also her compliments on Caine's physique when he barges into her palace with no shirt on.

However, neither discusses her orientation, and since Natasha says she's never been attracted to a woman before it's obviously still new to her. Given that a lot of what she says is dubious, some or all of this may be an act too.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie">Scary Movie</a></em>: Buffy and Cindy have boyfriends, but mention going down on each other one time.

When telling the story of the day Mystery Inc. kicked Scrappy-Doo off the team, Velma describes Daphne as "so beautiful" and Fred as "so handsome". For what it's worth, Velma was originally going to be depicted as a lesbian in the film's much raunchier original cut, and a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOOEwMOtvLI&amp;pbjreload=101">deleted scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> from the final film has her singing "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" while dancing sensually and making motions towards Daphne and/or Fred (they're both standing next to each other and the scene is framed in such a way that it's not clear if she's singing to Daphne, Fred, or both.)

Despite his obsession with an unattainable elf girl, he travels and becomes EXTREMELY close to his half-brother Murtagh, and starts getting vengeful and sulky when Murtagh turns out to think he's an annoying little twerp. Additionally he never notices Arya's characteristics (read: breasts), but he spends a lot of time ogling his master's muscles, "port-red lips" and long, flowing hair, and starts staring intently at the guy's "hairless groin" during a naked bath scene. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeRomanceSubtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeRomanceSubtext">He also ogles the "hard and lean" muscles of his crippled ex-nemesis</a>.

Things get better when she starts hanging out with her brother's friends, but it's clear that losing the friendship she and Raejean once had is a life-changing experience for Jenna.

Upon reflection, especially when it comes to her relationship with Raejean, Jenna decides that she can't be 100% certain she's straight, and answers accordingly.

Danny and Karl are old university buddies, Danny is married to a woman and Karl is a player who regularly dates younger women.

It's unclear if Karl has any interest in other men in real life, but it is clear that his active dating life with real women slows down and eventually ceases altogether. Danny finds the digital affair having a strain on his real marriage, but Karl insists that it's not "real cheating".

She also has some innuendo with Lilah in her first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel">Angel</a></em> arc (it's been said in interviews that this was so strong in early takes that the actresses were ordered to tone it down). Her having a crush on Buffy is seemingly confirmed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">the First as the Mayor</a> in season 7, and her actress, Eliza Dushku, said that she always thought that Faith definitely had something for Buffy. In season 8 Faith herself denies this, but it isn't like this would be the first time Faith has lied about something personal, and the very same arc included some heavy-handed lesbian innuendo between Faith and Gigi.
</li><li> Buffy was definitely in love with Angel and Riley (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveRomance">whatever she had</a> with Spike), but her legendary <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> with Faith was hardly one-sided, her and Willow have all the signs of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">Romantic Two-Girl Friendship</a>, and season 5 kept drawing parallels between her and Dawn and Willow and Tara. In season 9, she thinks she slept with Willow after a night of partying, but didn't.

</li><li> In the first three seasons this was the case for both Willow and Xander, having explicit crushes and relationships with men and women respectively, but also creating lots of subtext and various (intentional and unintentional) homoerotic comments. Then Willow came out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBisexuals">as a supposed lesbian</a> and they both...became even <em>more</em> ambiguous (especially when Spike was involved, in Xander's case.

Naturally this is part of her obsession with becoming her, but even next season when their relationship is at least <em>closer</em> to normal, she still seems rather fixated on seeing her naked.

Although she sometimes has romantic subtext with a male guest character, especially Mike in "Remembrance of the Daleks" and Sorin in "The Curse of Fenric", she also forms some <strong>very</strong> intense relationships with other young women. Especially in "Ghost Light" (in which she dresses up in male Victorian evening dress in a way that in a classic Hollywood movie would scream <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">"lesbian"</a> and then runs around holding hands with a girl, with whom she has two separate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight">Cat Fights</a>, one on a bed) and "Survival" (in which the scriptwriter explicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGay">declared</a> that the very "Women Who Run With The Wolves" relationship between her and werecheetah Karra was deliberately homoerotic). However, her appearances in adult-aimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> material with more overt sexual content depict her as straight.

The one who is now a main cast member has a man as her only known love interest but, aside from the one who was with a woman at one point being her too, she also regularly makes homoerotic comments. For example: She mentions that Jane Austen is a "phenomenal kisser". When shown a picture of Amy Pond, she loudly admires the fact that "That woman's <em>made</em> of legs!"
</li><li> The good ol' Doc themself. Eight was all but stated to have had romantic relationships with both male and female Companions (he kisses Grace in his only televised outing, and Big Finish all but states he and Fritz are in a relationship). The Eleventh Doctor has a metric buttload of playful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> with Rory Williams, full on snogging him once. There are other offhand lines, such as referring to Amy's male friend as "the good-looking one," or saying of the American founding fathers, "Lovely fellows. Two of them fancied me," or of a wedding, "I danced with everyone at their wedding. The women were all brilliant. The men... were a bit shy." However, he's accidentally been married to women on multiple occasions, and though the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHuggingNoKissing">No Hugging, No Kissing</a> rule exists he's had an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a> relationship with more than one female companion in the new <em>and</em> old series, and he does have a granddaughter. <em>However</em> however, the Doctor's view of sex and romance has always been very alien. Being kissed and left totally bewildered by it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> over multiple incarnations, and there are also a ton of instances like where someone said he wouldn't mind putting the "Dark Water" that makes non-organic matter transparent while leaving organic material present (thus hiding until the climax that the skeletons in a mausoleum <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> aren't skeletons, they're Cybermen!</span>) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerPerversionPotential">in a swimming pool</a>, the Doctor was genuinely confused as to why. It would seem that they <em>have</em> a sexuality, but it's quite alien. On top of that, throw in regeneration; their idea of sexuality might be as malleable as other aspects of them that change with the incarnation.
</li><li> More than one male character has not minded his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> moments with the Doctor much at all, but it went no further than that. <em>Also</em>, as this is a show that, since the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">Revival</a>, does not shy away from having characters who are gay or bi, ambiguous moments are more ambiguous than in other series.

Of course, it later turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Charlotte has been gaslighting Tess about her sex life for years to cover up the fact that she gave Tess' son to the Green</span>, so it's possible that Charlotte is exaggerating.

She is never clearly stated to have slept with a woman, but she flirts with <strong>everyone</strong> at some point, including several female regulars.

However, when talking with Sansa about romance, she lists the guys in a monotone voice, but perks up when she gets to "pretty girls." Then she talks about how sad it is that most girls don't get to try everything they want, and looks directly at Sansa.
</li><li> Ramsay has an explicit relationship with Myranda but his "games" with Theon/Reek are filled with 100% nightmare-inducing homosexual undertones. In Season 4, he helps Theon/Reek bathe and even asks if Reek loves him.
</li><li> Daenerys has more than a few quasi-romantic moments with Doreah and Missandei, and she seems amused when Yara Greyjoy flirts with her. She's only ever consummated things with men as far as we know, though. In the books, she <em>does</em> take Irri into her bed on a couple of occasions between Khal Drogo's death and when she eventually hooks up with Daario.
</li><li> It's highly debatable with Selyse; she seems to ogle a naked Melisandre, but the look on her face is open to interpretation. Is it desire for the Red Woman, or jealousy of such a perfect-bodied, confident, powerful woman who gave Stannis a son? With the revelation of Melisandre's true form, some are positing on whether or not Selyse was witness to this beforehand, since Melisandre was not wearing the necklace that supports her magic at the time.

Eleanor is canonically bisexual, and has an expressed an attraction to Tahani, sometimes openly flirting with her, and Tahani doesn't appear to mind this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">We also find out that in at least one of the reboots, Michael set the two of them up as soulmates, and Tahani seemed quite eager to impress Eleanor upon their first meeting.</span> Then there's this bit of dialogue...

However, Janet (who quite literally knows <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker">everything</a></em>) creates a hyper-realistic simulation which includes Simone. By Janet's own admission, the unpredictability of life means the simulation can't be 100% accurate, but since she knows everything there is to know about Simone, it's about as close as it gets. In one run in the simulation, Eleanor and Simone chat, which then turns into them flirting and holding hands, and Eleanor leaning in for a kiss (Chidi stops her, much to her annoyance). Simone appears to be just as into it as she is, indicating that if the simulation is as accurate as Janet says, she might be bisexual and not averse to the idea of hooking up with Eleanor.

<ul><li> Although Oswald The Penguin Cobblepot makes his attraction to Ed Nygma explicit, his actor, Robin Lord Taylor has suggested that if a woman had treated him with the decency that Ed showed him, he would likely fall for her as well; supporting Taylors theory, Oswald does not take Sofia Falcone kissing James Gordon very well, even though he does not explicitly express attraction towards her.

By the end of the first season, Eve seems unsure herself. It could be her preference is "men and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfItsYouItsOkay">Villanelle</a>."
</li><li> On the other side of things, Villanelle is up for having sex with men and women alike, but has only ever been known to be infatuated with women. It's possible she's homoromantic and bisexual, or that she sleeps with men when it's more convenient (or when it helps her plans), but is personally into women.

</li><li> Nate is very similar. He ends up in relationships with Amaya and later Zari, but he frequently makes comments about the attractiveness of other men, especially Ray. At <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Hank's funeral</span>, they even give each other a kiss on the cheek without thinking. He also has a "man crush" on Dion.
</li><li> Leonard Snart, although this is most likely deliberate, given that Wentworth Miller pitched the idea to the writers that the characters was pansexual.

Her affairs with older men serve as the motive for many suspects in the show's universe, and she was shown to be popular with boys her own age as well. She also had a private, unofficial relationship with the then-closeted Emily, though her attraction was implied to be disingenuous— even still, she assures Emily that she favors her above all others. Alison's extreme protectiveness over the three girls is evident, but her manipulation regarding Emily seems solely focused on keeping her from coming out and connecting with other queer women. She goes so far as to extort Paige, a later love interest for Emily, and delays their relationship by several years, though Alison likely intended to prevent it entirely. Additionally, she led Spencer in a romantic slow-dance with the casual handwave that it was only "practice" for dancing with boys, the same excuse she gave for kissing Emily, and it's heavily implied Alison would tease and flirt with all the girls under the guise of "practice." <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> confirmed, when she confessed her feelings for Emily to Paige</span>

As Stevens has never spoken publicly about his sexuality, his fans tend to read into his lyrics whatever they want to see in them.

And in his ending, he may be accompanied by one of two guys to quest for other civilizations. A character in <em>Awakening</em> implies that he is Ike's descendant, though in what way is made ambiguous, as a wife is never mentioned, and his sister can marry and possibly bear collateral descendants.

However, she's <em>incredibly</em> possessive of her retainers (both of whom are female), particularly Selena (who happens to be the aforementioned Severa under an alias) and the (potentially female) Avatar. Her rather flirty-sounding dialogue with Corrin is also unchanged regardless of whether you're playing as male or female.

</li><li> Likewise, while Hubert can romance any of the Black Eagle girls, Shamir, or a female Byleth, he seems to take an interest in Ferdinand. Notably, his A+ support with Ferdinand is one of the only two where Hubert blushes.
</li><li> Petra isn't a romance option for a female Byleth, but her paired ending with the actually-bi Dorothea mentions that Dorothea "became the person that Petra loved most."
</li><li> Ashe has multiple paired endings with women that end in marriage, but he also seems quite close to Dedue, even worrying more about him than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Dimitri's horrible death on the Verdant Wind and Silver Snow routes.</span> His paired ending with Caspar can also be potentially read as romantic.
</li><li> Annette has several romantic endings with men, but her support chain and paired ending with the actually-bi Mercedes can be read as romantic.
</li><li> Dimitri can only be romanced by a female Byleth, but he treats both genders the same regardless, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> and all. His paired ending with Dedue mentions that they acted more like family in private, but whether this means like brothers or lovers is left to interpretation.
</li><li> Sylvain is an infamous skirt-chaser, but is strongly implied to be bisexual. He doesn't exactly deny it when Flayn brings up a rumor that he hits on both men and women, he seems eager to settle down with Felix in their <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Azure Moon</span> paired ending and their support uses more romantic language in the Japanese version. In the Japanese version, he hit on a man disguised as a woman at a festival, and he also flirts with Ashe a bit, even suggesting that Ashe might have fallen for him.
</li><li> Felix has several paired endings with women that end in romance (especially on the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Azure Moon</span> route), but he also seems willing to settle down with Sylvain, in addition to their support having more romantic language in Japanese. In both the localized and Japanese version of their <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Azure Moon</span> paired ending, they become so close as to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TogetherInDeath">pass away on the same day in their later years.</a> Notably, the ending makes no mention of either marrying anyone else.

The relationship between the canon male protagonist and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Aigis</a> is a major part of the game, and some romantic tension is thrown in it as well. Absolutely none of this is changed for the female protagonist (naturally, she can hook up with three of your four male party members and is the target of two of her male Social Links' affections), and it's highlighted in Aigis's Social Link in that additional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gayngst">Gayngst</a> is added on her part.
</li><li> Yukari develops a crush on the male protagonist and can be romanced by him, though her relationship with the female protagonist shares just enough dialogue to suggest that she might see her the same way. She also becomes very emotionally dependent on Mitsuru <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">after the protagonist's death</span>. And speaking of Mitsuru, she considers eloping with either version of the protagonist, before dumping her arranged fiancé because he insulted them.

It's possible for the protagonist to date either one (or both) of them, but their relationship with each other is dripping with lesbian subtext, to the point that it forms the basis for their Shadows. Shadow Chie rants about how possessive Chie is of Yukiko, and her berserk form resembles a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dominatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dominatrix">Dominatrix</a> on a throne made of schoolgirls. On Yukiko's end, Shadow Yukiko explains how she once thought Chie was her ideal "prince" who would be her excuse to run away from home and never come back. After their Shadow-based issues are resolved, the two of them are more affectionate towards each other, even occasionally using their respective Shadow's words to reaffirm how close they are.
</li><li> Yosuke and the protagonist are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">Heterosexual Life-Partners</a>, and he canonically has a crush on Saki, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">Dummied Out</a> dialogue suggests he was originally planned as the protagonist's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayOption">Gay Option</a>. On top of all that, In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4Arena">Persona 4: Arena</a></em> he seems to have crushes on Mitsuru, Labrys and Akihiko.
</li><li> Teddie acts very flirty towards the protagonist, and kissed Kanji while drunk at the kings game. He also enjoyed cross dressing as he dressed up as Alice during the school cross dressing contest and he picked out an outfit for his human form to wear that looked camp. However, he's usually hitting on women whenever he gets the chance to.
</li><li> The <em>P4</em> hero can be played this way. There's nothing stopping you from romancing any of the girls while flirting with Kanji, Teddie, and Yosuke, only the latter of whom will have a problem with it.

He shows interest in seeing both Ann and the protagonist in the buff, and not very professionally either. That said, he shows a similar interest in a pair of lobsters, and shows an aversion to romance at times. That said, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MatthewMercer">Matthew Mercer</a>, Yusuke's English VA <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfSaintPaul">has expressed that he does believe Yusuke to be bisexual.</a>

</li><li> Joker, the protagonist himself, can only enter romantic relationships with his female confidants, but shows hints of flirting in certain dialogue options for his conversations with Yusuke and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Akechi</a>.

That's not even covering his dream about pregnancy and maternal attitude towards the main villain... And yet if plot points of the game and previous interpretations of the character are anything to go by, he is quite clearly attracted to other females of his species.

</li><li> Caliborn is clearly interested in "the bitches", but also has quite a bit of a (one-sided) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousCrush">Villainous Crush</a> on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dirk</span>, to the point of drawing fanart of the two of them being "more than friendly" together. (This being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TerribleArtist">Caliborn</a>, though, it's impossible to tell what he <em>actually</em> drew.)
</li><li> Rose is dating a girl, but is also fond of certain masculine literary figures and implies that she and Dave treated one another differently before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they found out they were brother and sister</span>.
</li><li> Post-retcon, the Vriskagram suggests that Dave and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Karkat</span> might be in a romantic relationship. In his later conversation with John, Dave resists identifying as either exclusively straight or exclusively gay. He crosses out of this trope and into explicit bisexuality after asking Dirk for advice on how to come out to one's friends.
</li><li> Pre-retcon, Roxy had a staggering amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Calliope and at least a little with Jane; post-retcon, she spends about 5 lines constructing an elaborate description of how hot Jane is. On the other hand, she's expressed much more direct interest in both Dirk and John.
</li><li> Some of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllTrollsAreDifferent">trolls</a> are only shown attracted to one gender or aren't shown in a relationship at all, but are assumed to be bisexual due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">that being the norm in troll society</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/MenageA3">Ménage à 3</a></em> does this a lot, although over time it tends to settle down to making <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">most (though not all) of its characters definitively bi</a>.
<ul><li> For example, DiDi, Sandra, Sonya and Gary have all claimed to be straight, but hinted at or dabbled in bisexuality at times from the first (DiDi and Sandra even went so far as to attempt lesbian sex with each other, only to conclude that they were really "two naked straight girls with poor boundary issues"); DiDi and Sonya are nowadays fully functionally bisexual.
</li><li> Also, Zii always held that Yuki was not a lesbian, she just didn't like penises due to a childhood trauma from the work left lying around the home by her father, a manga-artist who became famous as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllAnimeIsNaughtyTentacles">"The Tentacle King"</a> — and this now appears to be entirely correct.
</li><li> After it seemed that Sandra's heterosexuality had been confirmed by her attempt with DiDi, spinoff comic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraOnTheRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SandraOnTheRocks">Sandra on the Rocks</a></em> had Cammi bring the trope racing back to the surface for her. And then there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InVinoVeritas">her tendency to grope other women when drunk</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Becoming a successful model does wonders for her confidence, and by the end she can comfortably flirt with women while sober. She officially ends the comic as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBi">But Not Too Bi</a> due to not wanting to put a label on her sexuality, and in the final strip, she confesses her love to Cammi and the two get together for real</span>. Also in that comic, teenage geek Alex seems increasingly ambiguous about his complete commitment to heterosexuality, especially after Sandra vomiting on him made him start to associate attractive women with vomit. However, the only "boy" he shows attraction to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetOnPollyOliver">is actually a girl in disguise</a>, and this subplot resolves itself off-camera during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip">Time Skip</a> with him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">scoring a threesome with said girl and her girlfriend</span>.
</li><li> Another spinoff comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StickyDillyBuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StickyDillyBuns">Sticky Dilly Buns</a></em>, has Jerzy, who keeps insisting that bisexuality was a stage on the road to homosexuality for him. This might be more convincing if he didn't still sometimes have sex with women.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>:
<ul><li> Peter is married to Lois is mostly shown to be heterosexual. In one episode where Peter starts spending time with Bill Clinton the two hit it off right away, but Peter spends so much time with him that it damages his relationship with Lois. By the end of the episode both of them have been physically seduced by Clinton, the last scene being a shot of Peter lying in bed next to Clinton, and Peter states: "Boy you are good. You are really good." In another episode, Peter and Quagmire are just about to have sex in order to convince a prostitute that Quagmire is gay. They stop at the last minute, and Quagmire admits he's not gay, but Peter adds "Well I'm something, because I've been at full sail this whole time."
</li><li> Lois is married to Peter occasionally hints at having had same-sex experiences in the past. One episode revealed that she had a girlfriend in college. When Peter ranted on TV about how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllWomenArePrudes">All Women Are Prudes</a> and lead men on with no intention of ever sleeping with them, Lois (who was watching at home) responded, "He's right! Women are such teases! That's why I went back to men."
</li><li> Meg likes boys, but has also hinted being attracted to Connie. There was also the episode where she pretended to be a lesbian to join her school's Lesbian Alliance club and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IJustWantToHaveFriends">actually have friends for once</a>, but confessed she was straight once she couldn't go through with actually having sex with a girl. However, said girl proceeded to berate Meg for "choosing" to be straight. When Meg replied that sexual orientation is not a choice, the girl said that only applies to guys, while girls <em>do</em> get to choose. So it would seem that all girls and women in the <em>Family Guy</em> universe are technically bisexual no matter what they identify as... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">at least until the next episode when that joke has been forgotten about</a>. Although in a later episode, Stewie time-travels to the future and discovers that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Meg has become Ron</a>, so that joke might not have been entirely forgotten about after all.
</li><li> Stewie has had a lot of moments that were considered by many fans to be gay as he apparently showed attraction to several men, which is easily dismissed since he is just a one-year-old baby. However, he has fallen in love with girls, including Olivia.
</li><li> Surprisingly enough, Quagmire being a lady's man, has some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> moments with Peter. Like how when Peter was upset he asked Peter if he could "drag his ball sac across his face" (it's something he does to all his lady friends) and later willingly got naked in front of him and showed him his penis while also calling them "buddies" that should "have fun". Another scene in the episode "Mr and Mrs. Stewie" had them having to share a bed and Peter hugged Quagmire close from behind making it look like they were spooning and pulled Quagmire's boxers down with his foot because they were too starchy which Quagmire seemed to be fine with. He also seemed willing to lay naked with Peter and Lois when they got nude while doing drugs and said "Room for one more?" However, he did act disgusted when he and Peter kissed to try to prove to a prostitute that he was gay. And in another episode when Stewie places Quagmire, Joe, Brian, and Peter in an alternate reality where they were the only people left Quagmire says that at some point they would have to repopulate the planet. Brian pointed out that there were no woman and Quagmire said "Let's see what happens" leaving it ambiguous as to whether they should wait and see if any woman would show up or if they would try sex with each other.
</li><li> Jeff, a son of a nudist family, was definitely into Meg but also smiled happily when Peter got naked in front of him.

His friendship with Fry is also a funny one as Bender often gets depressed and weepy when Fry does something that makes Bender feel that Fry is abandoning him.
</li><li> Doctor Zoidberg also shows a lot of this as he was a little disappointed after Leela failed to marry him to Fry in space and there was some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> that he exhibited towards Farnsworth and Hermes. However, he has flirted with Edna and an unnamed jellyfish-like alien and near the end of the series, he starts a romance with Marianne. To make it more confusing, Zoidberg has been shown to be unable to tell the difference between male and female humans.
</li><li> Amy Wong also qualifies as she is in a romance with Kif and flirts with a lot of guys but she kissed Leela in "Bender's Game" while they are in an alternate reality that resembles Lord Of The Rings.
</li><li> Leela has Fry as her canon love interest, having an on and off relationship with him and dated several men, yet she enjoyed making out with Amy in "Bender's Game" while in the alternate reality of Cornwood. Whether that extends beyond that dimension is debatable but has not been seen.
</li><li> Zapp Brannigan has flirted with and slept with Leela and Amy and enjoyed getting Snu-Snu from several Amazonian women, yet he apparently went on a date with Richard Nixon's Head in "The Thief Of Baghead". He seemed pretty comfortable with the idea of sleeping with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">"Lee Lemon"</a> before finding out "he" was really Leela in disguise. He is also not ashamed to show nudity in front of other men such as Kif. Zapp does not even cover himself in front of other men whenever he is naked and some of the orders he gives out to Kif have some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> in them.
</li><li> Fry has an on and off relationship with Leela, dated Michelle before being frozen, dated other girls including Colleen, and unknowingly slept with his own grandma in Roswell in 1947. However, Fry has shown affection and love towards an alien being named Yivo, who has masculine and feminine characteristics but sounds more like a guy. Fry has also got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> with Bender, Zoidberg, and Jrrr and showed attraction to Zapp while genderswapped in Neutopia.

In one episode Homer and Chief Wiggum develop a friendship that verges on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> at times and in the episode "Donnie Fatso", Homer teams up with the FBI to infiltrate the mob, and becomes incredibly close to Fat Tony. True, the constant touching, hugging, and kisses on the cheek could be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWaved">Hand Waved</a> by Tony being an Italian gentleman, but when Tony dies of a heart attack during a sting, Homer mourns like he just lost the love of his life. He also flirts hopelessly with a "sensitive but rugged" manatee lover, completely failing to understand why Marge isn't in love with him.
</li><li> In "Lisa the Drama Queen", Lisa had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">Romantic Two-Girl Friendship</a> with a girl named Juliet—no surprise, since this story is a parody of the movie <em>Heavenly Creatures</em>. And according to "Holidays of Future Passed" (which probably isn't canon) Lisa had at least three girlfriends—two at the same time—in college before marrying Milhouse.
</li><li> Bart has had crushes on many girls, but has also admitted to being "a little attracted to Milhouse" (this may have been to annoy Homer, but the trope <em>is</em> called <em>Ambiguously</em> Bi), got very jealous when Milhouse got a girlfriend, was willing to pose as Ralph Wiggum's date to attend the Krusty Anniversary Special ("You don't want to know how far I'll go!"), and one episode, in which he temporarily becomes best friends with Nelson, ends with a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BrokebackMountain">Brokeback Mountain</a></em> parody.
</li><li> Milhouse seems to have crushes on both of the elder Simpson kids—his crush on Lisa is well established, of course, but he has also intoxicatedly said about Bart that "this guy here...this is the guy", was very jealous when Bart spent much time with Nelson and once jumped over a waterfall while exclaiming "I can't live in a world without Bart!". His file in the school psychiatrist's office says that he has "flamboyantly homosexual tendencies". In one episode Bart swaps lives with his rich look-alike and during dinner, Milhouse notices Barts' beautiful "half-siblings". He says they're beautiful, but then says just the girl, he didn't notice the beautiful boy. He says with a dreamy look on his face.
</li><li> Abe enjoys dreaming of being the Queen of the Old West (and marrying two gunslingers at the same time), and when he transforms into a woman after being off his meds, he is pretty excited about Jasper's interest in him. Plus he's president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance for some reason.
</li><li> Ralph Wiggum once referred to Bart as his boyfriend, and upon seeing Bart naked in the movie said "I like men now!". Another time he hugs Comic Book Guy and says he will never let go. He also has interest in Lisa.
</li><li> Chief Clancy Wiggum is clearly married to a woman and that Ralph is his son, but he has some questionable subtext with his partner, Lou. He also seemed to be attracted to Peter and Homer during their carwash sting operation in the crossover.
</li><li> Let's not forget Lenny and Carl, who have shown to have gay subtext between them, yet have also shown attraction to various women.
</li><li> Mob boss Fat Tony had a wife (now deceased), but also expressed interest in Homer during the latter's time as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a> for the police.

</li><li> Kyle also fits this due to the reason mentioned above with Stan Marsh. However, Kyle has dated Token's girlfriend.
</li><li> Randy Marsh, who is Stan's dad is married to Sharon, yet he was seen naked in the "Goobacks episode" during the male orgy scene occurring between a group of men who disliked the people from the future
</li><li> Jimbo Kern is living in a single house with his friend, Ned and Jimbo even said the word "fag" without getting bleeped, which if Mr. Garrison is to be believed means that Jimbo is one. Yet Jimbo was revealed to have been one of the people who slept with Liane Carman on the same night of Eric Carman's conception. Jimbo was also one of the men who along with Ned, peeped on Mrs. Tenorman taking off her bra and refused to participate in a gay orgy that was used to protest the future people.
</li><li> Ned Gerblansky also fits due to his funny relationship with Jimbo Kern and the fact that he lives with him. However, he was one of them revealed to have slept with Liane Cartman, participated with Jimbo in peeping on Mrs. Tenorman while she took off her bra, and he revealed in "Summer Sucks" that he had an ex wife.
</li><li> Mr. Garrison is shown to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampGay">Camp Gay</a> teacher who first had Mr. Slave as his boyfriend before Mr. Slave left Garrison after Garrison got a sex change. However, Mr. Garrison also slept with two lesbians, who were Alice and Xerxes, while still considering himself gay due to the sex change. Then he went back to being a guy again before he rapes the Canadian president to death out of spite. As of now, Mr. Garrison's sexual orientation is unknown after he reverts back to being a male.
</li><li> Butters also fits as his friendship with Cartman is littered with a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay">Foe Yay</a> and Butters is the most effeminate of all the boys.

<ul><li> This becomes more apparent in Season 4, where after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> learning to use magic without the wand</span>, some of her attacks are in the colors of the Pan Pride flag, and in one episode she shows a lot of interest in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonianBeauty">Brunzetta</a>, one of Marco's friends from his time in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside">Neverzone</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Tom may also count, especially when it comes to Marco. In one episode he's shown eating ice cream with the Pan flag colors, and that same episode has him bonding with Marco. In Season 4, there's an episode where Marco misplaces his swim trunks and wears Glossaryck's, mentioning that Tom likes them, and another episode where he brings up <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Star and Marco's kiss from the previous season, and asks how Star would feel if he kissed Marco and didn't tell her, suggesting that he has thought about doing that.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said that Rhombulus was in a gay relationship with Lekmet, but in one episode he confesses to having a crush on Queen Moon, and he considers it very embarrassing.
</li><li> Starfan13 also said in one of the Marco chats that Marco looked very handsome dressed as a prince, even though she confessed to having a crush on Star earlier. Possibly Marco is simply <em>that much</em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">Chick Magnet</a>. In another chat, she says her favourite version of Star in an episode where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">reality keeps changing and starting to fall apart because Star refuses to solve a math problem</a> is the male one.
</li><li> The creators joked that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi">Everyone Is Bi</a>, but it looks like they were serious. Jackie also dated Marco for a while, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> but in the last season, she's with a girl named Chloe and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says they are in a relationship.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Piper from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks">Storm Hawks</a></em> is a not-so-subtle example. She's had series-long <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> with Aerrow, but there are <em>plenty</em> of scenes around women where she seems a little too...interested, mostly around <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Master Cyclonis</a> and especially Starling. Whenever the latter is around she (unsuccessfully) tries to flirt/impress her and often fails, with cringeworthy results. Just watch <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcqR8U8K-U8">this clip<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Warden is attracted mainly to women (unrequited love for Alice, for example), but is also shown to be obsessed with Lord Stingray and Jared. (Although he was rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squicked</a> out by the latter's dream where they were making out.) And both obsessions come off as rather creepy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">especially with the former</a>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">Alice</a>, on the other hand, is usually shown as being attracted to men but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">wound up sleeping with the Mistress</span> at the end of "Stingstress". She quips afterwards that she had "forgotten how needy women can be". This would also make <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Mistress</span>, who's normally attracted to men, also Ambiguously Bi.
</li><li> While Jared is obviously attracted to women (including his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistaffCounterpart">Distaff Counterpart</a> Cherice), there was one episode back in the first season where he had a dream that he and Warden had switched places. And they proceeded to make out.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperNoobs">Super Noobs</a></em>:
<ul><li> Kevin Reynolds is implicitly shown to be this on a few occasions. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbhorrentAdmirer">runs away from the advances of a female student named Jesse</a> in one episode, who showed a one-sided crush on him, and in another, he had an apparent fanboy crush on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman">Superman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> parody known as The Incredibly Amazing Man, going so far as to make a marriage-like proposal to the aforementioned "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructiveSavior">hero</a>" so Kevin could become his sidekick. However, Kevin is also implied on a few occasions, like in "Noob Colored Glasses", to have a crush on Shope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em>
<ul><li> Starfire notably has interest in Robin but also can get quite affectionate around Raven and Terra (expressed primarily through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp">glomping</a>).
</li><li> Raven is implied but never confirmed to have feelings for Beast Boy (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble">it's unintentional</a>) and gets ship tease moments with Robin but also has ship tease moments with Terra and Starfire. However, the extreme emotional reactions she has towards Terra (when she betrayed her and her team) and Starfire (whenever she's hurt or has vanished) could also be because she's an emotionally repressed half demon who is very close to her friends and treats them like family.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>: Elmyra and Rhoda. Elmyra has a cute crush on Max and one short called "Can't Buy Me Love" has Elmyra meet an evil little girl called Rhoda. Elmyra sees hearts and positively MELTS when Rhoda says she'll let her be her best friend, and spends the rest of the picture bending over backwards to make Rhoda like her. It plays VERY much like any episode where Elmyra chases Max, only way more seriously, and heck, Elmyra even lets Rhoda HAVE Max (who doesn't want him after mere moments). And after she learns her lesson about not needing to give someone something so they'll like you, Rhoda comes by her window and says she'll be her friend again if Elmyra steals her mom's car keys and drives her to Utah. Instantly Elmyra says "okay" and rushes off eagerly to Rhoda's side. So not only is Elmyra completely infatuated with Rhoda, but apparently Rhoda can't leave Elmyra alone for five minutes, even after Elmyra dumped her. Elmyra also had a thing for chasing Fifi around, a voluptuous female skunk which persisted even after Fifi skunked her and had Elmyra go as far as to pose as Fifi's crush Pepe le Pew. The main thing keeping it ambiguous is the fact that Elmyra is very young and is implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyCravesAffection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyCravesAffection">desperately craving affection</a>.

</li><li> Owen is attracted to Izzy (who he later dates) but also obviously has a crush on Justin, often mentioning how attractive he is and even expressing a desire to kiss him at one point.
</li><li> Katie and Sadie had a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> between them as they cannot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticTwoGirlFriendship">bear to be separated from each other forcefully and they frequently comment on each others looks a lot</a>. However, both of them have crushes on multiple boys including Justin and Trent.
</li><li> Alejandro showed a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoYay">Ho Yay</a> towards Noah as he blatantly flirted with him in the Japan and Newfoundland episodes. However, Alejandro also flirted with several girls before starting a romance with Heather.
</li><li> Gwen has dated and made out with Trent and Duncan during her time on the show. However in the fifth season, she was more interested in getting Courtney's forgiveness for taking her boyfriend, Duncan away from her and she does eventually get her forgiveness. There was also tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> between Gwen and Courtney in "World Tour" and "All Stars".
</li><li> Courtney had a romance with Duncan in the first three seasons before flirting with Alejandro and them starting a brief romance with Scott. However, she had tons of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a> with Gwen in "World Tour" and "All Stars" and even went as far as complementing Gwen's hair in one episode.

<ul><li> Queen Bee, according to Batman, can control "most men and some women", and gets curiously intimate with both Garfield and Megan within minutes. This is complicated somewhat by Bee coming off as one of the more sociopathic members of the Light, and the fact that her powers work on the attraction of others, and not necessarily her own. Amb Bi in her case is just as likely to mean she swings one way or another as she doesn't swing in either direction at all.
</li><li> Garfield Logan (aka Beast Boy)'s mother Marie Logan, though it's only by reading between the lines that it becomes obvious. Between the first and second season she was killed by Queen Bee, who as stated above uses her powers to control people who are attracted to women, so whatever Marie was she wasn't 100% straight. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GregWeisman">Greg Weisman</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">responded</a> when asked if Marie was a lesbian or bisexual with "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MathematiciansAnswer">Yes</a>" when asked.

He also created an army of cheerleaders robots and enjoyed kissing one. Oh, and in the evil future where he takes over? He apparently has Chase Young constantly being tied up in nothing but his underwear, with butter being slathered on his abdomen, while Wuya is suspended from a wall in a cheerleader outfit.
