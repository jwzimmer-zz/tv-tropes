Going off to Rape and Pillage sounds like jolly good fun, but takes a dark turn if someone states "...Well, <em>not</em> pillaging".
</li><li> Comedian Mike Birbiglia had a woman let him into his apartment building while he was lugging a large mattress and found it difficult to reach for his keys. She justified letting a stranger into the building by saying "I know you're not a rapist because a rapist wouldn't have a bed like that".

</div></li><li> A considerably positive example is the stand-up comedy tour <em>Rape is Real &amp; Everywhere</em>, which is made by female stand-up comedians and without lacking fun is still use to raise conscience.

<ul><li> In the opening gag, where Peter tries to make true his latest "dream" of being a rodeo star, he is bucked off a bull (during a bull-riding event), after which the steer performs an act widely interpreted as a sexual assault. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0gl1l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0gl1l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0gl1l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In the real world, this would likely never happen, since the steer would be shot and killed immediately. If something like this were possible, Peter would have undoubtedly have been severely sickened or died from the assault.</span>
</li><li> In a later scene, after Meg returns home from prison (she had been sentenced to jail for harboring a fugitive), she repeatedly rapes Peter, first by deciding to share his shower.
</li></ul></li><li> The character of Glenn Quagmire lives and breathes this trope. He is guilty of rape, sexual harassment, sexual assault, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveTheDead">necrophilia</a>, and a host of other sex crimes (and for that matter, also non-sex crimes). He's been caught spying on ladies in changing rooms, been shown to keep a harem of Asian women who are likely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexSlave">sex slaves</a> in his home, blatantly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlippingAMickey">drugs</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DateRape">date rapes</a> multiple women, stole the murdered corpse of one of his dates so he could take it home to have sex with it, and is explicitly referred to as a convicted rapist more than once by the characters. It is all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> and relies <em>heavily</em> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">Refuge in Audacity</a>. Also, he does draw the line at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse">Domestic Abuse</a>.
</li><li> The neighbour Herbert, likewise, is an elderly man who is strongly implied to be a pedophile on his first appearance. Later episodes only make it even more explicit  while he has never been shown outright raping any children, he is almost always alluding to it in some way, shape, or form, or attempting to lure children to his house or trick them into touching <em>him</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> A recurring joke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BojackHorseman">Bojack Horseman</a></em> is that Sarah-Lynn was molested by her stepfather.

Naturally, the employer's pet white tiger, Tama, takes a liking to him, and, umm... yeah.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GakuenOuji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GakuenOuji">Gakuen Ouji</a></em> skirts the line with this. While the girls attempting to rape the male lead are seen as utterly depraved for doing so and it's not portrayed as being remotely okay or funny, the manga has an overall pretty wacky and over-the-top tone. Which makes it a bit hard to tell whether it's supposed to be taken seriously or not.
</li><li> Tequila's actions toward Kazuya in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalaxyAngel">Galaxy Angel</a> II</em> are played for laughs, although he's terrified; were it the other way around, the character would certainly have to be changed.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsSaurus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GirlsSaurus">Girls Saurus</a></em> opens with a burly, overweight, and generally hideous schoolgirl confessing to the male protagonist, and then take her clothes off. When he rejects her, she gets pissed off and beats him up thoroughly; the whole ordeal not only lands him in traction for a long while, but also gives him severe gynophobia. While the reader is made aware how strongly this affects him, few of the other cast members show much sympathy. <strong><em>None</em></strong> of the other main characters know about Shingo's phobia, except for the school nurse. The protagonist confided his condition to her hoping she could help, but this was a <strong>bad</strong> idea.

The same cannot be said though of Reika, who, after snapping, tries to physically force him to have sex with her (which is not played for laughs).

Her deranged idea of love, and Mahiro's terror, are made clear. Note also that Nyarko gets the same treatment; see under Rape of Women by Women.

Both of them are horrified by this (Hajime during and Kaoru after the fact), but it's played for laughs due to the jackhammer sound effects accompanying the scene.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hajime</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetroitMetalCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetroitMetalCity">You said you'd rape me ten times within one second.</a>

</li><li> Rimmer is repeatedly raped by female crew members in "Back in the Red" after drinking liquid sexual magnetism (although being Rimmer, he doesn't mind the sexual attention). Complicating the matter is the fact that Rimmer was because he was using the sexual magnetism virus, he's arguably the one raping them via drugging, since most women wouldn't consent to being in the <em>same room</em> as Rimmer if given the option. This one's sort of a gray area though, since it all turns out to be hallucinations.
<ul><li> In the non-hallucinated last part of the episode, Lister dumps a vial of the sexual magnetism virus on Rimmer, and we see him getting fondled by the male prisoners, and the earlier parts of the episode which take place in the aftermath, he's not on speaking terms with Lister, implying he was raped by the other prisoners.

According to the recaps of the event, she had just finished a very intense match, and kept calling Rimmer by a different name, suggesting severe head trauma. The humor is clearly centered around Rimmer's complete inability to bed a woman unless she had a concussion.
<ul><li> The canonical book gives greater detail, stating that Yvonne was attracted to Rimmer, and after the incident, thought she'd hallucinated it. While the books have a lot of the same gags as the show, some things are taken more seriously: a major character from "Last Human" is one Michael R. McGruder, the result of this. Apparently, Yvonne talked up Rimmer to such a degree that Michael sees him as a <em>legendary hero!</em>

In one episode the characters, who are all first year students in college, drunkenly swap stories about their first sexual encounter. Kingsley, desperate to hide the fact that he's still a virgin, concocts a story about losing his virginity at the age of 12 to a woman in her 30's in order to impress them.

This is treated seriously by all the other characters, even the father, Guy McMeekin who is sceptical about the possibility of a woman raping a man, but it is the subject of edgy humour, with the mother Pam McMeekin asking whether the player had been dressing slutty. The play itself is a dark comedy although Barsotti considers the possibility that it could be a comedy/horror mash-up in the sense that the subject matter is horrifying. To her credit, Carla bitterly regrets what has happened.

How they hooked up to begin with is never mentioned, but since this incident involved <a class="urllink" href="http://www.dominic-deegan.com/view.php?date=2005-07-22">kitty-ears and a bell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> even Dominic's ladyfriend, Luna, is inclined to agree that it's pretty funny. Dominic himself seems to recall it more with rueful embarrassment than with horror, as well. This attracted some controversy, but quickly took a back seat to what followed.
<ul><li> Later on we see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilCounterpart">Celesto Morgan</a> involved in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorsSavingThrow">fully consensual hookup</a> with Rachel.

Though played for laughs, Kim is later shown accompanying Davan to a rape survivors' support group. The topic was also handled more maturely: When the subject of male rape is brought up, Davan recognizes that some men wouldn't be bothered by unsolicited sex, but they would have every right to be, as opposed to most proponents of male rape who say men would not and cannot be disturbed by a woman raping them. Kim also goes through therapy for issues, having apparently done it in the past to other men.

As this is billed as a romantic comedy, we're encouraged to enjoy the joke being on her and root for the handyman in what is presented as a harmless revenge as he makes her cook and clean and be mother to his brood of unruly sons. Naturally, we're not encouraged to ponder too deeply on the fact that he's also having her sleep with him. Nor does our heroine apparently think any the less of him when she regains her memory. Cue happy ever after... Although he did make a possibly not-too-serious attempt to sleep with her straight off, once she made it clear she wasn't comfortable with the idea he backed off (and, er, made her sleep on the couch). They didn't sleep together until some way into the deception, after they'd genuinely falling for each other. Of course, sleeping with a woman who's got amnesia and thinks she's your wife is pretty dodgy whatever way you look at it.

</li><li> The Italian 70s comedy <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFriends">My Friends</a></em> has one of these — an underage girl not only is raped (and impregnated) by an older sleazy co-worker, she's also yelled at, ridiculed and humiliated by her father <em>and</em> her father's friends because of this ("Puttana!" which means "You whore!"). To make things worse, the girl was heavily implied to be mentally challenged. When said father then goes to confront the rapist, he finds out he's a huge menacing guy, which makes it all really funny because he can't kick his ass, so the rapist gets off scot-free. Most likely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, as the film is rich in sexist and other politically incorrect jokes.

An extremely depressing Irish ballad is sung by one of the protagonists about an Irish soldier's love for a girl. Returning from war, he finds that five British soldiers "had their way with her". A resounding chorus clarifies that it was consensual. Most of the humor comes from how it's sung, but <em>consent</em> is the punchline.

As they go into it, the girl starts to have second thoughts and urges the boy to stop for a moment and put on a condom; he ignores her. After struggling and screaming a bit, the girl breaks free and flees down the stairs and out of the dormitory, with the rapist awkwardly pursuing her with his trousers around his ankles. The mostly male crowd, not understanding what has just happened, laugh and applaud. It's clear the crowd is laughing at the rapist rather than the victim, but it's still uncomfortably inappropriate humor in the midst of a tragic scene.

</li><li> A Finnish black comedy, <em>Men cannot be raped</em>, deals with a female rape victim who runs into all the usual secondary traumas of skeptical police and disbelieving courts. After her attacker is acquitted, she gains vengeance by abducting him and subjecting him to sexual humiliation. When he brings a case against her, he too is humiliated by learning how rape victims are treated, especially a man who is wuss enough to let a woman dominate him, and then to complain about it afterwards. (This is a <em>Finnish</em> black comedy).His case is dismissed with a cursory policeman's comment of "Men cannot be raped", is, "don't waste police time".

Unfortunately, one of them tries to establish rules of conduct in the hope of making Emma feel comfortable, since being a woman on her own in a house full of men at the end of the world could make her feel insecure and that they were going to rape her, but the others turn on him, since he was the only one who even <em>thought</em> about rape, and they begin to accuse him of being a rapist. Emma, in another room, overhears them yelling about raping her, grabs an axe, takes all of their food at axe point and leaves.

</li><li> The writer John Barth likes this trope a lot. In his novel <em>Letters</em>, a plot about a serial rapist drugging and impregnating women is played for laughs. Rape is also treated lightly at best in books like <em>The Last Voyage of Somebody the Sailor</em> and <em>Giles Goat-Boy</em>. There's also a lot of it in <em>The Sot Weed Factor</em>, but that could be attributed to the fact that it's basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritualSuccessor">Spiritual Successor</a> to <em>Candide</em> (with some of Fielding's <em>Joseph Andrews</em> thrown in).

<ul><li> An unfortunately famous example was an episode of the French comedy shorts <em>Un gars Une fille</em>. The show told the daily lives of the constantly-bickering Jean et Alexandra. This episode had Alexandra getting her head stuck into the opening of her washing-machine. Cue Jean mocking her. But it didn't stop there.

In several episodes, she hides from him in terror, and in one he actually manages to jump her (the episode ends there, but apparently no actual rape resulted.)

The audience was <strong>dead silent</strong> throughout the entire skit and pretty much sums up why that entire year (one of many) was bad and why Lorne Michaels described that season as being the closest he's ever come to being fired.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AreYouBeingServed">Are You Being Served?</a></em> episode "The Erotic Dreams of Mrs. Slocombe" has a rape-y ending where Mr. Humphries is overwhelmed with uncharacteristic heterosexual urges and jumps Miss Brahms in the middle of a ballet. The episode ends right there and you're left with the impression that Mr. Humphries impulsively rogered Miss Brahms, who rarely takes kindly to ungentlemanly sexual advances.
</li><li> In the season five episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock">30 Rock</a></em> "The Fabian Strategy" we witness a pretty graphic example of marital rape of Paula Hornberger at the hands of her husband Pete. Pete is listing all that he can do with his newfound free time to Liz (i.e. going to the gym) and mentions towards the end that he even got to make love to his wife, but "she was still asleep so I didn't have to be gentle." Cue a cutaway close-up shot of Paula's face as she's snoring and being shaken up and down. It cuts back to Liz, horrified, claiming "That's one of the most upsetting things I've ever imagined!" to which Pete responds with "Are you sure? Think about it again," grinning like a sociopath. Cut back to the rape, but with even more intense shaking. Liz responds with "Yes!" She is still horrified.
<ul><li> Occurs again in "The Black Light Attack" when Tracy adds one of Liz's writers, Sue, to his entourage to prepare for having a daughter. She later rebels and goes out with a guy; when she returns, she looks disheveled and claims that her date put something in her drink and she doesn't remember what happened. Tracy's response? "That's not important right now..."

One sketch features a couple arguing about what seems to have been an affair on the part of the husband. The wife is relieved when he reveals that he wasn't having an affair with the woman—he was raping her. Then there's the "sex for houses" sketch, wherein a couple trying to buy a house agree to have sex with the seller 12 times in exchange for lowering the price. But when a new offer causes the seller to add more sessions to the arrangement, the couple ultimately decides to let him use the husband's mentally challenged sister in their place.

<ul><li> Although most examples of this series are in the Female on Male category, they managed to include a Male on Female example as well - in an episode where Al grills burgers, the prospect of such a manly activity (grilling, finally eating meat) made him so horny he grabbed Peggy against her will a couple of times and dragged her off-screen to rape her. Like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderFlip">Gender Flipped</a> version, this is played as just as much laughs.
</li><li> Also, while Bud was often the <em>victim</em> of this, he was the aggressor in one episode. Seeking revenge on a girl who's been stringing him along, Bud convinces the guy she's really interested in (and who could care less about her) to go along with his planentice the girl into meeting him under the bleachers for a round of quickie sex. Later, the girl is seen emerging from the bleachers, adjusting her clothes, apparently completely unawarethanks to the darknessthat <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BedTrick">she just had sex with Bud</a>, who the audience soon sees coming out a few minutes after she did.

<ul><li> In one episode during a filming a woman asks her where you can try on clothes she answers: "Is in the producer's office, but he makes you try a lots of different clothes".
</li><li> In another when she asks "where is the place where you undress", Bud answers; In your case, the principal's office.

Here, a woman comes into the police station distraught and says she's been raped. The husband, and, to a great extent, Barney, don't understand what the big deal is, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaritalRapeLicense">assuming that it would be impossible for a rape to happen inside a marriage</a>, since marriage implies a loving relationship and a greater sense of "consent". The District Attorney, a woman, and Sgt. Dietrich, *do* understand the gravity of the situation (and just how wrong the rape was), and the husband's lawyer, though agreeing with Linden and the husband, wants the case to go ahead because he wants the fame associated with it. Dietrich, Sgt. Harris and the DA spend the rest of the episode explaining how classless the husband was and how he needs to treat women with more respect. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The episode ultimately concludes by treating the incident as if it was "just another marriage disagreement", with the husband agreeing with Harris that he was just uncouth and was just clueless about how to treat women properly (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">which raises the question about how he got married in the first place</a>), learning, through the experience, just how to do it properly, causing his wife to forgive him and drop the whole matter</span>. Perhaps the only reason why the episode works is due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> (social inequity, though improving, still had quite a bit of work to do when the episode aired in 1978)- it's doubtful now that such a scenario, with society's greater understanding of the real impact of rape, even in marriage, could be played for laughs today.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreshMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FreshMeat">Fresh Meat</a></em>, a Channel 4 Sit-Com about first year college students, played with this. Through a convoluted series of events, one of the characters fears he may have raped a girl the night before (though it's made clear he didn't). Though rape is never played for laughs, his attempts to clarify what actually happened <em>are</em>.

A lot of this is an attempt to deal with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a> - the historical Emperor Nero certainly was a rapist - in a way that isn't absolutely traumatic to the family audience, but special mention must be given to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn">particularly dated</a> scene where the Doctor sees Nero running after the screaming and traumatised Barbara, smiles, and affectionately remarks "What an extraordinary fellow."

Part of the joke is that the rapist genuinely is attracted to the women and apparently sees nothing wrong with this, so it is structured like a soft love song... about having sex with unconscious women without their consent.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatMitchellAndWebbLook">That Mitchell and Webb Look</a></em> had a sketch where the cast of a community <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pantomime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pantomime">pantomime</a> are told they have to cut the scene where the Dame is raped by the Principal Boy, as the local council has decided it isn't "politically correct." The actors are unimpressed and argue that the rape scene is always the audience's favourite part of the show.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community">Community</a></em> has a recurring joke around Britta's past as she was molested by an "eager handed" man in a dinosaur suit in her 11th birthday. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> kicks in when you realize she wore a dinosaur costume to a Halloween party, possibly to deal with the trauma.

</div></li><li> Not to mention the fact that it's <em>very</em> strongly implied that Quagmire is a sex offender who frequently date-rapes women.
<ul><li> A throwaway line mentions that his favorite cocktail to offer a date is a "roofie colada"

</li><li> And in one episode, he says the line "I felt guilty once, but she woke up halfway through"
</li><li> Another episode uses a similar gag when the Griffins go to Quagmire's lake house. Peter sits in a chair as Lois flips a light switch.
