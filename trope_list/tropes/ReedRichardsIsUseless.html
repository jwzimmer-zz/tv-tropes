</p><p></p><ol><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted">To keep the world similar to the real world.</a> This is particularly common in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a>, superhero, or other series whose setting is superficially similar to the real world. Unlike, say, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> or <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>, one of the key draws of the series is that it could take place right outside the reader's window, which is lost if you make the fictional world <em>too</em> fantastic in comparison. This is particularly common in comic books, where major modifications to the world are only done to fictional locations, and often only to current levels of technology. <a class="urllink" href="http://generaleclectic123.blogspot.com/2010/08/marvelous-tales-remembering-mark.html">Here's a video of late Marvel editor-in-chief Mark Gruenwald explaining the reasons for this in some depth<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> To ensure that there's some level of drama in the story. If the super science or magic can literally do <em>anything</em>, then there's no reason the heroes can't just figure out a creative way to get them out of any jam. Goodbye potential conflict. In the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, there were tons of things the replicators and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">transporters</a> should have been able to do which would have ruined the plot of half the episodes, necessitating a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum">Holding Back the Phlebotinum</a> to maintain drama. As well, it could very easily be that the technology itself has some limitations, as "It can do anything you can imagine" is quite a bold statement for anyone to make. Other times, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSuperheroMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisposableSuperheroMaker">Disposable Superhero Maker</a> is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">disposable</a> in the first place to avoid flooding the setting with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Superhero">superheroes</a>.
</li><li> To avoid trivializing real-life problems. If Mr. Fantastic actually does cure HIV in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse">Marvel Universe</a>, there will be plenty of real people still HIV-positive, and plenty of researchers still investing untold millions of dollars and work hours to fight HIV when they finish the comic. This can make creators wary of tackling such issues, as it can be considered insensitive to have such a heavy burden in real life be casually miracle-cured in fiction. Also, in the interest of representation, disabled people exist in universes where science should theoretically be able to cure their handicap. However, either the disability is so ingrained as a facet of the character's portrayal or curing them could be seen to detract from their mass-market appeal as someone that other disabled readers can relate to. This is probably why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">Professor X</a> always ends up back in the wheelchair after regaining use of his legs. One possible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> explanation is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepingTheHandicap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KeepingTheHandicap">they simply CHOSE to live with the disability</a> for whatever reason (for example, it gives them some advantages, or they feel it as a part of who they are). Similarly to point one, this is generally more of a concern if the world is supposed to reflect the real world closely; if it's explicitly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateHistory">Alternate History</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a>, or the future, then there's greater room to play with this without potentially causing offense.
</li><li> To keep multiple titles within a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SharedUniverse">Shared Universe</a> consistent with one-another; comic book universes would approach a new level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl">Continuity Snarl</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> if writers had to keep track of every published book in their universe for which major diseases/blights had been cured by the heroes and which ones weren't. Sometimes it's hard just to justify a side adventure going on during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrisisCrossover">Crisis Crossover</a>, which is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanStaysOutOfGotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupermanStaysOutOfGotham">Superman Stays Out of Gotham</a>.
</li><li> The technology does exist but is being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithholdingTheCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithholdingTheCure">actively kept out of the general public's hands</a>. Reed Richards, for example, has developed countless mundane inventions that would shut down entire industries overnight, leaving countless people out of work. As a result, companies often pay him millions <em>not</em> to put his gadgets on the market. In addition, many super-scientists have a problem with having their life's work fall into the hands of the military or other people who they consider to have less than good uses for it (see: Alfred Nobel and the creation of dynamite, which was a safer alternative to nitroglycerin in mining - but also safer for military usage)
</li><li> The character may simply not be interested in mass production. In the real world, any sort of new medical device has to undergo years of rigorous testing to prove that it is both safe and effective before it can become available to the general public. Other inventions may have other concerns; your miniaturized nuclear reactor or tiny batteries have to be demonstrated to be safe and that they won't catch on fire, explode, or undergo a deadly meltdown. A character may simply lack interest in dealing with the bureaucracy involved, and may not trust anyone else to bring their products to market on their behalf. Especially given that half of the major corporations in these worlds seem to be run by villains.
</li><li> The technology itself and/or its components are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">Awesome, but Impractical</a>, at least in regards to mass-production and/or maintenance. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtanium">Unobtanium</a> needed to make the device work is too expensive and/or rare for it to be mass produced: a suit of impenetrable super-metal armor might be a great idea for equipping soldiers with, but if that single suit represents 80% of the known stockpile of the metal and cost more than an aircraft carrier, it's not something that can really be issued to the troops. Additionally, it's exceedingly dangerous, difficult and/or expensive to get a hold of (such as extraterrestrial materials or exotic states of matter that require millions of dollars to produce and maintain). Often overlaps with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTechIsNotCheap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewTechIsNotCheap">New Tech Is Not Cheap</a>, as while the fancy new phlebotinum can be produced in enough quantities for a single gadget-using hero to use, it can't be cheaply mass-produced for the masses yet.
</li><li> Related to the above, the lack of reasonable infrastructure needed to mass-produce the items, techniques, etc. It's likely many of the wonderous inventions and/or technology require large amounts of complicated parts and pieces that need to be assembled and handled in certain and specialized methods for it to be built and functioned properly; all of which requires a lot of time, finances, material, equipment, skilled labor and logistics for, something that humanity (or whatever race) lack the economic and or technological infrastructure in regards to mass production/maintanance. Sure you can have a design for an awesome spaceship, but the amount of raw materials, processing equipment, skilled workers and logistics to create one would be a a massive undertaking that only a global superpower (nation or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NGOSuperpower">otherwise</a>) could even try with a reasonable chance of success. For an entire fleet, it would be a project that only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetaryNation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetaryNation">Planetary Nation</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWorldOrder">One World Order</a> could do so on a practical level and reasonable chance of success than a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MulticulturalAlienPlanet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MulticulturalAlienPlanet">Multicultural Alien Planet</a> of varying powers with different goals, agendas and alliances.
</li><li> The inventors or creators are often too busy dealing with more immediate emergencies or dangers by supervillains, especially those who use their brilliance for their own selfish ends or for dangerous ideas. Sure it would be nice to be able to tackle some large-scale issues, but it's hard to think about that when you have to save a bunch of people or stop a mad genius from using <em>their</em> smarts from hurting others.
</li><li> It just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OccamsRazor">didn't come to the creator's mind</a>.
</li></ol><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>This trope is often associated with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticAesop">Fantastic Aesop</a> that these problems don't have easy solutions in the real world, and any proposed sci-fi solutions will have negative side-effects or potential for abuse that justifies completely abandoning all hope of trying to solve the problem. However, during times when superhero comics especially begin to explore the ramifications of their characters on real-world settings more closely, this question is raised and addressed more frequently. It is sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> as making people "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingOutForAHero">too dependent</a>" on superheroes: good thing that Jonas Salk didn't feel that way.
</p><p>Smaller-scale continuities such as newly-created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperHero">Super Hero</a> universes with a single author to explore the fictional world in 1 or 2 titles are more likely to avert and examine the concept of super-technology's effect on modern society, especially if the writer is trying to make a geopolitical statement. Larger superhero continuities, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelComics">Marvel Comics</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DCComics">DC Comics</a>, are established to have upheld this trope as their Earths have been explored in extensive detail. The trope can be inverted by having a hero "inventing" a technological revolution that already exists (for example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateUniverse">Ultimate Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a> apparently invented the MP3 player).

And yes, we have seen him use these clones to do visits to people while he's stuck at his desk. But ummmm, why doesn't he use them to do paperwork? Even ten of him could help sign off on forms, or stamp things, while the main one makes the executive decisions. Instead, these mountains of paperwork grow over the serious, until by this point they consume his entire schedule and he has to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> miss Himawari's birthday by having his shadow clone fail.</span> This is less a profit motive, though, and more a "avoiding overtime" motive. With his clones, he can have more family time and even have a more personal role as Hokage, but instead he uses about one clone, and just to attend meetings or media interviews.
<ul><li> It should be noted that the Shadow Clone jutsu, when dispelled, will cause the memories of the clone to go to the user.

<h2><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">DC Universe</a>:</h2>
<ul><li> The biggest examples of this trope in DC, or even comics in general, have to be Johnny Thunder and his successor, Jakeem. Here are two guys who had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGeniesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGeniesAreDifferent">Genie</a> at their command, with no limitations on the number of wishes, and they only ever used it to fight crime? There was a storyline where he started to feel bad that he wasn't doing more to solve people's non-crime-related problems and—against the advice of his elders in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JusticeSocietyOfAmerica">Justice Society</a>—he decided to start granting wishes for anyone who wanted his help. Lines formed around the block, near riots broke out if he tried to take a break; it soon occurred to him that if he kept it up, he would be spending the rest of his life granting other people's wishes 24/7 (hey, he can wish to not have to sleep, right?). The people waiting in line for wishes considered this an acceptable sacrifice; Jakeem, not so much.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> in general has often wrestled with the fact that he can't use his superpowers to simply force away wide-ranged problems plaguing humanity. Attempts to bring about world peace by disposing of nuclear weapons <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower">didn't fare too well</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanIVTheQuestForPeace">Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</a></em> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">the premiere</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em>. His attempt to cure starvation in poverty-stricken countries is detailed in the graphic novel "Peace On Earth". This results in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> being that these are things that will only be solved when all of humanity chooses to solve them. There are often short-lived <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverse">Alternate Universe</a> depictions of him going too far in forcing humanity to follow his ideals to solve these problems, thus becoming a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a>.
<ul><li> A famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBronzeAgeOfComicBooks">Bronze Age</a> story by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElliotSMaggin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElliotSMaggin">Elliot S! Maggin</a>, "Must There Be A Superman?" involves the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Guardians of the Universe</a> subtly hinting to Superman that there is a real danger of his doing too <em>much</em> for humanity, and stunting our society by making us too dependent on him; he sees the wisdom of it and reluctantly takes their advice to heart, resolving not to try and solve some problems people are better off fixing with their own two hands. The theme is revisited a few years later in "Superman's Day Of Destiny," when Destiny himself shows up to reiterate the point.
</li><li> It was revisited in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhoTookTheSuperOutOfSuperman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WhoTookTheSuperOutOfSuperman">Who Took the Super out of Superman?</a></em>, too. Tricked into believing he's undergoing some sort of psychological breakdown, Clark Kent commits himself to not be Superman for one week. He almost breaks his promise as soon as he stumbles upon an emergency, but the issue's swiftly and efficiently solved by the fire department, and Clark reminds himself that "the world always got along fine before there was a Superman".
</li><li> A similar point is brought up in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Elseworld">Elseworlds</a> story "Last Family of Krypton", where Superman's parents also escape Krypton's destruction. Jor-El uses his advanced knowledge to help humanity, but the Guardians point out that he's stifling human progress by making them reliant on him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JLAAvengers">JLA/Avengers</a></em>, Superman privately admits that he fears the JLA may be stunting humanity's growth and they're doing too much for the world. (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s fear is the opposite—that the Avengers can't do enough.)
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl">Supergirl</a> story arc <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl2005">Way of the World</a></em>, the titular heroine attempts to find a cure for cancer to save a little child's life. She refuses to listen when other heroes warn her that she is over her head and even their powers have their limits, and argue they should be more proactive, but ultimately she fails.

</div></li><li> Discussed when Lex Luthor dated Matrix. Lex noted that if Supergirl's shapeshifting molecules could be duplicated, then it would ruin the fashion industry.
</li><li> Also discussed and played cruelly straight prior to the start of the New 52. Superboy (Conner Kent) learns of Lex's sister, Lena, who is infected with a disease that rendered her almost a vegetable. Conner, who is hoping that the other half of his DNA has some good in him, gets Luthor out of jail and wants him to heal her. Luthor proceeds to do that, getting Conner to gather up various items to make a cure for the illness. He injects her with the cure and she's up and active for the first time in years. Just as she's celebrating, Luthor <em>immediately</em> reinfects her. To Conner's horror, Luthor gloats that he can do so many wonderful things, but while Superman is still alive, humanity will <em>never</em> get any of that. This finally forces Conner to accept that Luthor will never be good.

She doesn't want to receive special treatment and therefore dishonor public servants who were disabled in the line of duty; either a cure becomes available for everyone, or she stays in the chair.

Although a visitor from the future claimed his success led to him becoming a scientific hero on the level of Einstein, it never actually happened in the present day DCU.
</li><li> Stories set during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> explained why the superheroes didn't just Blitzkrieg into Berlin and end the war: Adolf Hitler had acquired <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PublicDomainArtifact">the Spear of Destiny</a>, which he could use to control any supernaturally-connected or magic-vulnerable superpowered being that entered the boundaries of the Reich (and the same was true of Imperial Japan and the Holy Grail). Since many of the Golden Age heavy hitters (Captain Marvel, Wonder Woman, Doctor Fate, the golden age Green Lantern, Superman, even Hawkman and Hawkgirl [reincarnated lovers bound by an ancient curse that had nothing to do with their powers]) fell into these categories, it limited the impact the heroes could have on the course of the war. Later, Hitler's belief in the Spear's power was discussed in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a> Unlimited</em>.

However, Swamp Thing states that if he would heal all of humanity's wounds, humans would further abuse the environment to maximize profit, knowing full well that Swamp Thing was there to correct all the mistakes.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSpectre">The Spectre</a></em> #7 (third series) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MadameXanadu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MadameXanadu">Madame Xanadu</a> asks the Spectre why he doesn't cure his HIV-positive friend Amy Beiterman. The Spectre responds that if he cures Amy, then there is nowhere to draw the line in curing the millions of sick people worldwide. At that point, the Spectre asks "Where do you draw the line? Abolish death itself?"
</li><li> Likewise, the Alan Scott <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Green Lantern</a> was outright terrified of his ring in a few continuities. In a <em>Batman: Black and White</em> story, he joins Batman in searching for a group of gangsters who nearly burned down the Gotham Broadcasting Building. In it, he effortlessly turns Batman invisible, travels back in time to save the gangsters (with zero timeline repercussions), uses the standard Green Lantern constructs, and more. He confesses that he eventually came to fear the sheer power of the ring, and that was the precise reason he abandoned Gotham — the city needs a hero... not a god.

</li><li> Bobo T. Chimpanzee (aka Detective Chimp) once got a hold of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorFate">Doctor Fate</a>'s helmet (and all of its mystic powers) and quickly pondered about using his newfound powers to solve all the world's problems. However, his powers also showed him the terrible after effects of such a change in the world's balance (for example, deleting a disease from existence would open the way for a newer, deadlier disease filling the gap). Eventually he gets rid of the helmet and uses his remaining powers to help people by solving as many unsolved crimes he could while his mystical powers last.

However, Smythe is so depressed with all the inhumanity in the world that he thinks about burning all his notes on the procedure.

</li><li> In the above-mentioned <em>JLA/Avengers</em> crossover, Superman notes how civilian technology in the Marvel Earth was substantially behind that of DC Earth. At the time of the story, Metropolis was a futuristic city built on Brainiac technology, a rare, non-handwaved example of this trope being inverted in the DC Universe (at least until it was undone in 2004).

<ul><li> Cyborg himself was a case of this, in the sense on robotic limbs being transplanted onto individuals and why it is not commonly available. Later issues address this by changing his backstory; the technology involved was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">Black Box</a> alien technology and so the specifics are very difficult to find out.

Dr. Yamakaze resents the Justice League, his wife died in a building collapse when she and others could be safely rescued by Justice League teleporter technology - which they refuse to share. So Yamakaze is doing research on making his own which he intends to release commercially. The Justice League actively oppose him and keep telling him to shut down the research, including Yamakaze's assistant Jason Rusch (the other half of Firestorm). Things happen and there's a teleporter mishap (because it was used on Firestorm - which it wasn't calibrated for), leading to the creation of the superhero Firebird and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Dr. Polaris (Yamakaze version)</a>.

At the end of the first story arc, after defeating a teleporting clone army of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick">Flying Bricks</a> from the island of Gamora, team leader Jenny Sparks states that the Authority is going to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">present Gamora's captured tissue replication and teleportation devices to UN inspectors</a>.

The Authority, like the Stormwatch superhumans, did devote their time to solving the problems of humanity, The Engineer in particular. She developed a cure for a certain strain of leukemia and spent her spare time developing renewable energy. Jack Hawksmoor led his endorsements to companies who promised to pay their workers a decent wage. The Authority are also pretty thorough about addressing the crimes perpetrated by humans rather than superhumans, such as totalitarian regimes. However, this backfires: they are accused of presenting "unfair competition" for medical and industrial companies, and blamed for mass redundancies. Moreover, after the "Coup D'Etat" storyline The Authority become the unelected government of the USA. In the process, the Authority unintentionally causes mass civilian casualties in fighting the armed resistance. Furthermore, the Authority unsuccessfully tries to legalize hemp production and require all auto engines to run on bio-diesel by the end of the year. Amidst these failures, the Authority steps down as unelected rulers of the United States.

His immediate reaction to every threat the movie throws at him after that is "hit it with my fists until it stops moving", so maybe that's his own fault.

A certified super-genius and one of the smartest people in the whole universe, he regularly invents mind-bending devices that tell physics where to shove it, but almost never devotes his considerable talents to anything other than superheroics. While Marvel has attempted to justify his lack of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">world-changiness</a> in various ways, including that his inventions are too expensive and that nobody else can understand them, the real reason is that allowing him to make a real difference would make the world far too different to reality. The justification being used in Jonathan Hickman's run on Fantastic Four and F.F. and by Bendis in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateMarvel">Ultimate Marvel</a> universe, is that it's his family which prevents Reed from putting all his efforts into changing the world. He has to choose between being a loving father and husband and devoting himself to advancing humanity (although why Reed can't take a middle ground has yet to be explained). It's implied that the world is <em>lucky</em> when Reed takes the first option since, if he doesn't or if things don't work out between him and Sue, he becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> (Hickman's books) or full on villain (the Ultimate 'verse).
<ul><li> Other justifications given (making this both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a>) is that while a lot of Reed's stuff does get patented, he avoids making a lot of dangerous superhero stuff like the death rays and portals to hell that can't be trusted to the general public available on the free market. Also, many companies pay him explicitly <strong>not</strong> to patent his stuff because they know they can't keep up with his inventions, which would put millions of people out of work. Writer Mark Waid, for instance, showed that Reed had developed a state of the art Personal Digital Assistant that would revolutionize the industry but he kept it for his own personal use thanks to a generous payment from Sony. He also had developed a cure for most forms of acne that Revlon was paying him to keep off the market. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UncannyAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/UncannyAvengers">Uncanny Avengers</a></em>, it's revealed that prior to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SecretWars2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SecretWars2015">apparent demise</a>, Reed had been involved in numerous lawsuits regarding the unauthorized use of advanced technology he'd been developing.

Being the bad guy, he hasn't released it. But Reed hasn't even tried to duplicate or reverse-engineer that project... and Reed not only knows about the device (it appeared in <em>Fantastic Four vs. X-Men</em>) Reed's had possession of Doom's castle at least twice since that story arc. This gizmo appears to have been derived from Battleworld technologies that can revive people to full health so long as any remote spark of life still exists in their body, which makes the lack of creation of similar technology by Richards look even worse by comparison.

</li><li> The fictional African nation of Wakanda is, due to a surreptitious abundance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">Unobtainium</a> as a natural resource, more advanced than even first world nations. This does not extend to any other part of Africa we see, though this is probably why writers don't show it very much, although to their credit from fairly early on they attempted to justify it by having the Wakandans have a policy of isolation that goes back centuries, due to a belief that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">The World Is Not Ready</a> and would only use their tech for evil. Fair, but that doesn't explain why they refuse to share non-harmful inventions. For example, the Wakandans have also cured cancer but are holding out on the rest of the world; when Captain Mar-Vell was dying of cancer, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackPanther">Wakandan King</a> was there and said he could do nothing due to the long term effects of Mar-Vell's nega-bands... but that still doesn't explain why Wakanda withholds its cancer cures from the rest of the world. During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeoffJohns">Geoff Johns</a>' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em> run, Black Panther and Iron Man were seen signing documents to allow portions of their tech to be shared with the world for the betterment of mankind; nothing ever came of this, and the documents were never mentioned again.
<ul><li> Regarding the cancer thing, the council discussing notes that if the rest of Earth really wanted to deal with cancer, they wouldn't sell items with carcinogens or something of the like. So they may think that the rest of the world could actually develop things like a cancer cure if they wanted to (at least regarding the macro-level.) Additionally, the reveal they did have a cure came a decade after Mar-Vell's death (and whether it would've worked in him, given he's an alien, especially a genetically-modified supersoldier).
</li></ul></li><li> During the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DarkReign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DarkReign">Dark Reign</a></em> storyline, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NormanOsborn">Norman Osborn</a> reveals that he has the cure for cancer, too.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a>'s webbing. Real life spider silk is, pound for pound, stronger than steel, tougher than Kevlar, as flexible as yarn, and incredibly lightweight. It's also prohibitively hard to manufacture, as spiders don't "farm" well. Peter Parker somehow has managed to manufacture synthetic spider silk that's cost-effective enough for him to always be in supply; while it does dissolve after about an hour, no adhesive company seems interested in buying the formula and tweaking it to last longer.
<ul><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersAcademy">Avengers Academy</a></em>: Spidey explains to the students in class how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbitionIsEvil">he was wrong for trying at first to use his powers for financial gain</a> instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatResponsibility">helping people</a> and the students ask why he didn't just patent his webbing and make millions that he could donate to needy charities. Spidey counters that he'd have to give up his secret identity to patent it, but one of them points out he could have used proxies in the form of shell companies to hide the source of the webbing<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3f0wv');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3f0wv" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3f0wv');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> It's justified for his youth since when he was starting his career as a hero he was a poor student without the money, connections or knowledge of business law to be able to pull it off. Now he rubs elbows with the likes of Tony Stark and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ImmortalIronFist">Danny Rand</a>, both highly competent businessmen</span>.
</li><li> He did once attempt to sell his webbing to an adhesive company early in the comics history, but they turned him down when it dissolved. He even tried to explain that he could tweak the formula to last longer, but they wouldn't hear it and sent him on his way.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4jqro');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4jqro" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4jqro');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. There are many, <em>many</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples of companies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWillNeverCatchOn">turning down brilliant inventions and product innovations (usually to be snapped up by a competitor) for really stupid, shortsighted reasons</a>. For example, Blockbuster refused to buy Netflix, a decision which would not only see the company that once offered to sell to them wiping them out, but wiping out their entire industry.</span>
</li><li> The film adaptations went three different ways with this: the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManTrilogy">Spider-Man Trilogy</a></em> averts it, with director Sam Raimi downright stating that organic web makes more sense than a teen discovering an industrial-strength adhesive; and as pointed out in the Film section below, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> makes the web <em>shooters</em> Peter's invention, but the MCU incarnation is more straightforward.
</li><li> The 9-11 attacks were a tricky issue to touch. On one side, it would seem unlikely to happen in a fantastic world with so many superheroes with fantastic powers who could have stopped things immediately; but on the other, a character so New-York centric could not simply go on with his wacky adventures as if nothing had happened. So yes, they made a special issue, and a pair of random people saw Spider-Man and asked him an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingQuestion">Armor-Piercing Question</a>: "Where were you? How could you let this happen?". His answer? None. He has no answer, no explanation, no excuse. "I have seen other worlds, other spaces, I have walked with gods and wept with angels. But to my shame I have no answers."
</li><li> Spidey himself lampshades this trope in an X-Men crossover when he points out to Sauron that if he's smart enough to rewrite people's DNA and turn them into dinosaurs, he could use the same technology to cure cancer.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Sauron</strong>: But I don't want to cure cancer. I want to turn people into dinosaurs.
</div><ul><li> Amazingly, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AllNewAllDifferentMarvel">All-New, All-Different Marvel</a></em> era, Peter is actually <em>averting</em> this trope via his Parker Industries. So far, we know that he's developed a watch that acts like a much more hi-tech iPhone which is incredibly popular around the world. This aversion is also present in the Horizon Labs period, where many of the inventions Parker creates to fight supervillains are turned to civilian use, like cryo-cubes for organ transport. He created the cryo-cube technology for use against Hydro-Man.
</li><li> In <em>Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man (2019)</em>, Peter learns that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTopicOfCancer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTopicOfCancer">Aunt May has cancer</a> and, lost in his grief and confusion, accidentally breaks a kid's arm when he gets him to stop stealing a car. When he takes the kid to Dr. Strange and begs him to heal him, he also tells Strange about Aunt May. Strange instantly recognizes this and cuts him off, telling him that there are things he should and should not do, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfDeprecation">suggests not taking up deals with interdimensional demons (which Peter agrees with)</a>, and that he should just accept the time Peter has left with her. As much as it hurts, Peter accepts.
</li></ul></li><li> This premise is partly explained by the Marvel Universe's Watchers' intention not to interfere in the affairs of other races. Their first attempt to help others involved them sharing their knowledge of the atom with a less advanced alien race. While most of the aliens used their newfound knowledge of nuclear energy for peace, some used it to create destructive nuclear weapons which led to a massive atomic war and then to an attack on a neighboring planet whose inhabitants managed to retaliate with their own nuclear missiles, leaving both worlds devastated and both civilizations in ruins, with a surviving member of the first race blaming the Watchers for giving them the knowledge before they were ready for it. This led the Watchers to being non-interventionists.
</li><li> Naturally, all of Marvel's brains turn up useless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotPlot">if the plotline calls for it</a>. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/OneMoreDay">One More Day</a></em>, none of Marvel's brains were able to prevent Aunt May's death (or remember the things which have healed much worse injuries). Including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a>, who (totally removed from his ability to alter the fabric of the universe at will, being the Sorcerer Supreme), was a <em>neurosurgeon.</em> Enter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil">Mephisto.</a> And at the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s run on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstonishingXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstonishingXMen">Astonishing X-Men</a></em>, Cyclops said that he had contacted Reed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Hank Pym</a> and the other brain trust members, who were unable to rescue Kitty from the giant bullet. In both cases, the writer wanted to set up a specific plot resolution which wouldn't have been possible if Reed Richards (and the other brains) weren't useless.
</li><li> The presence of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheInvaders">The Invaders</a> didn't make World War II turn out any differently, even though Cap punches out Hitler and Tojo on at least one cover along with the Invaders routinely decimating Axis forces. Nowadays it's assumed that those super-heroes mostly served to cancel out the efforts of the equally fantastic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a> and other Axis supervillains, resulting in a war that played out exactly as though neither of them had existed. Later on in the Marvel Universe, it was implied that the US did not use any superhuman soldiers in real-world wars, out of threat of retaliation from other nations' superhuman forces. It is worth mentioning that in <em>Dark Reign</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BuckyBarnes">Bucky</a> (the Captain America at the time) claims that he killed Adolf Hitler. The circumstances and consequences of this are never elaborated on.
</li><li> In <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8k-PHnfIe8">this video interview with Garth Ennis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the author says that one of the advantages of writing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelMAX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarvelMAX">the Max line</a> (separate from the regular Marvel Universe), is that if you have incredibly powerful super-beings then it makes many of the wars and events of the real world look unnecessary.
</li><li> In the case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Storm">Storm</a> and other characters with weather-manipulation powers, it's been suggested that continual use of their powers would destabilize weather patterns (as demonstrated in one battle between the X-Men and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight">Alpha Flight</a> where Shaman's blizzard spell wreaked havoc on the weather cycle). Most weather controllers aren't creating weather out of nothingness, they're manipulating the existing environment, and drawing resources such as airborne moisture towards one location simply draws those resources away from other areas in need.
</li><li> Project Pegasus, a division of the US Department of Energy devoted to discovering alternative energy resources, has a method of converting solid radioactive waste into harmless material. This invention alone should revolutionize nuclear power and earn billions of dollars. The ramifications of such technology among the world has yet to be explored.
</li><li> Unlike Oracle, no-one wonders why the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMen">X-Men</a>'s</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ProfessorX">Professor X</a> is still in a wheelchair. This is because he doesn't seem to really <em>care</em>. He was moved to a healthy clone body under highly unusual circumstances, but his spine was broken later. Originally, Professor X used his telepathy to prevent himself from feeling pain coming from his injured legs. This in turn, caused his clone body to receive the same injury. He hasn't been in a wheelchair for years, thanks to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">Blessed With Suck</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Cursed With Awesome</a>.
</li><li> In <em>X-Men Legacy</em> #242, Hellion, angrily, invokes this trope when, after witnessing many incredible events during his run with the X-Men, they are just trying to replace his lost hands with robotic hands instead of finding a way to grow new ones for him.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hellion</strong>: Seriously. We bring people back from the dead. FROM THE DEAD! So how hard can a pair of hands be?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/NewAvengers">New Avengers</a></em> # 9, some AIM agents stole some of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Wolverine">Wolverine</a>'s blood to manufacture bio-weapons. Iron Man then replied, "Do you realize how far we would advance as a technological species if we didn't have to put up with this every ten minutes?"
</li><li> The first arc of <em>Avengers Assemble</em> has the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GuardiansOfTheGalaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> explaining that were it not for the constant string of global crisis and superhuman-related catastrophes, Earth would be a much more advanced civilization. In effect, the superhero/supervillain dichotomy keeps humanity from reaching its true potential.
</li><li> Before he became the Sorcerer Supreme, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorStrange">Doctor Strange</a> was a brilliant yet arrogant neurosurgeon. When one charity approached him to help them cure a disease, Dr. Strange refused as there was little if any money involved.
</li><li> Toyed with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersVsXMen">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></em>, where the Phoenix-powered Phoenix Five (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Cyclops">Cyclops</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SubMariner">Namor</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Colossus">Colossus</a>, &amp; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IllyanaRasputin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IllyanaRasputin">Magik</a>) use their powers to make the world a better place by ending war, starvation, disease, etc. However, the Phoenix Five eventually let the power get to their heads, and their fellow Mutants ultimately turn on them. Furthermore, the Phoenix Five grow increasingly naive, such as Colossus, in wanting to make lives better for the whales, endows them with the ability to walk on land (forgetting that these sea mammals cannot breathe outside of water). Meanwhile, the members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIlluminati" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheIlluminati">The Illuminati</a> (which contains people like Reed Richards and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackBolt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackBolt">Black Bolt</a>) justify not getting involved in the conflict by stating that the X-Men might be right, and thus helping the Avengers defeat them could prevent a whole lot of good from being done.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquadronSupreme" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SquadronSupreme">Squadron Supreme</a> of Earth-712 did try to remake their world into a utopia with their powers and technology. The end result was a totalitarian dystopia, and the battle that finally forced the Squadron to acknowledge this resulted in the deaths of several members, as well as the deaths of some of those who fought against them.
</li><li> One of the biggest examples of this trope in the Marvel Universe if not superhero comics in general is the original Human Torch, a sentient superpowered android created in 1939 America. Never mind the countless scientific advances needed to create such a device, such creation had NO effect on consumer electronics technology. The android Human Torch was made up of synthetic flesh and not a machine, although once medicine reached the point of organ transplants it would have made the need for organ donation unnecessary and eliminate the need for waiting lists for organs.
</li><li> Lampshaded, and perhaps averted in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelNOW" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/MarvelNOW">Marvel NOW!</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">Indestructible Hulk</a></em> series, which opens with Bruce Banner lamenting the fact that all the years he spent trying to cure himself of the Hulk could have been used to fight problems like famine and disease. He then agrees to join <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SHIELD">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> on the condition that they give him funding to work towards bettering mankind while not in his Hulk form.
</li><li> A non-sensical attempt to justify this trope was given in Amazing Spider-Man 698. The titular character was with the Fantastic Four in an alien world. Spider-Man says how this world's superscience gives him plenty of things to invent for his job at Horizon labs. Reed Richards says that Earth's science must advance at its own, natural rate (whatever that means). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Of course, by that point, that was actually <em>Otto Octavius</em> inside Peter's mind...</span>
</li><li> Guardian (James Hudson) of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AlphaFlight">Alpha Flight</a> was originally a petrochemical engineer who developed his exoskeleton for mining purposes. Once he learned that his boss intended to sell his invention to the American military to be used as a weapon, he proceeded to destroy the plans, steal the prototype, and keep the control helmet for himself, as he'd created it at university. Hudson is then able to get the Canadian government on his side, and he went to work for the Ministry of Defence, leading to the creation of Alpha Flight.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersForever">Avengers Forever</a></em>. Humanity has so many inventions and resources that it could easily become a galactic empire, but it doesn't because Immortus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianOfTheMultiverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuardianOfTheMultiverse">Guardian of the Multiverse</a>, subtly influences everybody so that Earth remains at its present state.
</li><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/SuperiorSpiderMan">Superior Spider-Man</a></em>, the vigilante Cardiac breaks into the Boneyard, the warehouse where the confiscated weapons and gadgets of supervillains are stored. While searching for a specific item, Cardiac angrily states that all this technology should be out there making the world a better place, not wasting away on shelves. However, at one point one of Spidey's co-workers at Horizon Labs is concerned about all the time being spent on developing new weapons, and Spidey provides a list of all the revolutionary civilian applications his weapons offer, leaving the co-worker astonished.
</li><li> Originally, the Legacy Virus (a diseased specifically engineered to exterminate mutants) was created by writers as an analogy to the AIDS virus (which, according to a real-world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ConspiracyTheories">conspiracy theory</a>, was designed to exterminate homosexuals/drug users/people of African decent/communists/liberals/criminals/veterans/whatever else). The Legacy Virus was going to remain uncured until a real-life cure for AIDS was discovered. However, numerous fans complained that the inability of Marvel's supergeniuses to cure the Legacy Virus made them look incompetent, and Marvel decided to go back on its original decision.
</li><li> Back in the 90s, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DoctorOctopus">Doctor Octopus</a> attempted to cure the AIDS virus to save a former flame. However, Spidey thought he was trying to turn it into a superweapon after he stole a few vials of it. Octavius is able to hold off Spidey until his tests are complete, but when he finds out that they were a failure, he heartbreakingly shuts down and allows his defeat, befuddling Spidey immensely.

When Superpro points this out to the suit's creator, he explains that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">the superstrong materials needed to make it cost millions of dollars</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">making it totally impractical for mass production.</a>
</li><li> In one story of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers">The Avengers</a></em>, a group of Avengers enter a secret US Government facility in search for answers towards a mysterious contagion that started in Mount Rushmore. As they're looking through computers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AntMan">Scott Lang</a> finds out that only a few scientists knew the truth of what they were making, that the others thought they were making a cure for HIV and he sadly laments that, with so much money poured into it, they could have.
</li><li> In an issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OldManLogan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/OldManLogan">Old Man Logan</a></em>, Silver Samurai reveals that he possesses high-tech nanites that allow him to survive seemingly-fatal injuries. He then casually mentions that actually producing the nanites is far too expensive to market the tech to the public.
</li><li> Invoked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnstoppableWasp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UnstoppableWasp">Unstoppable Wasp</a></em>. When Nadia is in the throes of her first major mania episode, she starts writing notes down concerning people she knows, particularly her friends within G.I.R.L.. When one of those girls, Taina, catches sight of a note wanting to fix her cerebral palsy, she's furious that she thinks she really wants to "fix" that as that's a part of her and she has no right on what she should or shouldn't fix. It takes about a week and Nadia seeking help for the young heroine to confront Taina and admit that that wasn't her at all, but her bipolar disorder talking.

Namely, in that he declares war against the "world's leaders" or more specifically, the individuals and groups such as Dario Agger, the CEO of Roxxon (and a minotaur). According to Bruce, the reason people like Reed, Tony and Adam Brashear (Blue Marvel) have failed to make an impact is because of powerful people like Agger manipulating the world and thus Bruce takes it upon himself to tear down the establishment with the hopes of entrusting the younger folk to fix it.</span>

The trope was both averted <strong>and</strong> played straight, according to circumstances. That's because Reed Richards is usually useless in universes with steady and ongoing publications with no defined closing date; and he's usually <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateReedRichardsIsAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateReedRichardsIsAwesome">awesome</a> in alternate universes. Ultimate Marvel is a rare case of an alternate universe with ongoing publications during 15 real-world years.
<ul><li> Before Professor X and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Magneto">Magneto</a> founded the X-Men, they offered their mutants to help government/industry solve numerous problems (i.e. the energy crisis, ending world hunger etc.). Government/industry declines the offer, not wanting to upset the status quo.
</li><li> Upheld with the lack of superhuman involvement in political affairs. When the Ultimates assisted the US government in the overthrow of a rogue Middle Eastern regime, it resulted in an invasion force of a Chinese/Russian superhuman task force against the USA.
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UltimateFantasticFour">Ultimate Fantastic Four</a></em> with Reed Richards himself; the governmental think-tank he belongs to keeps him focused predominantly on military technology and restrains release of his successful creations. The frustration at not being able to change the world despite knowing his technology could provide incredible advances to humanity eventually drives Reed <em>insane</em>. So insane that he takes up the mantle of the now-deceased Ultimate Doctor Doom and becomes a supervillain known as the Maker, whose actions lead to the annihilation of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Germany and Asgard</span>. Furthermore, Reed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">then tried to turn Earth into a utopia whose plans included distributing free energy, the sentient seed, and blowing up the Iranian Parliament.</a> After that, he turns into a multiversal scale menace, reappearing in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretWars2015">Secret Wars (2015)</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheUltimates2015">The Ultimates (2015)</a></em>.

This is what happens when you combine all of fiction into one universe.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheBoys">The Boys</a></em>:
<ul><li> The superheroes, for the most part, really are useless. When The Seven try to avert the comics' version of 9/11, they fuck it up catastrophically <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">with the Brooklyn Bridge being destroyed instead of the south World Trade Tower</span>. The message being that the military and other trained rescue organizations are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRealHeroes">The Real Heroes</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In <em>The Boys</em>, the US military had shot down the airplanes heading for the Pentagon and North World Trade Center Tower, thus reducing the 9/11 death toll from over 3000 to around 1000.</span>
</li><li> A key subplot of the series is the repeated failure of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">Mega-Corp</a> Vought-American to avert this trope by making superheroes part of the US military. Their first attempt to deploy superheroes during World War 2 ended in all the superheroes dying in a Nazi ambush.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ExMachina">Ex Machina</a></em> plays with this trope. The main character is a former superhero who has the ability to talk to machines (so he could tell a train to stop itself, tell a computer to turn itself on, and tell a gun to jam itself). However, he hangs up his cape after he screws up a bit too much (plus the government specifically forbade him from doing any more superheroing while it was studying his gear). He only goes back to work <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">on 9/11, where he's not quite fast enough to stop the first plane, so one tower is still demolished (he saves the other one)</span>. He then decides to run for mayor of New York City, figuring he'll do more good in that role. For the most part, he's correct.
</li><li> An obscure Golden Age example. In Target Comics' "Calling 2R" feature, a benevolent scientist known only as Skipper transformed his estate into Boystate, a high-tech refuge for unwanted boys. Boystate residents possess a variety of high-speed aircraft (by 1940s standards), "force wall" forcefields, cosmic-ray-powered healing chambers, portable radio communicators and other nifty gadgetry. But while Skipper was very happy to share his technology with his charges, he went out of his way to make sure it never left Boystate's confines. The later stories averted it when World War II broke out and Skipper was ordered to develop high-tech weaponry for the army. He was happy to comply.
</li><li> Usually played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AstroCity">Astro City</a></em>, as the author believes that it's important that the stories take place in our world, but the superhero Samaritan was able to stop the Challenger disaster, and there's a story dealing with a lawyer who attempts to defend his client in a mundane case by citing superhuman events—he argues that yes, forty witnesses say that they saw his client commit the murder, but there was once a bank robbery seemingly committed by celebrities who turned out to be shapeshifters, the superheroes First Family were suspected of selling defense secrets, but it was their Alternate Universe counterparts, etc. It ends up actually getting his client off the hook.
<ul><li> The lawyer example actually went meta with this trope: While the lawyer was proud of mounting a successful defense he was also very worried about the legal precedent he was setting. The same lawyer (in his role as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narrator">narrator</a>, addressing a classroom some decades later) states that the aforementioned defense caused a major overhaul of legal praxis concerning suspected metahuman involvement and that there is no way that defense would fly in the comic's "present".
</li><li> Deconstructed in the Astro-Naut's story. Roy Virgil aka Astro-Naut developed many super-advanced inventions during his interplanetary adventures, but he refuses to share them with anyone because he's convinced that humanity is not ready for them yet (especially after encountering the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoDifferent">Mrevani</a>). The general public is <em>pissed</em> when they find out that he's hoarding futuristic technology from them—especially since the story is set at the start of World War II when said tech would've been invaluable to the Allies' war effort—causing their opinion of him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWithBadPublicity">plummet.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Qubit, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Irredeemable">Irredeemable</a></em>'s <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz">Captain Ersatz</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Reed Richards</a>/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">The Doctor</a>, invents and routinely employs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWormholesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWormholesAreDifferent">teleportals</a> to travel around the Earth and to other planets in an instant. He is, however, fiercely protective of the technology, and his fears are proven justified when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufficientlyAdvancedAlien">Vespa</a> weaponize the technology and use it to stop the Plutonian:
<div class="indent"><strong>Qubit</strong>: I'm as flattered as Einstein was when he saw Hiroshima.
</div></li><li> At the end of David Hine's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Spawn">Spawn</a>: Armageddon</em> storyline, Spawn is recreating the universe after the cataclysmic battle between heaven and hell. When Spawn is asked if he wants to cure the common cold or end global warming, Spawn says no, for he has done enough for humanity and it is now time for them to solve their own problems.
</li><li> Played with in <em>The Uniques</em>. The eponymous super-beings played a major role in all of their world's events since they emerged in the late 1930s, but in the end, no matter how many divergences they created, the end results weren't that different from the real world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JudgeDredd">Judge Dredd</a></em>, the availability of superscience to the public varies from storyline to storyline. In some issues, organ theft/traficking are major crime operations. In other issues, hospitals regularly provide cloned organ transplantations to patients (thus making organ theft/traficking redundant). Human brains can be transplanted into humanoid robots in Mega-City One. However, the cheapest model is $120,000 and over 90% of Mega-City One's residents are on permanent welfare.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupremePower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupremePower">Supreme Power</a>: Nighthawk vs. Hyperion</em>, Nighthawk lures Hyperion to Darfur in hopes that Hyperion will become more proactive on the country's suffering. Hyperion kills Sudanese President Al-Hamas, although the disposed President assures Hyperion that another brutal ruler will just replace him. The story ends with superpowered Africans ordering the titular characters to leave, saying that two people can't fix a country of millions of people.
</li><li> Gyro Gearloose from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse">Disney Ducks Comic Universe</a>. Over the course of time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">the many different writers</a> did let him invent <em>anything</em>, from simple mechanical contraptions which could theoretically also work in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness">ultra-soft science fiction stuff</a> like e.g. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeMachine">Time Machines</a>. In spite of all this, Duckburg does always stay at the contemporary tech level. Same thing applies to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MickeyMouseComicUniverse">Mickey Mouse Comic Universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a>, Doc Static.
<ul><li> A subset is that, sometimes even without Gyro, the world is frequently shown to have the capacity for advanced space travel, and even encountering alien civilisations is not too hard. Yet <em>scientists</em> never make any use of this technology to, you know, study space — if there's ever a plot involving scientists' efforts to send anything to space, they're likely to be suddenly back on the "Mars rover" level of technology. Something of the same thing applies with time machines, although it's averted in the stories where Professor Zapotec sends Mickey and Goofy to study the past with a time machine.
</li><li> Scrooge himself also qualifies. Given the fact he might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fiction500">the richest character in all of fiction</a>, his funding alone could pretty much solve all the world's problems. A pity he's cheap.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>Sultry Teenage Super-Foxes</em>, the US military develops an "alchemy ray", which they test by turning dog poop into gold... and then the head scientist remarks that it's considered "too theoretical" for them to get more funding. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Linkara</a> flips out at this, pointing out that such a device is <strong>infinitely</strong> useful since it could be used to safely dispose of nuclear waste (among other uses). The machine is destroyed in the accident that creates the titular heroes, rendering the whole debate moot.
</li><li> Another <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/AtopTheFourthWall">Atop the Fourth Wall</a></em> episode: Linkara asks why the scientist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BruteForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BruteForce">Brute Force</a></em> (who can grant human intelligence to animals and create transforming battle suits) doesn't use this technology to benefit people in wheelchairs.
</li><li> In the graphic novel <em>The Network</em> (which was about a television network devoted exclusively to covering superhero news) one of the news headlines explained "The heroes have the ability to end poverty and hunger. So why don't they? Find out in an exclusive interview with the Champion."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Asterix">Asterix</a></em> plays with this trope. There is a Gaulish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndefeatableLittleVillage">Undefeatable Little Village</a> that the Romans cannot conquer, because their local druid Getafix created a magic potion that gives super-strength. However, it is not produced on industrial levels to simply remove the Romans from all Gaul and undo Caesar's conquest, or even to take the fight to Rome at all, because Getafix only allows its use for defensive purposes, and will not reveal the recipe to anyone (or, more exactly, only to another druid that would also keep the secret, but that never actually happened). And, besides, that would ruin the tone of the comic book, which is a comedy. On the other hand, the magic potion and the main characters have had many <em>small</em> effects on the world here and there, mostly of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeethovenWasAnAlienSpy">Beethoven Was an Alien Spy</a> variety, such as the broken nose of the Sphinx.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ArchieComicsSonicTheHedgehog">Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em>:
<ul><li> Deconstructed in with Knuckles' ancestors, the Brotherhood of Guardians. They had the most advanced technology on Mobius, combined with potent mystical prowess and powerful allies. At no point did they try and stop Dr. Robotnik during his original decade long spree of terror, even when he was a clear threat to them, only getting involved in areas of echidna interests. It's suggested that their obsession with following their centuries-old traditions was the problem, with even their allies calling them out on it, saying that echidnas would become a footnote in Mobian history, whereas they could usher in a golden age if they got involved with other races. When Dr. Robotnik returned, now as Dr. Eggman, Princess Sally asked them for help, but they refused because she couldn't agree to using their most advanced weapons, suggested to be nuclear. Since an early issue in the Knuckles comic book established that echidnas <em>do</em> have the tech to fully restore an ecosystem ravaged by nuclear weapons, this wouldn't be too big a problem, but they never mentioned this to Sally makes it seem like they withheld that knowledge just to make her leave. Eventually Dr. Eggman caught up to their tech enough to attack them directly, getting most of the echidnas slaughtered, and the Brotherhood captured.
</li><li> Another interesting aspect is roboticization. When the process was created by Sonic's Uncle Chuck, it was meant to save people who were dying until a way to save them was found. However, Robotnik found the thing, altered it and when Sonic's parents became the first two victims, Uncle Chuck fell into despair and retired in shame, not knowing that it was altered. Years later, an alien race called the Bern came to Mobius, abducted all of the roboticized Mobians and reverted them back to normal... then it turned out that it was <em>banned</em> after a testing on a techno-organic species <em>killed them off</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PS238" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/PS238">PS238</a></em>:
<ul><li> A side-story explores the logical extension of this trope, with NASA outsourcing the design of their new space rocket to Herschel Clay, a metahuman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> with a love of tinkering. Problem is, by the time their own engineers have had a chance to try to comprehend his designs Clay has already found a way to improve it. In other words, they get a new design in the mail that becomes obsolete by the time they're ready to take that one off the drawing board, and so on: They simply can't keep up with his constant improvements.
</li><li> <em>PS238</em> also averts this trope with the Rainmaker Project, a section of the school where students with powers that don't lend themselves well to combat are trained on how to use them in civilian life, like a kid with the ability to turn anything into food being trained to turn things like rocks into nutritious but low calorie diet foods that tasted like high quality chocolate. It's also shown that many superhumans use their powers in a variety of ways for the civilian sector; the previously mentioned Herschel, for example, has his own company that apparently produces a large number of superscience inventions for everyday life.
</li></ul></li><li> While being mostly on par with real life, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Diabolik">Diabolik</a></em> has a few technologies like that:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> with the various attempts from good guys to reproduce the title character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LatexPerfection">plastic masks</a>, as only Diabolik knows how to prevent them from melting. In fact, attempts at reproducing them drove one scientist <em>insane</em>.
</li><li> One episode had a character discover part of the formula of Diabolik's masks. Knowing the potential for this discovery, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">he promptly ran to his boss to tell him</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubversion">And got arrested for another crime before he could tell him</a>. When he got out of jail he <em>did</em> use his knowledge to make a device that detected those masks... But did not give it to the police, he instead sold his services to a shady private eye, resulting in them getting ultimately murdered by Diabolik to preserve his advantage.
<ul><li> His nephew later found the blueprints, and gave them to the police immediately. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It was actually a trap of Diabolik.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The government of Clerville has a design for a revolutionary miniaturized laser, but it's not used. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified</a> by the fact it needs a ruby of almost unnatural purity, and Diabolik, after stealing the laser's blueprint, also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPlansNoPrototypeNoBackup">stole the only copy of the formula to purify rubies to that level</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> A major theme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AtomicRobo">Atomic Robo</a></em>. The comic is set in a world where crazy pulp sci-fi and fantasy concepts coexist comfortably with the mundaneness of real life. This is a world where Nikola Tesla built a sapient robot, said robot runs a major scientific corporation, giant monsters and supervillains are regular nuisances, and more. And yet ultimately the world <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpiteOfANail">really isn't that different</a>. The global tech level is largely the same, as is cultural development, and generally it feels like the real world except there just <em>happens</em> to be robots and death rays flying around. As the comic goes on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">Robo struggles more and more with a sense that he's failing to accomplish any meaningful change and that he's having time he could spend on actual science wasted by the constant pulp adventures him and his friends are being dragged into</a>.
<ul><li> This really reaches its zenith when Robo discovers that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> after Tesla died, the government confiscated all his unfinished research and rather than using it to further science in general, they wasted it on trying to win the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ColdWar">Cold War</a>. Which ended up petering out exactly like it did in real life, meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">they pissed away Tesla's life work for no reason</a></span>. When Robo learns this, he practically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">goes catatonic</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent">"<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker">You could've helped them</a>..."

Though a couple thefts against Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer, he and Samuel Sterns manage to create a slightly less efficient arc reactor which they then patent and sell to companies all over the world, solving the world's energy crisis. Alongside Noah Burstein and Mason Phineas, they also create a functional cure for Alzheimers (requiring only a shot every couple years) and a fountain of youth that de-ages an eighty year old woman forty years in half an hour (it can go further but they worried her body wouldn't be able to handle the strain). Even though both products are years away from being marketed due to FDA regulations, they're still held as outright heroes to the masses. While less groundbreaking, they also use the same method that made Luke Cage (and Michael himself) bulletproof on cow hide to make cheap bulletproof vests for the NYPD.

Rather than flying around stopping accidents and robberies, wouldn't he make a far greater contribution to humanity if he just used that technology, to, say, cure cancer? Looks like Luthor was right about him: "Gods are selfish beings who fly around in little red capes and don't share their power with mankind." (Not that Lex has any room to talk, as he squanders all manner of advanced technology on attempts to kill Superman.) Jor-El orders him to not interfere in human history, giving reasons like over-reliance from humanity and making a target out of his loved ones. And the one time he tried a direct approach was in <em>Superman 4</em>, the lesson here apparently that trying to force humanity forward will result in people trying to capitalize on your attempts.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>:
<ul><li> Effectively averted in this particular continuity. Technology in this universe is more advanced than the real-life standard, with reverse engineering of alien technology immediately approved for study. Sure, anything too dangerous is locked away in a lab for further study, but <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaCivilWar">Captain America: Civil War</a></em> has Tony unveiling new hologram-based technology designed for therapeutic purposes.
</li><li> Justified with all of Arnim Zola's laser weapons that were invented during World War II but never seemed to enter circulation or change technology as we know it in any meaningful way. While they were years ahead of even <em>our</em> time, let alone the 1940s, they also are powered by batteries which are charged by drawing power from the Tesseract. Without access to that your shiny laser gun becomes a useless movie prop as soon as it runs out of juice. It's later revealed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em> that the folks who had the Tesseract <em>did</em> keep the weapons and put them to use, albeit strictly in an experimental capacity as they still didn't wholly understand what the artifact was truly capable of yet.
</li><li> Those who found the Tesseract, S.H.I.E.L.D., managed to create some incredible things, such as advanced aircraft (Quinjets) and a flying aircraft carrier (Helicarrier), yet remain keeping that tech for themselves. They also decided that to research the cube, they could use the help of actual government agencies, namely NASA and the Air Force - and as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainMarvel2019">Captain Marvel (2019)</a></em> revealed, by the 1980s this resulted in an experimental faster-than-light engine, though once the prototype exploded (or rather, was shot down by aliens - the same species that the lead scientist of the project had defected from) they never attempted to go this path again, no matter the potential.
</li><li> Discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">Iron Man</a></em>. Tony Stark's power cell is stated as being able to generate 3 gigajoules per second of energy — which is 3 gigawatts of power generation. This is about as much power as produced by the largest man-made nuclear reactor and about 15 times the power of a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. The movie makes it clear that the Arc Reactor is incredibly valuable, and Obadiah Stane wants to use it for profit, but Tony is adamant that the technology stays in his hands and <em>his alone</em>, because he's seen what happens when his technology ends up in unsupervised hands. Stane is livid at one of his scientists for being unable to recreate the miniaturized arc reactor since Tony could do it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">in a cave, with a box of scraps</a>, and the scientist can only admit that neither he nor anyone else has Tony's know-how to be able to do so—it's simply beyond their abilities.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012">The Avengers</a></em>, Tony shows that he is preparing to spread his Arc Reactor technology around the globe, but on his terms. There's also his newly completed Stark Tower, a revolutionary "green" skyscraper which has self-sufficient power generation, even providing a surplus to the city.
</li><li> His father Howard also has this problem. Leaving aside the arc reactor, he also, as shown in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainAmericaTheFirstAvenger">Captain America: The First Avenger</a></em>, invented an anti-gravity device in <em>1942</em>. Sure, he hadn't worked all the kinks out, but he had a freaking <em>anti-gravity device</em> three years before the invention of the A-bomb. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AgentsOfSHIELD">Agent Coulson</a> gets to make use of it.</span> One theory is that the anti-grav device was actually the prototype of Stark Industries' repulsor tech.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersAgeOfUltron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></em> gives us a subversion in that Tony's desire not to be Useless leads him to mess with things he doesn't fully understand, resulting in the creation of a genocidal AI. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note5kluk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note5kluk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note5kluk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> To complicate matters, the problem he was trying to fix was Earth's lack of defenses against alien invaders. That's a bit beyond the "everyday" problems this trope normally implies. Granted, if "alien invasion" ever became a likely scenario in real life, it would probably be a major priority for most </span>
</li><li> Spider-Man again is a teen who discovered a superstrong adhesive to use as his webbing. Though this time another person at least manages to duplicate it, given <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpiderManHomecoming">Spider-Man: Homecoming</a></em> shows that Tony Stark created special Spidey suits that generate the web and can even shoot it in different ways.
</li><li> Justified and discussed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackPanther2018">Black Panther</a></em>. Justified when it is stated that Wakanda doesn't send its tech to the world as they think it will cause war. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This is proven right when Killmonger gets control and starts sending weapons to war dogs in other countries.</span> However, many characters think that Wakanda would be able to provide aid and technology on an unprecedented scale, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">which is what it starts doing at the end of the film</span>.
</li><li> Possibly the ultimate throw-away version is presented in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> when one of the failed attempts at the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> time machine</span> turns out to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">age people up to geezers or down to babies.</span> It's treated as a pure failure rather than <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the key to immortality</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuture">Back to the Future</a></em>: That 1.21 jigowatt nuclear reactor in the back of the car is an astonishing creation on all levels. To get that kind of energy output with current technology requires a huge reactor structure that costs hundreds of millions to build, while Doc Brown's reactor is about one cubic meter in size and he built it in his garage with the kind of resources a single well-to-do private citizen can muster. If this technology was allowed to spread, it would completely change the face of the global energy market. Even if you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> it by saying the reactor isn't suited for continuous energy production but it expends the whole fuel rod to give about ten seconds of electricity, that is remarkable for other reasons, such as being able to contain the rod without it melting its way through the bottom.z
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BruceAlmighty">Bruce Almighty</a></em>, not only is Bruce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">incredibly stupid</a> but he seems to have no desire to use God's power to make this a better world. His only attempt at this really involved more of "how can I get people to quit bothering me" and that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">handled so stupidly</a> it defies belief. However, the whole <em>point</em> of the movie is that Bruce is essentially not cut out to be God in the first place. A deleted scene would have justified this somewhat, with God showing Bruce the results of his reckless "grant everyone's prayers" policy. Some of the people Bruce "helped" would have been better off without it. For example, he made one kid who was bullied grow bigger, but had he remained small he would have grown up and used his experiences to become a poet whose work would inspire millions.

While they <em>do</em> use the technology they've created for personal profit, the game has them as licensed contractors for New York, and they ignore the potential profit they could make from developing that tech for other uses. One of the upgrades for one of the weapon modes in the video game sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> the use of the tech by saying that while it can punch small holes in the fabric of reality, the holes can't even be used to dump away trash.

While they <em>do</em> release some of the technology to the public, holding the patents on numerous alien technologies sold to the public — velcro, microwave ovens and CDs, to name a few — they are doing a great deal of constant memory erasing to hide alien existence to avoid possible panic. This is further shown in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MenInBlack">animated version</a>, where the MIB puts a waiting period on each piece of confiscated tech, which runs into centuries in some cases.

It's a teleporter! It's the most important invention in the world! And all you think about is <em>chocolate</em>!" That movie at least has the justification that Willy Wonka hated adults and seeing as teleporters would belong in the hands of adults, he wouldn't have wanted to share. Of course, given what happens to Mike after he tries to prove he's right, you can't really blame Wonka for not using it to teleport people. In the book the "meal from gum" candy actually <em>was</em> intended to end hunger, but Wonka says he hasn't perfected it yet. Given that it turns anyone who eats it into a blueberry, he's right not to market it yet.
<ul><li> Of course, the entire premise is that Wonka has become a recluse and refuses to allow others to see how his factory works as rival companies sent in spies to steal his recipes. He created the Golden Ticket tour to find a worthy heir, who can presumably change the company for the better as he finally allowed people to see his factory.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceCamp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpaceCamp">SpaceCamp</a></em> has a sentient, AI robot which is capable expressing emotions and bypassing failsafes to launch a shuttle, but NASA itself is still counting on the shuttle and mindless computers. The robot is too vulnerable to background radiation to be used in outer space or hazardous environments, and despite their best efforts they were unable to fix the design flaws. They keep the prototype around because they've already paid for it, but it's too delicate and temperamental to actually have any practical use as far as they're concerned.
</li><li> In defense of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TransformersFilmSeries">Transformers</a></em> series, Optimus Prime says explicitly that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAreNotReady">humanity is not ready</a> for the Autobots' advanced <em>weaponry</em>. The same is <em>not</em> said about the Autobots' <em>other</em> significant technologies, such as (apparently) FTL travel, mindblowingly advanced computer miniaturisation, robotics, and fabrication. This is particularly egregious since in the first film Simmonds <em>expressly</em> says that <em>much of humanity's</em> best 20th century technologies—from the CD player to the microwave to the internal combustion engine—derives from what they learned studying a trapped an <em>unconscious</em> Transformer. Imagine how far they could have pushed if they had a consenting friendly one around to fill in the gaps. In the fourth film, one tech company manages to get their hands on "Transformium", the stuff Transformers are made of. Except their version is the raw stuff, giving it far more shapeshifting capability. We see it taking shapes like children's toys and handguns and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their own Transformers which they lose control of in short order</span>—wait, maybe Optimus was more right than we thought. To be fair, though, the only reason <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they lose control of Galvatron is because Megatron downloaded himself into the new body</span>.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Darkman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Darkman">Darkman</a></em> film trilogy, the titular character has developed synthetic skin which can mimic the appearance of anyone's face for 90 minutes (after then, the skin then dissolves). The titular character is not satisfied with the invention until the synthetic skin is permanent and therefore has not released the technology to the public.
</li><li> The premise for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanTheMovie">Batman: The Movie</a></em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966">the Batman TV Series</a> is that that incarnation of Batman only is useful to fight supervillains (and nothing more). At the end of the movie, Batman quickly refuses Robin's idea to better the world by making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip">"Freaky Friday" Flip</a> with the United World Organization security council, arguing that they shouldn't try to tamper with the laws of mother nature. Then happens exactly that, (but arguably, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">Status Quo Is God</a> still applies) and Batman takes responsibility just before going out inconspicuously through the window.

</div></li><li> Alfred is constantly harping on this trope to Bruce throughout <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDarkKnightRises">The Dark Knight Rises</a></em>, pointing out that if he shared his innovations he could do as much or even more good in Gotham as he tries to as a masked vigilante. Somewhat subverted when a great deal of those innovations are stolen by Bane, including a fusion energy source Bruce had shelved for exactly the reasons it becomes used for. Additionally, the whole reason Bruce was able to get his hands on the tech is because a lot of it was in the "dead end" department, usually things deemed impractical or too costly for mass production. For example, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolCar">Tumbler</a>'s purpose was to jump rivers and build temporary bridges. They were able to get the jumping to work but not the bridge-building, so the project was scrapped. The advanced bodysuit was deemed too costly for equipping every single soldier with it. On the other hand, Bruce also has no right to take that stuff, as it belongs to his company and investors rather than him personally (although he does own, at least, a controlling interest in the company and it was started by his father). If it ever comes to light, then he'll be up on embezzlement charges <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note6yd6z');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note6yd6z" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note6yd6z');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A guy does indeed try to blackmail Bruce this way.

</li><li> In <em>Dungeon Master</em>, the main character has invented a pair of glasses that can control numerous electronic devices such as traffic lights, and ATM machines. He doesn't bother to market the invention (to be fair marketing a tool whose primary purpose is casually breaking laws <em>would</em> be a bit problematic, but then if he's capable of making something like that...), and remains stuck as a low-paid IT assistant.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingSpiderMan">The Amazing Spider-Man</a></em> averts the age-old complaint about why Peter Parker doesn't market his web formula. In this movie, he doesn't invent it; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">OsCorp owns the patent and manufactures the stuff, selling it, among other things, for use as light-weight emergency cabling</a>.

Later on, Axiel, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler">Battle Butler</a>, notes that Oreg is obviously trained as assassin. This fact is ignored for the rest of the novel, no assassination orders are given.

It never seems to occur to any wizard to ask, "Well, why not?" In the Muggle world, wizards could become simply one more category of useful, respected, highly-paid professionals... though admittedly it could go horribly wrong. The prejudice against so-called "witches" is implied but never reinforced by anything worse than domestic abuse the protagonist suffers from his relatives. In the modern day, this is true, but wizards are also stuck in the past, and they well remember the witch hunts of previous centuries. It's implied that they are afraid of another one, and judging from the stories of wise men and local healers one can find in the Middle Ages, they probably <em>did</em> assist Muggle civilization before the witch hunts and Statute of Secrecy. (It also doesn't hurt that, as Hermione points out in <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em> and again in <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTechbane">large concentrations of magic interfere with modern electronics</a>.)

And yet they generally remain aloof from political conflicts, even major wars, except for when magic users are already involved.

The Emperor of China witnessed a man flying by means of a bamboo-framed dragon kite, similar to a hang-glider.

When the inventor asked why, the Emperor explained that he feared this invention would be ultimately used by China's enemies to attack China. The Emperor admitted that he had no desire to kill the inventor, but felt that it was necessary to safeguard his people.

<ul><li> The Others do interfere with human affairs, but an elaborate system of mutual sanctions makes sure that interference isn't overt. The sanctions were set up to preserve the Balance, which, in turn, was established because open warfare between the Light Others and Dark Others left catastrophic casualties on both sides (and untold collateral damage).

</li><li> The great danger in <em>Final Watch</em> is a group of Others hiring human mercenaries and giving them enchanted weapons. Anton is a Light mage Beyond Categories (i.e. extremely powerful).

The <em>Oregon</em> flies the flag of Iran, since they have "cavalier" attitudes towards maritime law. There are several revolutionary technologies in the series that don't become available to the public because of this trope. <em>Valhalla Rising</em>, for instance, ends with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Pitt discovering a functioning teleporter</span>.

</li><li> For the majority of 'super-inventors' in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em>, their creations are actually an expression of their wild-card talent—the device doesn't work for others because it is really powered by their psychic abilities. It is mentioned that attempts to reverse engineer such 'inventions' often find things like apple cores, Klein bottles (which are impossible in a 3-dimensional space), and/or schematics of the desired circuits where the circuits should be.

If anyone else tries to build their designs, they won't work. In the second book, the team's Verne-type is said to be creating custom prosthesis for veterans and children in his spare time, so while they're not completely useless, they're of limited utility.
</li><li> A staple of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MichaelCrichton">Michael Crichton</a>'s books:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JurassicPark">Jurassic Park</a></em>, In-Gen has perfected ancient DNA extraction and cloning technology enough to resurrect species that have been extinct for dozens of millions of years. All they want to do with it is a zoo/theme park hybrid with living dinosaurs, and little is said about actual scientific study done with the animals. Some characters do point out that they can't be sure that these animals are correct recreations of the dinosaurs of old, and it is explicitly stated that 1) the dinosaurs have behavioral problems derived from being brought into a world where they don't have parental guidance (and humans have no way of replicating or supplanting it) and there is not an ecosystem they can be successfully introduced to since many other organisms their species evolved with are not available and 2) escaped dinosaurs might become invasive species in modern ecosystems that aren't prepared to regulate their numbers. None of these problems would exist if In-Gen just plain forgot about the dinosaurs and directed their efforts into resurrecting species that have been driven to extinction in recent times, whose original ecosystems continue to exist, just with their place in them currently vacant, and that could be raised in captivity by similar living species; and by being much more recent there would be more uncorrupted genetic material available and they could be cloned more easily and successfully. The first novel goes as far as saying that In-Gen's first success was cloning a quagga in the early 80s, but we never get word that quaggas were returned to the wild in their native South Africa.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Timeline">Timeline</a></em>, a corporation has invented both time travel (which, unlike in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFilmOfTheBook">The Film of the Book</a>, can take you to any place and any time, not just to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHundredYearsWar">The Hundred Years War</a> France) and a small, easily concealed universal translator headpiece. Their plan is to study life in past times and sell the information to theme parks trying to recreate them.

While an intelligent and learned man, the story takes place in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMiddleAges">The Middle Ages</a>, and so Ibn Fadlan does not realize the importance of his discovery.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>, the Aes Sedai's power is moderately addictive and reckless usage can lead to burning-out. Depending on the book and the writer (a lot of somewhat poorly-maintained continuity occurs in the world-building) many Aes Sedai do things like run around healing people and fixing mundane problems like assuring crop yields and preventing diplomatic spats from turning into wars with their magic. It's pretty much how they 'earn their keep' in terms of nobody deciding they'd be better off just killing the lot of them. It just has very little overall noticeable impact because they're extremely low on manpower (a couple hundred minor casters for an entire continent) and because they're all the magical version of illiterate children (they live only about half as long as it took their high-magic ancestors to learn the basics of the craft, and none of them can even construct the magical equivalent of the wheel).
</li><li> <em>The Modest Genius</em> by Vadim Shefner is about a brilliant but timid inventor whose greatness no one recognizes. It's occasionally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a>, when his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a>'s best friend keeps mentioning how ordinary the protagonist is and that she's looking for an "extraordinary man". She appears to find and marry one, and occasionally excitedly describes his new inventions. They're all horrible and needlessly complicated ideas, such as square spokes for bicycle wheels and a building-sized can opener. Meanwhile, the protagonist has developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">Artificial Gravity</a> (he keeps his desk on the ceiling to create extra space in the room), a camera that shows the future (he accidentally predicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>), a spray that allows one to walk on water, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">youth restoration device</a>, and many other <em>much</em> more useful inventions. He never sells any of them and destroys some for fear of misuse. Both his wife (who later leaves him for another man) and his son think he's a failure. He eventually reunites with his original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterests">Love Interest</a> (who left him after the same future-seeing camera showed him marrying another woman, thus creating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StableTimeLoop">Stable Time Loop</a>) when they're both well past their prime. He uses the above-mentioned youth device, the last of his inventions, to turn them both into their 20-something selves (that device is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeButImpractical">justifiably useless</a>, since it was shown to require the entire power output of the Sun just to restore them).
</li><li> Another novel by Shefner, <em>The man with five "No"'s, or the confession of the simple-hearted</em> (released in the US as <em>The Unman</em>), has the (not particularly remarkable) main character meet several inventors during his life. One of them is a man who accidentally develops a youth serum when working on a drug that would prevent someone from dying by falling from a window (inspired by his baby brother's death). The drug turns out to be useless for its original purpose, as it has to be taken minutes before falling. An unexpected side effect of taking it and falling (or jumping) out of a window is the more youthful appearance of the person. When the news leaks, dozens of people demand to use the serum. Eventually, stressed out from the unending stream of people seeking the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FountainOfYouth">Fountain of Youth</a>, he jumps out a window but forgets to take the drug (it is unclear whether the formula was lost, but it's not mass produced). Another person is a chemist who decides to help her father's liquor business. Inspired by the story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> turning water into wine, she resolves to re-create it using chemical means. She succeeds and makes a number of bottles whose insides are coated in special chemicals that, when filled with water and exposed to sunlight for a few hours, turn into the chosen alcoholic beverage. Much to her dismay, her father condemns the invention, claiming it will destroy his business, as a customer only needs to buy a single bottle to keep a never-ending supply of a particular drink. She ends up not selling any of the bottles and dies before the end of the story, taking the secret to her grave (although, admittedly, the invention did cause quite a bit of trouble in the two cases it did get out).
</li><li> For all their devotion to private enterprise and the profit motive, the heroes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AtlasShrugged">Atlas Shrugged</a></em> never bother much about making money, and nobody less than John Galt. He invents an engine that makes power from nowhere ("from static electricity," which is to say <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItRunsOnNonsensoleum">It Runs on Nonsensoleum</a>), but gets so annoyed at his employers' failed attempts to make the firm into a workers' co-operative that he walks away from his unfinished prototype and only builds one more, as the power plant for his mountain hideout. He also invents a large scale hologram projector that could revolutionise cinema and TV, and uses it to hide the Gulch from passing aircraft. Justified in-universe in great detail, and indeed the producers' reasons for withdrawing from the world and withholding their talents/inventions make up the central theme of the book. Even the title highlights their "going on strike" as the focus of the story.
</li><li> Whole premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MondayBeginsOnSaturday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MondayBeginsOnSaturday">Monday Begins on Saturday</a></em> is an aversion—it takes place in Soviet research facility, dedicated to sharing benefits of magic with mundane part of humanity. Some of projects include wide distribution of Living Water (bottled healing factor), creating solvents for grief and hatred, seeking the meaning of life etc. Though most of their real successes are mentioned off-screen, while book concentrates on hilarious failures and research process itself.
</li><li> In James Blish's story "Titan's Daughter," one of a race of persecuted genetically engineered superhumans discovers a non-Newtonian force, a thrust at a distance with no recoil. Obviously this has applications for everything from mining to flying cars, so he develops it industrially to become rich and powerful enough to help his fellow superhumans... No, of course not, that would be too simple. He uses it to build power armour so they can try to take over the USA.
</li><li> In Aleksandr Zarevin's <em>Lonely Gods of the Universe</em>, a teleportation device is developed independently by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAliens">Human Alien</a> on his homeworld and a modern-day human. However, neither tries to sell the device or use it for commercial applications. The alien, being a college student, tries to use it to stage a revolution on his home planet. His attempt eventually results in a nuclear war, with him and a dozen others being the only known survivors, as they manage to teleport to a planet they call Pearl, populated by primitive humanoids, not long before all hell breaks loose. Not surprisingly, "Pearl" turns out to be Bronze Age Earth, and the aliens (who accidentally become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless">The Ageless</a>) help jump-start the early Greek civilization and end up becoming responsible for any non-black hair color as well as both the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> and the story of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. Specifically, the part about the aliens helping the Atlanteans develop a powerful civilization with a strong navy averts this trope, and the inventor being unable to recreate the device on Earth is justified by the fact that he requires a key mineral that he is unable to find. His 20th century Russian counterpart is a young student who likes to tinker. Him and his friend end up going farther and accidentally invent a device that transports through both space <em>and</em> time. Naturally, they keep it to themselves and forget all about it until years later. They are eventually approached by the aliens (who've been living among us all this time) and hired to continue their work in a state-of-the-art lab. The aliens' main concern for the technology is to figure out how to use it to go back in time to Atlantis and warn their past selves about an impending cataclysm about to destroy the island. In the end, the protagonists realize that they're stuck in a time loop that threatens to unravel after several iterations, and they resolve to erase themselves from existence to survive (yeah, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeyWimeyBall">Timey-Wimey Ball</a> is involved) by preventing their own conceptions. It's not clear if the technology eventually ends up making it into public hands.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJagiLamplighter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LJagiLamplighter">L. Jagi Lamplighter</a>'s <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ProsperosDaughter">Prospero's Daughter</a></em> trilogy, the Order of Solomon ruthlessly stamps out all knowledge of powerful magic; Miranda and her siblings and father are effectively immortal, for instance. However, the <em>effect</em> is to invert this trope: once they no longer realize they can traffic with evil spirits for power, mankind turned to science instead. Which even produced better results for people in general. Similarly, the Unwary in her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RachelGriffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RachelGriffin">Rachel Griffin</a></em> series are kept ignorant of magic because their attempts to gain such magic for themselves can be disastrous.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SuperPowereds">Super Powereds</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Geniuses</a> have only recently been classified as Supers (after a criminal genius used a custom-made weapon to kill a Hero everyone thought invulnerable). While some try to use their skills to become Heroes or criminals, others opt to lead ordinary lives, trying to sell their inventions. The problem is that it isn't always easy to reverse-engineer them, so not all inventions end up being mass-produced by normal means.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PleaseDontTellMyParentsImASupervillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PleaseDontTellMyParentsImASupervillain">Please Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain</a></em>, Penny's father is a retired superhero with a brilliant mind. He spends a lot of his time trying to analyze inventions made by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a> to see if they have applications elsewhere. Penny's inventions are one-offs. She has no idea how they function or even how to repair them. In fact, the latter is an issue for most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Geniuses</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientists</a>. It's far easier for them to come up with a new invention than to try to fix one that's broken. Despite this, the level of science in this 'verse is noticeably higher than in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, implying that this trope isn't entirely averted.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JourneyToChaos">Journey to Chaos</a></em>: Tariatla is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy">Urban Fantasy</a> world and it is an aversion. Magic is used for many mundane problems which then creates a world that is both similar and different to contemporary real life. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ManaMutationMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ManaMutationMenace">Mana Mutation Menace</a></em>, this becomes a plot point. Eric (an otherworlder from "Threa", i.e. "Earth") talks about all the problems that plague his homeworld which Tariatla has conquered through magic. He does this to convince them to continue working towards a solution to their own magic-based problems, such as mana mutation, instead of a more drastic solution (like submission to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Order</a>). By the end of the book, they have indeed made progress.
</li><li> Generally averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillainsCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VillainsCode">Villains' Code</a></em>. The de facto leader of the League of Villainous Reformation, Doctor Mechaniacal, spends most of his time running his tech company, using his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> genius to make billions on his inventions. The "capes" have their own counterpart in the form of Professor Quantum, although he tends to spend most of his time in his own private island lab, so it's unclear if any of his inventions end up being sold to the public. The general tech level is roughly the same as in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>, though, so Mechaniacal's inventions must not be anything overly revolutionary.

<ul><li> Magician scientist Zelda Spellman tried to make a machine that would somehow, using de-ionization and <em>the Hanta virus,</em> process dirt into edible protein pellets and end the suffering of millions. When the first prototype blew up she became frustrated and quit trying, blaming her disinterest on a lack of electricity in the poorest areas.

<ul><li> The 4400s in general were supposed to have powers that could radically change the world to avert a futuristic catastrophe, but humanity's general fear &amp; paranoia kept this from going beyond isolated examples of killing specific people who would cause harm or fixing up a single neighborhood park. The whole "Ripple Effect" from the first season became something of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbortedArc">Aborted Arc</a>.
</li><li> Collier shows that his supers can use their powers for good by getting one of them to turn a square mile of the Sahara into wheat fields... and <strong>never does it again</strong>. The only message this should send to normals is that the 4400s <em>could</em> help you out, but they won't 'cause they don't give a shit.
</li><li> Collier's movement from Season 4 tried to avert this. He sectioned off an abandoned part of Seattle and his newly-empowered followers had powers that could fix many problems, such as a woman who could de-pollute a lake just by swimming in it. All the government heard was "Collier took a piece of land that technically belongs to us" and started a mini-war, ensuring that none of his improvements spread beyond that part of the city.

</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StargateVerse">Stargate-verse</a>:
<ul><li> While the series begins with 1995 people using 1995 technology, and the SGC really hadn't managed to collect much alien tech (let alone understand it), the end of the series has them in the possession of the full library of knowledge of two distinct intergalactic cultures, one of whom left <em>detailed replication instructions for everything</em>, and a bunch of alien allies and enough offworld colonies to solve every population problem (living space, famine, etc.) on Earth five times over. Getting public support would probably allow Earth to expand across the entire galaxy in the span of a few decades. While the later episodes indicate some of this tech is beginning to filter down (a prototype energy weapon, medical nanites in development, etc.), for the most part the government is unwilling to break the ruse since other groups consistently misuse the technology. It also helps that they're constantly in the middle of secret wars and probably don't want to reveal themselves at a "low point". They've also learned from the experience of one of their former allies, the Tollan, who shared their advanced technology with a neighboring world only to watch as that world destroyed itself, devastating the Tollan homeworld in the process. There's a good reason the SGC is introducing things slowly.
</li><li> There were two times that they met with an alien race called the Aschen, who offered to solve a massive part of Earth's problems, and the heroes were more than willing to go along with it. The Aschen were actually evil and intended to turn Earth into farmland to feed their own population, at which point the whole thing was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">conveniently reset</a> with time travel. Later, when their own technology went far beyond the Aschen, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> still remained the primary concern.
</li><li> One episode has Carter and Lee go to a public event showing off current advanced development. Their "inventions" include holographic technology (which they have already shown off to the world on live TV in an earlier episode) and a prototype plasma weapon. Lee laments how he is forced to deliberately show small, logical steps in development of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum">Imported Alien Phlebotinum</a> in order to make it plausible to the scientific community that advanced tech didn't simply appear out of thin air. They actually sabotage the plasma weapon in order to show a not-quite-finished design, until an alien bounty hunter tries to kill Carter (luckily, she was using a hologram). Carter and Lee then quickly adjust the plasma weapon to actually work, and she uses it to kill the assassin in front of hundreds of viewers.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowAndAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NowAndAgain">Now and Again</a></em>:
<ul><li> Dr. Morris and his team successfully created an artificial human body with superhuman strength and a nanotechnology-based <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, and then successfully transplanted a human brain into it. Any one of the solutions to the problems they had to have overcome to do this would revolutionize medicine; for example, a method for reconnecting nerves would end trauma-related paralysis by itself.
</li><li> The same goes for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">force field</a> technology demonstrated in one episode. Justified, as it is designed to be a missile shield and, so far, only works in a highly-ionized atmosphere (i.e. a thunderstorm), which can't be created on demand.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Heroes">Heroes</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> is so powerful and so intrinsic to an individual's cells that a single blood transfusion is shown to be able to cure a <em>bullet wound to the head</em>. There were at one point three main characters possessing this power (although admittedly one of them is a sociopath), yet neither them nor anyone else has even considered that they could save potentially thousands of lives <em>every single day</em>. Claire at one point <em>wants</em> to use her power for just this purpose, but is convinced otherwise by her father. However, during the eclipse Claire started dying because of an extremely large buildup of bacteria and viruses; apparently her powers prevent her from getting sick, but the high concentration of bacteria and such would certainly show up in any blood she donates, even if it wouldn't harm the recipient. An episode brought the idea back up to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">cure Hiro's brain tumor</span>, and Claire's offer was immediately shot down by her father because the regeneration factor would make him die <em>faster</em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Smallville">Smallville</a></em>, Clark Kent discovers that his blood can bring people back to life, but the revived people have to keep taking it every twelve hours or else they die, <em>for good</em>. And, being around kryptonite hastens the time limit. In addition, they come back increasingly psychotic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clark disposes of all the blood samples, deciding it isn't worth it.</span> In one episode it was subverted when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clark used his blood to revive Zod of all people, not only bringing him back to life, but also giving him/releasing his locked super powers. No 12 hours limit there—possibly due to Zod also being from Krypton? Way to go Clark</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>: Magic can (supposedly) only be used to bring people back to life if they die by supernatural means. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">So Buffy can be brought back after her death in season 5, but Joyce and Tara have no such luck</span>. The Urn of Osiris, that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">resurrected Buffy</span>, was also the only true way of bringing someone back from the dead, body and soul intact. When Willow acquired it, she was lucky, because that was the very last one, and it was smashed and defiled, so if it had been pieced back together it still would have been useless.
</li><li> As mentioned in the page intro, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> is rife with missed opportunities and blindness regarding the application of the technology available. There usually end up being more rationalizations and justifications as to why something <strong>doesn't</strong> do something useful than techo-babble about how it works in the first place. On the other hand, currency is unneeded, replicators can convert energy into matter to form nearly everything, planets are easily terraformed in a few decades, ships can travel between planets in a few days and across a galaxy in weeks. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekEnterprise">Star Trek: Enterprise</a></em> at least has the justification that any technology is bleeding edge so even technology common in the Original Series is barely tested.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries">Star Trek: The Original Series</a></em> had an episode involving a plant that could cure any disease, and regrow severed limbs. The characters work out how to reliably overcome the side effects by the end of the episode. The plant was conveniently forgotten in all future episodes.
</li><li> Similarly in the original series episode "Plato's Stepchildren", Bones manages to produce a serum using a mineral common on the planet of the week that gives people <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">telekinetic</a> powers. Despite the obvious utility something like this would have, it is never, ever, used again. The episode does attempt to justify it by showing what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkasses</a> the Platonians have become thanks to their reliance on those powers, and the one member of their society who is unable to develop the power naturally (and has been subsequently tortured by the others because of it) flat-out refuses to take McCoy's serum because he doesn't want to take the risk of becoming like them. Knowledge of the serum is taken with the crew, though solely to be used as a reminder to the Platonians that subsequent visitors will be able to duplicate it and won't be pushed around like the <em>Enterprise</em> crew were.
<ul><li> In yet another similar case, the Next Generation episode "Attached" introduces implants that give anyone that has them implanted telepathic ability with at least one other person, yet this extremely useful technology is not explored or even mentioned in any future Star Trek series despite the obvious numerous potential applications. This one has stronger footing than some others. It was created by a race hostile to the main characters as a means of involuntary brain download (something Starfleet understandably frowns upon). It also gets more than a passing mention that if two people use the device for too long their personalities, memories, ect start to bleed over. Additionally going more then a few meters from the other linked user is excruciating. A simple Vulcan mind meld would offer the same effects with less danger to the people involved.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></em> episode "Rascals", they accidentally discover the secret of eternal life (by turning four crewmembers into children via the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">transporter</a>, while they still retain their memory). No one ever tries to find out how that worked.
<ul><li> This also occurred in the second season episode "Unnatural Selection". After being artificially aged, the crew is able to revert Dr. Pulaski to her normal age using a DNA sample and the transporter. Ironically, earlier in the episode as she was experiencing accelerated aging, she commented that she was getting a better understanding of Geriatrics. Considering that they seem to have found a cure for old age this new understanding ought to be irrelevant.
</li></ul></li><li> The episode "Too Short A Season" where a Federation Admiral reveals that a legendary drug that reverses aging is entirely real, and it definitely works on humans.
<ul><li> After all these multiple instances of devices and drugs capable of reversing aging, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekInsurrection">somehow the entire plot of a movie</a> manages to revolve around the ethics of moving or killing an entire race of people just so the Federation can get their hands on particles that can do the same thing.
</li></ul></li><li> By the end of the episode "When The Bough Breaks", the crew of the Enterprise basically has unrestricted access to the technology of the super-advanced Aldean civilization. This includes a shield and cloaking device that can protect an entire planet and a repulsor beam that can hurl a starship light years away from it. Yet no evidence exists that they ever even bothered to take detailed scans of the technology, much less tried to duplicate it. These things would certainly have been <em>very</em> useful in the conflicts with the Borg and the Dominion. Though the power source for the equipment was far beyond anything the Federation had seen.
<ul><li> In the later episode "New Ground", the Federation is experimenting with the "soliton wave", a means of propelling a ship to warp speed without it having a warp drive. The technology is risky, and indeed proves dangerous. Throughout the episode the <em>Enterprise</em> crew remains conspicuously silent about the fact that they had a safe and reliable version of this kind of technology in their possession years earlier and never bothered to document and copy it.
</li></ul></li><li> Replicator technology. Every sophont and his dog seems to get it shortly after developing warp drive (it's a logical spin-off from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">transporter technology</a>, after all), and yet there are still traders who deal in small, easily portable, <em>mass-produced</em> items (which were probably made in a replicator in the first place). Artwork and particularly obscure substances/items a replicator can't (currently) produce make sense as trade goods, as do items too large to be produced by one, but given the ubiquity of replicators, the only reason that trading <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">self-sealing stem bolts</a> makes any sense is because the writers want a point of familiarity.
</li><li> In "A Fistful of Datas", Worf makes a timed-duration personal shield using a communicator badge and 19th-century stuff lying around. Nobody except the borg, kind-of, uses personal shields even though there's plenty of episodes where it would have been incredibly useful. This ends up getting averted, though, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline">Star Trek Online</a></em>.
</li><li> Interactions with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MirrorUniverse">Mirror Universe</a> tend to occur under anomalous conditions, and traveling back from whence one came is usually a matter of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOntologicalInertia">reversing a problem</a>. However, one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></em> sees Mirror!O'Brien abducting and returning Sisko to and from his universe, seemingly completely at will. Since this is possible, this poses the questions of why no regular avenue of transit is established between the two universes, and why the regular universe does not see an inundation of Mirror Universe refugees (given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a> status of humans there).
</li><li> In the much reviled <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Star Trek: Voyager</a></em> "Threshold", Tom Paris successfully creates a way to make vehicles reach Warp 10 which is explicitly described as <em>infinite speed</em>. It is then completely scrapped because it causes the unfortunate effect of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesJustAsMuchSenseInContext">turning people into salamanders</a>. No one points out the logical alternative of <em>slowing down the vehicle</em> before it reaches Warp 10, travel at the necessary speed to get back to the Alpha Quadrant and revolutionize galactic travel. If the salamander thing still maintains, they managed to successfully reverse it with no adverse effects!
</li><li> As to why Patrick Stewart (upon taking the role of Picard) didn't consider wearing a hairpiece to cover his baldness, he did consider that by the 24th century it's probable that they might have a cure to male pattern baldness. But then he immediately deduced that by the 24th century, they also probably wouldn't care even if they did. This assessment seems to make perfect sense to most viewers. Besides, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaldOfAwesome">Patrick Stewart looks dead sexy without hair.</a>

State universities offer courses in Galactic History and Mythology. And civilian technology remains exactly the same as real life, down to the four-wheeled road-bound fossil-fuel-powered internal-combustion-engine driven cars. Then again, it's implied that Ranger tech has a massive energy cost; you'd need the output of a nuclear power plant or more (like the megareactors seen in <em>In Space</em> and <em>Lightspeed Rescue</em>) just to field a five- or six-man team. Many of the Power Rangers' equipment, such as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinkets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinkets">Transformation Trinkets</a>, their weapons, their Zords and any other pieces of equipment appear to run off of a quasi-mystic bioelectric force/dimension known as the Morphing Grid and judging by the name, it only works for Power Rangers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters">Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters</a></em> has as its central premise the development of Enetron, a clean and renewable energy source that's completely supplanted fossil fuels and nuclear power...and by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ZyudenSentaiKyoryuger">the next series</a> it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">nowhere to be found</a>. This may be justified since <em>Go-Busters</em> takes place in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCalendar">Neo AD</a>", but the team has appeared in several crossovers and nobody batted an eyelash. Former <em>Power Rangers</em> writer Amit Bhaumik cited this as one of the potential reasons Saban passed on adapting <em>Go-Busters</em>; his rejected proposal <em>Power Rangers Cyber Corps</em> would have resolved this by setting the series on Mirinoi, the planet colonized at the end of <em>Lost Galaxy</em>. <br/><br/>In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersBeastMorphers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PowerRangersBeastMorphers">Power Rangers: Beast Morphers</a></em>, we're treated to Morph-X, a special clean and renewable energy source powered by the Morphing Grid. Yes, the same Morphing Grid that gives all of our heroes their powers. The mayor of Crystal Cove, Mayor Daniels, is not too thrilled at this prospect because of how many evil threats from throughout space and time have gone after the Rangers' powers and now they have a big target on their back. Grid Battleforce, on the other hand, uses their research and technology to try and make Morph-X-powered equipment useful. Regular cars are still used, however.
</li></ul></li><li> Invoked in a later episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Charmed1998">Charmed</a></em>, when Paige's newest romantic interest discovers the fact that she's a witch, and, upon parsing the reality that magic exists in the world, he wonders why the supposedly 'good' witches don't use their powers to better mankind. By the end of the episode, however, he understands the evil that also exists has to be held back by said witches.
</li><li> Government scientists in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSixMillionDollarMan">The Six Million Dollar Man</a></em> can make artificial limbs that not only look indistinguishable from the real thing, but outperform their biological equivalents by an order of magnitude. Yet none of this technology is ever used to restore amputees or paraplegics—they'd rather keep it all for a one-shot test pilot super-agent. Even their previous use of this technology (with Barney Miller/Hiller, the 7 Million Dollar Man) is something they sweep under the rug. A possible justification is that 6 million dollars in the 1970s is a lot of money, making these too prohibitively expensive to produce. The fact that Jaime Sommers nearly died when her body rejected her bionic implant and initially survived with amnesia and subconscious episodes of agonizing pain also likely mean the Food and Drug administration would never approve bionics wholesale implementation until satisfied that problem was solved.
<ul><li> The technology would also have uses outside of artificial limbs. Consider for instance the miniturized power sources contained in such limbs.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest">Person of Interest</a></em>. Lampshaded at the beginning of Season 2 when Finch (creator of a supercomputer which analyses all surveillance data in the country so as to predict threats against national security) is kidnapped by sociopathic hacker Root. Root realises that the true implication of the Machine is not its potential misuse as a tool of Big Brother—to successfully predict human actions, Finch has created <strong>the first true artificial general intelligence</strong>. Root can't believe that Finch's response to doing this was to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackBox">Black Box</a> the system and hand it over to a corrupt and power-hungry US government, and is determined to set the Machine free. By the end of season 3, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Decima Technologies, recognizing the power of the technology, has brought another AGI online in order to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOverTheWorld">Take Over the World</a></span>. The rest of the series explores just how dangerous that kind of technology can be if it falls into the wrong hands. When two AGIs go to war with each other, thousands of people die. Finch chose to severely limit the Machine's functionality after the first dozens of iterations all tried to kill him after being turned on.
</li><li> Used (sort of an inverted lampshade?) by Rimmer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>, who scoffs at the idea that Jesus can do all these magic tricks and <em>doesn't</em> go into show-business!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em> and its spin-offs repeatedly stress the idea that interfering in human history more than necessary will cause a lot more problems than it solves. Although touched on in the original series (as noted in the below examples), in 2005 the revived series introduced the phrase "fixed point in time" to describe moments that the Doctor cannot tamper with. (So, for example, he cannot prevent Hitler from starting the Second World War (despite another person attempting this in "Let's Kill Hitler"), or prevent 9/11.
<ul><li> In the William Hartnell era, full of 'pure historical' stories, much is made of how the Doctor is unwilling to change history, with virtually no justification given (especially as this only applies to events on Earth, and not other cultures). While this restriction is not explained, the other characters regard it as atrocious in-universe (particularly in "The Aztecs", where Barbara attempts to use time travel to end the Aztecs' human sacrifice, and "The Massacre", where Steven is outraged by the Doctor refusing to intervene in a genocide in France). Presumably, these are the fixed points that must happen, and which the later series discusses.
</li><li> The Pertwee era has a couple of stories ("The Green Death" and "Planet of the Spiders") which involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenRocks">Metebelis sapphire</a>, a stone capable of a variety of psychic effects including <em>curing mental disabilities</em>.

</li><li> At the start of "The Ark in Space" Harry suggests that the Doctor could sell the TARDIS technology and set it up in Trafalgar Square. The Doctor appears to view this idea as an insult and Sarah snaps at Harry for babbling.
</li><li> The Time Lords zealously guard time travel from falling into the hands of other species, though this one is half fears of the damage other species would cause and half the Time Lords being selfish pompous jackasses. Considering the way some people abuse time travel, this isn't entirely unjustified. The Doctor also relates one example of where the Time Lords tried to help a neighboring planet by giving it advanced technology-the Time Lords got "kicked out at gunpoint. Then they went to war with each other, learnt how to split the atom, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLastOfTheseIsNotLikeTheOthers">discovered the toothbrush</a> and finally split the planet."
</li><li> A more traditional example in "Dalek": Henry Van Statten discovers the cure for the common cold in alien bacteria but keeps it secret because there's more money to be made selling palliatives.
</li><li> The premise of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> book <em>Interference</em> is that the Doctor's metafictional constraints that prevent him intervening with real-world events make him useless. He spends most of the book being powerlessly tortured in a Saudi prison.

<ul><li> In contrast to thunder and lightning being made when The Count finishes counting, whenever Countess Dahling von Dahling finishes counting, it rains. She could very well use this ability to make it rain in places that need water, and indeed after her debut there are at least two episodes concerning a city-wide water shortage.
</li><li> In the direct-to-video <em>The Best of Elmo 2</em>, Elmo meets a Memory Bot, who is powered by other people's memories, and eventually learns to make its own memories. The robot's creator could very well invent other devices that run on memories.
</li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FraggleRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FraggleRock">Fraggle Rock</a></em>, Convincing John has the ability to convince anyone to do anything (even when they don't know it's him, such as in <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Secret Society of Poobahs</span>), yet he never thinks to convince the Gorgs into no longer being a threat to Fraggles, nor does Gobo think to have him go to "outer space" to convince Sprocket to not be his enemy.
</li><li> In an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sitcom">sitcom</a> example, the premise of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em> is about young, incredibly smart geniuses working at Caltech and their adventures trying to navigate a normal life. They have specialties ranging into high-end theoretical and experimental physics and are depicted as giving lectures, having papers published and even going on scientific expeditions but it is nothing truly groundbreaking or would make them celebrities. This is lampshaded by Leonard in the third episode, when Penny asked if anything was new in the physics world his response was a bemused "Nothing" and explained that all basic physics concepts have been in place since the 1930s and most of physics work today is basically advanced theories that can't be proven, only internally consistent. The show does break out of this on a few occasions, but most of these are things which, even if they are implemented, wouldn't be particularly notable:
<ul><li> Howard had been established early as being an engineer for NASA and designs the toilet on the International Space Station (which apparently had a design flaw they spent an episode trying to fix). This connection with NASA leads him to be chosen as a payload specialist for a new piece of tech going up, with him getting the opportunity to brag about actually being in space.
</li><li> Sheldon formulates the creation of a new superheavy element, which is initially confirmed by other research teams. This earns him some significant prestige at the university, but nothing exceptional or worldwide news. Humorously, he discovered his math was off (by a factor of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedADecimalPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedADecimalPoint">10,000</a></em>) and the discovery was a fluke, which infuriated him. But in a later episode Leonard manages to disprove the results and he actually didn't discover anything.
</li><li> When talking to Penny about his work, Leonard had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment">Eureka Moment</a> when it came to superfluid helium and interaction with the universe, and he partners up with Sheldon to flesh out the theory. Their idea quickly makes the rounds in the scientific community, praised by no less than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenHawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, and in swift order they start getting published in science journals and lecturing at other universities. This ended up being the longest and most well-developed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc">Story Arc</a> of the series, as Howard ended up suggesting a navigation system that would be possible based on their theories and they go in together with a patent. Said patent later catches the attention of the military and all three end up with a military contract to develop it. Once completed the military <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">let them go without ceremony</a>, although they later juggle offering other technology that could be developed based on their original idea.
</li><li> In the 12th and final season Sheldon and Amy develop a new physics theory "Super Asymmetry" and find themselves up for a Nobel Prize. Given the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork">general accuracy</a> of the math and science on the show, it ran straight into the problem of even a technical adviser not able to produce a genuinely award-worthy theory. The reactions of most physicists to questions about its validity have been at best a shrug.
</li></ul></li><li> Lampshaded in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LegendsOfTomorrow">Legends of Tomorrow</a></em>, where Thawne points out that Ray's dwarf star reactor could be used to cleanly power an entire city. Instead, Ray uses the technology to build himself the Atom suit, so he can play superhero. Even later, when he obtains enough of the alloy for a dozen suits, he still doesn't think to use the rest to help out humanity. This is despite the fact that he started out as a tech billionaire. Averted with Thawne himself in the world he creates using the Spear of Destiny. There, he is once again in charge of S.T.A.R. Labs (though with his own face and name this time) and is praised all over the world for helping to fix climate change, save the polar bears, and other global problems. True, he's still a murdering bastard, but at least he goes back to his roots of wanting to be the hero. Also averted in a Season 1 episode, where the Legends travel to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture">Bad Future</a> not long before Savage takes over and discover that Ray's Atom tech has been "appropriated" by his younger brother Sydney after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneToTheFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneToTheFuture">Ray's disappearance</a>, and Sydney's descendants have used it to build Atom-like robots that serve as the police force of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneNationUnderCopyright">Kasnia Conglomerate</a>, enforcing the board's totalitarian rule. Ray isn't happy about how his tech is misused.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>. Felicity was shot in the Season 4 midseason finale and left in a wheelchair. Within a few episodes, Curtis was able to use advanced technology to invent a chip that will allow her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">to walk again</a>. It apparently can't be reproduced, but the implications alone are staggering. The criticism this drew (see motivation 3 at the top of the page) from viewers and even the actress who plays Felicity demonstrates why this trope is usually played straight. Later on, Felicity and Curtis form a start-up with the specific goal of replicating the prototype and mass-producing it. Curtis even manages to make a similar chip to overcome the nerve damage in Diggle's hand. However, the falling out between the original Team Arrow and the new recruits may put an end to the start-up.
</li><li> Played straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014">The Flash</a></em>. Cisco and Caitlin are brilliant scientists, whose inventions can revolutionize the world, and yet they never bother to do anything with the tech that doesn't help Team Flash. Averted in the Flashpoint timeline, where Cisco is the richest man in the world, using his genius to run a tech company. Also averted on Earth 2, where "Harry" Wells has made great strides in technology by selling his inventions.
<ul><li> As an example, Cisco is the inventor of Captain Cold's gun, a device the size of a bulky handgun capable of producing a stream of <em>absolute zero</em>. To put into context how revolutionary this is, in 2001, a team of researchers were able to achieve 170nK, which is warmer than that, and won a <em>Nobel Prize</em>. Other inventions include handheld dimensional-portal creators, and goggles that induce lucid dreaming which leaves the dreamer able to communicate with people who are awake.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a> is chock-full of great inventions that could revolutionize whole industries, but some of the inventions have unintended side effects, while others are only used by Warehouse agents. This includes the Tesla-made <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StunGuns">Stun Guns</a>. Imagine issuing every cop a Tesla gun instead of a lethal weapon. The only side effect is short-term memory loss (i.e. the target doesn't remember the events immediately preceding being hit with a bolt). There's also Thomas Edison's Bioelectric Stagecoach, an old-fashioned car that runs off the miniscule bioelectricity produced by its passengers (rejected by Henry Ford in order to sell more replacement parts for regular cars).
</li><li> Averting this is the whole point of <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVisitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVisitor">The Visitor</a></em>, as the protagonist Adam fled back to Earth from the aliens, who had abducted him, in order to find inventors and help them spread their knowledge for the betterment of humankind. Unfortunately, not everyone is of the same mind, which includes his fellow abductees and the US military. For instance, the guy who invents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">anti-gravity</a> is put in a secret military prison, as the military claims his discovery is too dangerous, as it can be used to make black holes. Meanwhile, a scientist-farmer attempting to produce <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMatter">Anti Matter</a> instead figures out a way to grow crops incredibly quickly. Adam tells the man that he can single-handedly solve world hunger.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider">Knight Rider</a></em>: While the technology that Wilton Knight produced can be extremely dangerous (KARR, the times when someone has taken over KITT or used KITT's body), they are overlooking one important thing- Wilton Knight built a self-driving car. Build a normal car without the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">Molecular Bonded Shell</a> or the other gadgets his supercars have (like Turbo Boost or Microwave Jammer), maybe even dumb down the AI a bit (where the AI can still drive but it can't play trivia games). Now you have a vehicle that can drive itself with a 0% error rate and can take over driving if the operator cannot. Traffic accidents? Gone. Driver falls asleep at the wheel? No problem. Driver is intoxicated or is under the influence of drugs? The car can drive them home. It really flies in the face of "one man can make a difference" when fighting "criminals above the law" seeing as how KITT and Michael help just one person a week, when this technology can save hundreds <strong>every day</strong>. The only explanation why this occurs is when Devon explains to Michael that Wilton didn't allow his technology to be used is because some tech from Wilton had been stolen in the past.

In one episode, a throwaway line reveals that the machine has grown so sophisticated that the adventures no longer need to be programmed in: one merely needs to scan a book or even a painting to then experience its story in the Station. The Station's "death program" took Mr. Whittaker into a vision of Heaven so powerful that it nearly killed him, while causing the agnostic Eugene to experience an eternity of nothingness. What does he do with the Station? It sits at the back of his soda shop, where kids use it to experience Biblical and historical events. Even when people manage to steal the Imagination Station's technology—which people don't try to do nearly as often as you'd think—they repurpose it for such petty villainy as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalAdvertising" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubliminalAdvertising">Subliminal Advertising</a> rather than taking advantage of its unbelievable potential.

Often the story ends with the invention and the inventor destroyed. At other times, the trope is averted and the story ends with some suggestions for how the invention will affect the campaign.
</li><li> Mentioned explicitly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> with the "Gadgeteer" advantage, which allows characters to invent new gadgets more easily. While Gadgeteer allows characters to make gadgets for themselves or to solve problems that arise during an adventure, in order to sell their gadgets for money (or even outfit their teammates with gadgets) they must purchase additional advantages which cost more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterPoints">Character Points</a>. This is something of a truth-in-television version of the trope, as there is a big difference between prototype construction and actual profitable scale-up to mass production, and convincing investors that you've got the second set of skills is, realistically, yet another set of separate skills.
</li><li> This is a general rule for superhero gadgets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroSystem">Hero System</a></em> as well. Devices cost character points to have; while other people are allowed to borrow them once or twice, they can't keep one unless they pay the character point cost as well.
<ul><li> It is left open in both Hero System for 6th Edition and Champions for 6th Edition, with suggestions with how to handle it but not implicitly applied as hard rules. It even gives suggestions on letting players avert this.
</li><li> Averted in Aaron Allston's Strike Force and in the 6th Edition Strike Force reintroduced.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Aberrant">Aberrant</a></em>:
<ul><li> Both averted and played straight with "Project Utopia", dedicated to using the new superheroes for the betterment of humanity, including greening the Sahara, patching the hole in the ozone layer, getting rid of pollution, inventing new technology, toppling dictators, etc. However it is also dedicated to regulating technology, especially that created by those super-beings who are hyper-intelligent, and hiding away those it deems society can't handle. Naturally, there is a thriving black market for such technology as a result; the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a>, and in no small way Japan as a whole, make excellent profits that way.
</li><li> The Player's Guide provides options for keeping "super-science" from changing things excessively, providing those running games the means to enforce this trope as they see fit.
</li><li> Prequel game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Adventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Adventure">Adventure</a>!</em> also has super-science. In this case, only the Inspired, the pulp heroes of the setting (not to be confused with <em>Genius</em>'s Inspired, below), can create super-science inventions, but plenty of them are attempting to use said inventions to change the world. By canon, they largely fail; when the supers of <em>Aberrant</em> arrive on the scene, the world looks much the same as it does in our timeline.
</li><li> This gets changed somewhat in <em>Trinity Continuum</em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityReboot">Continuity Reboot</a> of <em>Adventure!</em> and <em>Aberrant</em>'s shared universe: the actions of past generations of heroes have resulted in a present day that looks like our own, but more optimistic, with more money in the space program and more environmentalism. However, it's also resulted in a secret history with scientific anomalies and causality issues.

<ul><li> This trope was played with in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/OldWorldOfDarkness">Old World of Darkness</a>. Spectacular changes like a Universal Translator or a superpowered healing magic were certainly available to player characters, especially in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>. However, they were prone to malfunction because the world was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">World Half Empty</a> running on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a> and humanity just didn't believe in the super-tech or old magic. Many supernaturals and human groups also had very good reasons to enforce the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a>, and would make sure any Reed Richards who drew too much attention was discredited and then buried in a shallow grave. However, using your power to make the world subtly better was certainly possible. Running around the hospital ward curing folks like a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> cleric was right out, but having a "health spa" that believably helped assuage sicknesses was possible. The Technocratic Union from Mage, in particular, were creating super-science and trickling it out to normal humans when "reality" could handle it, averting this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Not done with technology but with magic in most editions. Depending on the level of magic in a given campaign world, it may be hard to justify any famines, diseases, plagues, etc. An astute player may even realize with enough magic, it is possible to instantly transport goods an infinite distance every six seconds all day long, thus rendering ships, caravans, and the like impractical. Yet it seems most magic is only used to crawl through caves, kill ugly people, and take their stuff, while all the peasants can keep on dirt farming.
</li><li> Teleportation aside (as it is fairly powerful magic), less potent spells should eliminate all kinds of hazards. Even low-level curative magic should prevent folks from dying from anything which doesn't kill them outright. Remove Disease costs a low-level cleric nothing to cast and a few of them could essentially eliminate the danger of sickness in a community (especially if they understand triage). Furthermore, spell casters should be researching spells and making items which aren't related to dungeon-crawling to use in their mundane lives. However, since no player is going to get excited about "Ripen Crops II" and "Plowblade of Quick Tilling," they won't be in more recent (3.0 and later) editions. Earlier editions actually had such mundane magic from time to time.
</li><li> The third-party book <em>A Magical Medieval Society: Western Europe</em> was based entirely on averting this trope by describing how magic could be integrated into an agrarian society for the betterment of all, from daily use of low-level magic to annual shots of high-level spells.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Eberron">Eberron</a></em> did a lot of work both averting and justifying this trope. Magic has been industrialized and (partially thanks to a recent war) a lot of people have two or three levels in various classes, making low-level magic a lot more prevalent and regularly applied to improving daily life. However, high-level magic is still rare, with only a small number of people able to pull off the grand tricks like teleportation with any regularity—and most can only do it once a day or just aren't for hire. As a result, people are healthier and more productive, but shipping via teleportation is prohibitively expensive and actually <em>slower</em> for bulk cargo, so you have to rely on old-fashioned mundane means like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">magic trains</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>:
<ul><li> This is explicitly enforced by the Imperium (or more specifically the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MachineWorship">Adeptus Mechanicus</a>), declaring the invention of any new technology to be Heresy and focused only on recovering millenia-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">Lost Technology</a>. Furthermore, using Xeno technosorcery is strictly forbidden, and while that doesn't stop more wealthy/powerful individuals it isn't exactly helpful to the average human. (Of course, this only counts for the regular people, the low-level techpriests. The lords of Forgeworlds, more machine than man and 10,000 years old couldn't care less about rules on research.) This results in not only the technology of the Imperium as a whole remaining largely the same (or going <em>backwards</em> in some aspects), but also Feudal Worlds (technology similar to Renaissance Europe) and Feral Worlds (pre-agrarian) not advancing even if they've been in contact with the wider Imperium for millennia.
</li><li> The Corvus Jetbike in possession of the Dark Angels has been implied to be destroyed several times over, but always reappears no worse for wear. It is unknown if the Dark Angel Techmarines are just that skilled to repair the thing each time, if they have a whole storehouse full of them, or if they have some ancient STC that allows them to build more. Seeing as the jetbike mounts a <em>mobile plasma cannon</em> as opposed to the bolters of normal bikes, this would be a great boon to the other space marine chapters if the Dark Angels really can build more of them. But if they were to reveal it, not only might they lose access to it entirely (due to the heresy of hiding tech from the Adeptus Mechanicus) but their other secrets (such as the betrayal at Caliban) might be revealed, so they insist that there is only one, which is a relic and they've lost the knowledge to make more, despite all of the contrary.

<ul><li> In the sourcebook <em>Immortals</em>, this trope is justified with regard to the procedures used to keep the Patchwork People alive: the book acknowledges that these techniques would revolutionize health care across the world, but points out that they were developed through horrific experiments on unwilling subjects and require <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanResources">forcible extraction of necessary parts from live donors</a>. The doctors who developed them realize that if what they had done ever came to light, they'd be trying to outrun the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TorchesAndPitchforks">Torches and Pitchforks</a>, not stopping by Stockholm to pick up their Nobels. So they prefer to keep it a secret and sell their services to the rich and immoral.
</li><li> There are people who have found ways to use the various supernatural forces of the World of Darkness to further science, but rarity—whether of the supernaturals, or of the resources available to the researchers—prices such advances out of the reach of all but the wealthiest or most powerful. One such example is Last Dynasty Inc. from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse">Mummy: The Curse</a></em>, which has discovered that the mystical force known as Sekhem can be filtered into medication, producing steroids with no ill side effects and possible cures for cancer and HIV. The problem is that Sekhem can only be found in divine, immortal killing machines ringed by cultists, and the Relics said killing machines and cults are sworn to protect.
</li><li> This is part of why being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">mage</a> kind of sucks. You can change the world, such that it will never be the same again... and ten seconds after a Sleeper sees it the entire thing will come crashing down. Magic can't survive scrutiny by the nonmagical.
</li></ul></li><li> Being a superhero RPG, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MutantsAndMasterminds">Mutants &amp; Masterminds</a></em> can often turn into this. Given powers are scaled (logically enough) to value combat uses, a character could very well make 'world problem solver' a gimmick with a fairly light investment of points. In the first edition of the game the standard form of the Creation power could create any inanimate objects. Given the rate at which it can be used, even a low-level hero could probably have solved world hunger if they weren't off using it to make anvils over villains' heads. A liberal combination of Stretching, Gadgets and (depending on your opinion of him) Super Intelligence can result in you the player being Reed Richards. Subverting or playing the trope straight is up to you then.
</li><li> Palladium Books' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroesUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HeroesUnlimited">Heroes Unlimited</a></em>, being a superhero game largely based on the Silver Age of Comics, has no shortage of high-tech gadgets, as well as super-genius inventor types who can whip up new technological marvels with surprising speed. Books past the core establish that while some tech does make it to the public, there are a lot of stumbling blocks preventing a genuine technological revolution. In particular, there's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Alien Non-Interference Clause</a> preventing technology sharing with aliens (and the fallout of one character breaking that code created the entire <em>Century Station</em> sub-setting), a lot of supertech can't be mass-produced for various reasons, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp">corporate interests</a> strangle anything too advanced to maintain their own profit margins.
</li><li> Like 50% of all the abilities in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BleakWorld">Bleak World</a></em> involve some spectacular and easily created magic or technology, and yet the whole world is seemingly on the brink of destruction every seven seconds because of entirely mundane things.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ArsMagica">Ars Magica</a></em> is generally like the real-world Middle Ages despite the existence of the Gifted, and in particular, the magi of the Order of Hermes. The Order is mostly useless because of its own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienNonInterferenceClause">Alien Non-Interference Clause</a>, keeping it from becoming involved in wars or from driving technological development outside of the Order proper when that might be taken as "interference with mundanes." However, one later book in the line, <em>Transforming Mythic Europe</em>, gives ideas and examples of just how much change the Order might bring to Mythic Europe if they really tried, ranging from counterfeiting silver and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">Magitek</a> to creating a new island kingdom in the middle of the North Sea.
</li><li> Zigzagged with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WildTalents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WildTalents">Wild Talents</a></em>. The designers created it to be a superhero game that also makes use of alternate histories, placing emphasis on the ability of people with superpowers to shape the world around them, including the creation of fantastic technology. This is detailed in various pregenerated worlds, but not all of them follow the model. Worlds such as <em>Godlike</em> and <em>This Favored Land</em> both enforce this trope in different ways, resulting in histories that are the same as ours just weirder. <em>The World Gone Mad</em>, <em>The Kerberos Club</em>, and <em>Progenitor</em>, on the other hand, all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverseReedRichardsIsAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverseReedRichardsIsAwesome">avert this trope to the fullest</a>, creating wildly different histories from our own.

But they were so into testing all their inventions that they never marketed them publicly, instead marketing and shipping them to <em>themselves</em> for even <strong>more</strong> testing. It also doesn't help that they ignored even the most basic of safety standards, to the point where their facilities would have given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOSHACompliance">OSHA inspectors</a> a heart attack.

And since some of those ideas included "[Ethnicity] would be better off dead"...

However he never seems to have turned his skills on anything useful in the slightest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em> serves as a good example of why anachronistic world-reshaping technology isn't going to do anything good. An awful lot of inventions <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">come from insane epiphanies</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSparkOfGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSparkOfGenius">can't be reproduced</a>, most of them are dangerously unstable (e.g. most things remotely self-aware <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnedAgainstTheirMasters">try to maim their creators</a>), and many of them are built and used for the express purpose of destroying the inventions of rival mad scientists. Scientific miracles abound, but most of Europe seems to be stuck in a Dark Age most of the time. Commoners have little access to all the technological wonders but plenty of exposure to many technological horrors, and many see the Sparks as "witches" (you can't really blame them if you consider what a Spark can do), so even if Richard tried to be useful they would just give him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BurnTheWitch">Burn the Witch!</a> treatment.
<ul><li> Europe ended up dominated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> who mostly curbed the usual <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak">Control Freak</a> streak and got the special talent for... reverse engineering. Instead of building whole armies upon powerful, but one-gimmick inventions he found in his and others' crazy gadgets material for a few robust and mass-produceable systems and still had time for refining them. By the same token, found good use for a wild variety of monsters.
</li><li> Lampshaded when it's revealed that the people that actually keep everything running are the *minions* and not the sparks, with young Wulfenbach initially falling for the heroine in the course of trying to steal her on the assumption that she's a mechanically competent non-spark assistant, and later pretty much the entire cast of mad scientists fighting over the services of the one non-mad mechanic in the cast even harder than they defend their own lives. So even the mad scientists realize that dependability and steady competence are more generally useful than bouts of inspiration.

He hid it on Mars. Also, he lives on the moon and has a teleporter, and seemingly has some kind of immortality serum and/or time machine, since his castle is full of supposedly-dead famous people. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">He's not really good or evil</a> and rarely uses any of his technology for anyone else's sake.
<ul><li> This is also true of Doc himself, to an extent. He doesn't have much in the way of advanced technology, but he does have advanced degrees in dozens of fields (thanks to experimental cloning technology, which itself is an example since the only other thing he's used it for is to resurrect Ben Franklin) and rarely uses any of this vast knowledge. Instead, he runs a family-practice clinic and spends his free time emulating Batman.
</li><li> Doc's brother, "Dark Smoke Puncher," is a genius robot engineer who uses his skills solely to build attack-bots that patrol his family's territory, and occasionally engages in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodHacking">Hollywood Hacking</a> when supervillains come knocking.

Furthermore, magic in this universe is a self-keeping secret: if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade">masquerade</a> was broken, magic would alter its own rules so that very little worked the same as it had before, rendering old magic artifacts useless.

Ironically, the end of that episode actually sees Adam ranting <em>against</em> wizards sharing magic when the tricky subject of love potions comes up, since those would only serve to introduce mind control into normal society.
</li><li> Justified in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FineStructure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FineStructure">Fine Structure</a></em>, which makes this a plot point. Scientists would like to use The Script for teleportation and other discoveries, but they'll only work until the <em>the fundamental laws of the universe</em> are changed by Something so it can never be used again.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/SCPFoundation">SCP Foundation</a></em> could have changed the world with the SCPs... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">if they weren't so dangerous</a> and most of those that aren't are mostly used to help containing other SCPs.

<ul><li> Though the website has a very nebulous canon, some articles imply that the Foundation DOES use their technology to secretly help the world.

</li><li> Justified in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhateleyUniverse">Whateley Universe</a>, where there are two types of inventor mutants:
<ul><li> The first are Devisors, who warp reality slightly to allow for physically impossible inventions, which can then never be reproduced by anyone else (or sometimes even by them) and often don't even work for other people in the case of extremely impossible stuff. Some of them sell their tech, but since only a single person can produce it, it's generally extremely expensive and supply is very limited. This is averted in one case, with a devisor who can make... very good whiskey quite efficiently, and due to the way it works, can install a specific <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a> in brewing plants. Not changing the world, but it makes him VERY rich.
</li><li> The second are Gadgeteers, who have a variant of psionics that allow them to intuitively understand how to make things, but can't do anything that's impossible. Some of them have changed the world, but apparently being good at engineering leads to being incompetent at interpersonal relations, resulting in most of them getting ripped off by the companies they sell their inventions to and either not having the resources to do any inventing, being suppressed by people who don't want the world to change because a lack of that particular technology is profitable to them, or turning evil to get back at society.
</li><li> This trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope">mentioned by name</a> a couple times. Phase, in particular, is determined to change this state of affairs by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CutLexLuthorACheck">making sure that devisors and gadgeteers get a fair shake</a>, going so far as to offer to fund additional classes on basic economics and patent law aimed specifically at keeping genius inventors from getting screwed over. It comes up frequently in Loophole's stories because of the stuff she makes. Phase is so intent on getting Loophole on board with him because he can predict how her inventions will literally change the world. For example, her pet project is a restored Mustang that gets <em>double</em> gas mileage and 33% more horsepower. Phase is practically drooling over what an engine like that could do. If he knew about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMotionMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualMotionMachine">TAPS</a>, he would positively <em>freak out</em> at the possibilities.
<ul><li> The trope is played straight with the TAPS; Loophole refuses to patent it (which would require a full description of how it works in the patent application), because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorldIsNotReady">The World Is Not Ready</a>. As a free energy device built with Gadget tech, and small enough to install in a suit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a>, Elaine fears that publishing it would set off an arms race as governments and supervillains alike scramble to be the first to field an army which doesn't require complex logistics to keep fueled.
</li></ul></li><li> Note that these inventions and Devises <em>are</em> changing things, just not in ways most people would necessarily see all the time. Still, there are lunar bases owned by the US, Russia, and China; improved treatments for a number of deadly diseases and genetic conditions; and several other general benefits which are impacting everyone's lives. This is becoming more evident in the Gen 2 stories, set ten years after the first series, where holographic Virtual Assistants are commonplace among other things. On the other hand, there are also mass-produced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor">Powered Armor</a> and advanced weapons which aren't necessarily kept out of the hands of criminals and terrorists, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticDrug">exotic street drugs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CyberPunk">cybernetics that are available even to low-level street thugs</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapePunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CapePunk">several other down sides</a>. It hasn't changed quite as drastically as the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WildCards">Wild Cards</a></em> world, at least not in visible ways, but it is certain diverging from our own world rapidly.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WonderCityStories" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WonderCityStories">Wonder City Stories</a></em>, the Paranormal Invention Control Act means super tech cannot be sold to the public unless the government is satisfied that it cannot in any way be weaponized. Since this is just about impossible, super tech stays in the hands of inventors and their close associates.
</li><li> In the universe of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Worm">Worm</a></em>, several factors contribute to this:
<ul><li> The way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Tinker</a> powers work in the universe make it such a pain to make Tinker-tech compatible with mass production and maintainable by ordinary human beings that most Tinkers don't try. There are a handful of mass-produced Tinker products (such as the PRT's containment foam), but they are in the extreme minority.
</li><li> Every few months, massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kaiju">Kaiju</a> with superpowers emerge and attack a major population center, often resulting in millions of casualties. Most science and gadget heroes are understandably focused on this issue. There are strong suggestions that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Endbringers actually <em>target</em> people who try to avert this trope, as in the case of Mannequin</span>.
</li><li> As the nature of super powers are explored it is gradually revealed that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entities fueling them are hard-coded to seek conflict as part of their reproductive/evolutionary pattern. They subtly and sometimes overtly influence their host's minds to use their powers</span>.
</li><li> Accord, a supervillain, attempts to avert this trope using his superhuman planning skills—he has a plan that could end world hunger within twenty-three years—but generally fails due to his psychosis and the fact that nobody takes him seriously due to said psychosis.
</li><li> Panacea has the power to heal pretty much any disease or injury. She manifested this ability when she was 13 or 14 (she's about 16 at the start of the story) and spends a good chunk of her time going to hospitals and healing. She's constantly riddled with guilt about never doing enough, and is occasionally tempted to make a mistake to lessen the expectations on her—and then feels guilt about those temptations, leading her to loath herself and to irrationally resent those she heals, leading to greater guilt.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> This is at least partially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedTrope">enforced</a>, in that there is an entire suite of laws designed to make it as difficult as possible for parahumans to use their abilities for anything other than combat. The official purpose of these laws is to prevent unfair competition, the semi-secret purpose is to force parahumans to join the local <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutantDraftBoard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutantDraftBoard">Mutant Draft Board</a>.</span>

<ul><li> This is something of a pet peeve of Linkara's, as is chronicled in the comic book section. Regarding the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers">Trope Namer</a>, Linkara points out that Reed Richards seems too busy with inventing useless stuff like air signals that can change their own writing as opposed to something useful like curing cancer.
</li><li> In-universe, most of Linkara's own technological inventions can't be shared because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> they're not real inventions, just enchanted toys</span>. The real technology he possesses is mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plunder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plunder">spoils of war</a> and he doesn't trust anyone else with it — but he will deploy it on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">missions for the government</a> as long as the tech never leaves his hands.
</li></ul></li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoctorHorriblesSingAlongBlog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DoctorHorriblesSingAlongBlog">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a></em> invents a "freeze ray" which <em>stops time</em>, which he only thinks to use to defeat his arch-nemesis. He could preserve the lives of accident or disease victims until they can get help, prevent nuclear reactor meltdowns, revolutionize physics, or do any of a dozen other things, any one of which could raise enough money to produce a lot of the "social change" that he claims he wants. Justified in that he is a villain, and the social change he wants is closer to facism than socialism ("Anarchy, that I run!").
<ul><li> One of the prequel comics brings back the briefly mentioned hero Johnny Snow, who has a straighter form of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreezeRay">Freeze Ray</a>. Despite the numerous possible applications of the tech, he only uses it to fight crime.

Artifex is a Fartouched with the ability to simplify technology. It's explained that "he can take an existing piece of technology and make it half as big, twice as quick and three times as energy efficient." He uses his powers to make his factories just as efficient this way, so he can market his improved devices for the same price, for less materials and time required to make them. The National Farside Unit have him under contract to make armour, weapons and technology for themselves.

It can apparently fly anywhere in the world in a few hours at most without ever producing a sonic boom and is so simple to control that a teenager can operate it without any training whatsoever. Yet even when one of the antagonists builds an equally impossible super-aircraft that runs on smog and makes even more smog Gaea never once considers she could do more good with her own ubertech than she could by keeping it exclusive to the Planeteers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a>. It's suggested throughout the series that Professor Membrane's genius is the only thing actually sustaining what is otherwise a civilization in severe decline because it's populated entirely by morons/jackasses. Unfortunately, he only seems to create things that happen to interest him, and the fact that he's probably the most powerful and wealthy man in the entire world seems to mean absolutely nothing to him. He once created <em>perpetual energy</em>, then decided not to implement it after all (which was probably a good thing, considering what the rest of humanity could have done with it).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb">Phineas and Ferb</a></em> build interplanetary rockets, animal translation devices, and the like every morning. But they only do it to enjoy summer vacation. And by the time their mom gets home <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResetButton">everything is back to normal</a>. Although in the future episode it's implied Phineas has won the Nobel Prize and Ferb is at Camp David, so they presumably grow up to tackle more "serious" concerns.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, Dungeon Master grants one of the adventurers his powers. The newly uber-powered member uses his power to bring forth water for the thirsty teammates. Dungeon Master responds that by using the powers to generate that water, water from another area had to be deprived.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers">The Venture Bros.</a></em>:
<ul><li> Reed Richards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy">Expy</a> Richard Impossible is shown to be a sociopathic arm of the military-industrial complex, abandoning Dr. Venture in the arctic wilderness for entering a restricted area (something he being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> he is took more offense to than Venture flirting with his wife); later, he withholds alien technology, needed to save the world, that was left to Venture by his father, claiming it's because Venture is not responsible enough to have it (which is a quite reasonable argument) but most likely due to him wanting all the credit. In general, there's lots of other super-science doo dads floating around in the series that the general public never gets a chance with.
</li><li> Also lampshaded on occasion: in "Tag Sale, You're It!", one of the items in the titular sale is an actual lightsaber which Rusty couldn't sell because "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Kenner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Kenner">Kenner</a> wasn't interested in a toy that cost over two mill in parts alone and the Army told me "they don't sword fight anymore". To add insult to injury, the beam doesn't seem to cause any harm whatsoever.
</li><li> The show's creators have stated that this is part of the central premise of "failure" that permeates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">the Ventures' world</a>. Everything exists in a sort of "death of the jet-age" state where all the promises of technology have failed to deliver. Things like jetpacks, laser weapons, sentient AI, and magic all exist, but have proven to be too expensive, impractical, or dangerous to ever see general use. So the world mostly resembles our own, except you have all these obsessive weirdos around who use this stuff for crime or crime fighting, and it never sees wider applications. Some of the more "mundane" stuff, though, would be incredibly valuable—like HELPeR (a sentient, durable, dexterous robot assistant) and Billy Quizboy's fully functional mechanical arm. The former alone would make Dr. Venture a rich man again (the latter is revealed to have been designed by a madman who wasted his life obsessing with a girl he knew in college and getting posthumous revenge on his classmates).
<ul><li> HELPeR, at least, received additional justification in the Season 7 episode "The Inamorata Consequence": it's established that HELPeR robots <em>were</em> mass-produced and sold to the public by Jonas Venture, Sr., but an incident where an infant choked on a HELPeR robot's eye was blown way out of proportion by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> and they were destroyed in mass numbers with Rusty's HELPeR basically being the only one left.
</li></ul></li><li> The Season 7 episode "The Unicorn in Captivity" shows what happens when a truly disruptive super-science technology (in this case a matter transporter) is developed: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Office of Secret Intelligence</span> attempts to get hold of it to keep the status quo and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Given that they seem to have a standard procedure for dealing with such inventions it explains why many of them might never see the light of day. As they put it, if teleportation technology became available to the public, the entire transport industry would go belly up, along with Big Oil that supplies the fuel for those industries. It would cripple the economy beyond repair, and those same companies would not think twice about having something very bad happen to the device's inventor to prevent that from happening. As for the transporter, well <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> despite the OSI's efforts, it ends up in the hands of the Guild of Calamitous Intent after it was stolen by Monarch and 21 for a bit before Phineas Phage's attempts at teleporting went awry due to his mechanical augmentations and he's in a coma, discouraging further use.</span> Even with success, failure remains a core premise of the show.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents">The Fairly OddParents</a></em>:
<ul><li> Timmy never makes any sort of world-benefiting wish, like no discrimination, world peace, a cure for cancer, etc. While this could be justified in that he's a self-centered 10-year-old child and when he grows up all remnants of his fairies' magic will disappear, it seems implausible that he never thought to wish for something like this not even <em>once</em>. Timmy may have tried to do this once, or even more than once. The times he has wished for a situation to be better for someone other than him has blown up in his face.
</li><li> Chester, unlike Timmy, tries doing this after he's granted Norm, the temporary ex-genie, as his fairy godparent. Having a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackassGenie">Jackass Genie</a> as a fairy godparent predictably doesn't turn out well for him. When he wishes the deserts would have enough water for everyone to drink or make the ice caps warmer to make the penguins less chilly, he ends up flooding the deserts and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">causing global warming</a>.
</li><li> Lampshaded in an episode where Timmy's Muggle friends (such as Chester and his mom) have temporarily gained the knowledge that Timmy has had fairies all along. They ask the fairies if they could have granted Timmy any wish he wanted; Cosmo and Wanda reply that no, there are rules. However, they ask if Timmy could have done things like wish for easier housework for his mom, better living conditions for Chester, and so on; and Cosmo and Wanda reply that Da Rules would have allowed all of those things, and Timmy just didn't feel like wishing for their lives to be easier.
</li><li> Hilariously, it's shown that had he not been born, everyone's lives would have been far better off; Vicky, lacking a job, would have become a dentist's assistant, which means that her sadistic need to inflict pain would be put to good use. Same with Francis, who would have become a football star now that he had no one to bully. He also wouldn't have mucked up Crocker's childhood, allowing him to become a successful college professor (the spasms though seems to be genetically written into Crocker) and finally, a girl would have taken his place, making his parents incredibly wealthy with the movies she'd star in. In the end he still reverses the wish and brings himself back to the world, at the expense of everyone else (and, due to the status quo, never actually learns from this experience).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown">Xiaolin Showdown</a></em>, an item said to possess infinite power, and could solve any energy-related problem, is used to power a time machine. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">And that's where it's staying</a>.
</li><li> An episode of the <em>Michel Vaillant</em> animated series had the team participating in a special race for environmentally friendly vehicles only. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GadgeteerGenius">Gadgeteer Genius</a> mechanic builds a car that not only is pollutant free, but can actually <em>hover above the ground</em> via electromagnetism. Regardless of how much the thing cost, it would revolutionize transportation forever. Instead, it's used to win <em>that one race and is never seen again</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em>:
<ul><li> Homer's brother Herb became rich after inventing and selling a device that translates baby talk. After that episode, the device is never seen again.
</li><li> In "Treehouse of Horror XVII" a meteor with some living blob crashes into the Simpsons back yard. Lisa says how humanity could possibly learn about interplanetary transportation from the creature. Homer decides that it is more important to eat it.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult">Flame Keeper's Circle</a> wants to avert this by using alien technology to bring Earth into a golden age. Ben and the other Plumbers <em>enforce</em> this since introducing alien technology to a world that isn't ready for it is just a recipe for disaster. Julie tries to call out Ben (who uses a piece of powerful alien technology to make the universe a better place as a superhero) on the hypocrisy of this policy, but Ben points out that recklessly accelerating a planet's development via alien technology will usually lead to the planet's doom. Later episodes confirms it by revealing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Ascallon Sword, one of Azmuth's previous inventions, was once used by someone in an attempt to unify his planet ravaged by civil war... and ended up destroying said planet</span>.
</li><li> In the crossover episode between <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em>, Mandy believes that the KND could actually change the world, instead of fighting for small things "like the right to have cookies for dinner." Her idea is to use their resources to take over the world.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicSchoolBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMagicSchoolBus">The Magic School Bus</a></em> Ms. Frizzle could make ludicrously large piles of money working for, say, NASA. Just for starters, her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicBus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicBus">school bus</a> can travel from Earth to the Sun to Pluto and back in the space of a day, and comes stocked with spacesuits capable of withstanding the conditions on Venus.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ArchiesWeirdMysteries">Archie's Weird Mysteries</a></em>, Dilton invents some rather... advanced things. Why he's still in a public school is <em>beyond</em> anyone's guess.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius">The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius</a></em>, although Jimmy maintains and uses a plethora of superscience inventions and sometimes gives them away to friends and relatives, he never attempts to sell or mass-market them, even in episodes whose plots are driven by his lack of funds. He did attempt to mass-market the candy he made in one episode, using his town's citizens, but to say it ended poorly is an understatement. Hugh also sent a design of Jimmy's to the US government once and it nearly killed two people in the public test.
<ul><li> That said, Jimmy does have one creation that could benefit humanity that has no issues that couldn't be prevented with a little foresight: Goddard. With the exceptions of playing dead (exploding and reassembling himself) and him transforming into a giant, berserk mech from having a video game disk inserted in his disk drive, robotic dogs like Goddard would be extremely beneficial in service, search and rescue, and even simply being a pet for someone allergic to dogs. Jimmy wouldn't even need to give him up to make his design available to manufacturers, as he made Goddard all by himself.
</li><li> A large part may come from the fact that Jimmy is still only a pre-teen at most. When shown a glimpse into his (un-changed) future, he has won every Nobel Prize, so it's clear it's just a matter of maturity.
</li><li> Furthermore, other episodes show there is some higher technology, but just not implemented as of yet to the widescale.
</li></ul></li><li> Dexter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> (and his rival Mandark) is in the same boat as Jimmy, though in his case he's something of an egotist that pursues science purely for his own satisfaction. Also there's the fact that, unlike Jimmy, Dexter is determined to keep his lab and inventions a secret from his parents, and selling his inventions could potentially blow the secret. That said, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EgoTrip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EgoTrip">Ego Trip</a></em> reveals that in the future, an adult Dexter did start using his science to work for a corporation, only for Mandark to take over said corporation by stealing his ideas and later take over the world. But after Mandark (or rather, 4 of him) was defeated, Dexter would go on to use his science to evolve the entire human race to possess seemingly superhuman intelligence, creates an insanely high-tech utopia (with tech that puts much of what he's made in his childhood to shame), and becomes revered as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Big Good</a> to all of Earth for all of his deeds</span>.
<ul><li> There is one episode where he thinks he's going to die that shows him creating world peace and ending world hunger. Of course, this doesn't mean much to the show's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NegativeContinuity">Negative Continuity</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallaceAndGromit">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a></em>: Wallace has quite a bit of mechanical aptitude, having built, presumably using the means available to the average person, a rocket that can fly to the moon and back and a pair of trousers that can move on their own (which could have several applications such as allowing paraplegics to walk). Yet these inventions don't seem to affect the world around them all that much, nor does Wallace use them to make himself any money (the plot of "The Wrong Trousers" is kicked off by him having to rent a room out to pay bills).
<ul><li> The trousers are NASA surplus. Wallace ordered them in order to paint a ceiling.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em>'s cartoon "The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay">Ambiguously Gay</a> Duo", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGenius">Evil Genius</a> Bighead has invented lots of inventions that could easily defeat or hinder the titular heroes. However, he's more obsessed with using his inventions to try to out and prove the heroes Ace and Gary are gay. His fellow villains call out on him for wasting his talent for something so trivial since most of them don't care about the duo's sexuality.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RickAndMorty">Rick and Morty</a></em>, Rick is a near-textbook example, with being possibly the smartest creature in the universe, but not really doing anything other than occasionally help out Morty, and give himself a couple boons like interdimensional TV. Then again, he most certainly doesn't care about the whole "humanity" thing or any material wealth he'd get from helping them; it's hard to get him to care about <em>anything</em> in the first place.
</li><li> The Crystal Gems of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em> have incredible technology, including teleportation and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardLight">Hard Light</a> projections that appear to violate conservation of energy, but humans seem completely unaware they even have it.

However, it is shown they don't think much on humans (mainly Pearl) and it's not like the Beach City folk express any interest in the technology.
</li><li> Averted for the most part with Stu Pickles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a></em>. His income actually <em>comes</em> from his selling his inventions. The one time he seems useless is when he builds a fully-functional <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Godzilla">Reptar</a> that can stretch its limbs, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jetpack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jetpack">butt rocket</a>, is surprisingly durable, and can throw a mean punch... and sells it to a stage show in France instead of the military or NASA for millions.

This guy is a genius who's invented a light bulb that can last several thousand years, a mind-control device and so much more, even getting his PhD early despite his setback. However, being born with six fingers on each hand led to him becoming fascinated and later <em>entrenched</em> into the world of the weird and the supernatural. He <strong>does</strong> wish to change the world, but do so on his accord, born from his need of validation coming from his interest in the paranormal. It also stems from a desire to be more independent from Stan as children and that he had to be a "lone hero." This leads him to bearing a grudge against Stan for accidentally breaking his perpetual motion machine in high school and losing his chance at his dream school (something he still harbored for the grudge for). Needless to say, while he is quite brilliant, he's not exactly wise.</span>
<ul><li> Of course, he does admit that he was rather foolish and somewhat naïve back then, and he's gotten a bit wiser now. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Furthermore, he has been missing for 30 years, lost in the various universes.

Ford turned on Bill when he saw his true colors. In the end of the series, he notes this flaw and how Stan would've seen a conman like Bill coming and the two patch things up.</span>
