A lot of people are captured, killed or both, including her twin sister, her sadistic grandmother, and the village headman, who are all part of the village mafia. Then Shion goes after Satoshi's little sister, Satoko, because she's mad that Satoko's dependence on Satoshi wore him out. Shion captures Satoko and tortures her to death. <em>Then she remembers that Satoshi's last request was that she care for Satoko for him.</em> Shion was already crazy, but now she loses any pretense of acting for anything besides her own dark pleasure.</span>
<ul><li> To add to the issue <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it's revealed their deaths were in vain. None of them had to do with Satoshi's disappearance, and if anything they all liked him</span>.

<ul><li> Light Yagami begins using the supernatural notebook to rid society of objectively unforgivable criminals, but soon his blacklist expands to include anyone who stands in his way for any reason, starting with Lind L. Taylor, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a patsy used by L to denounce and threaten Kira</span> and the FBI. Along the way, he coolly manipulates the feelings of both people and shinigami. Repeatedly stating that he plans to become the god of the new world he is trying to create doesn't help matters, either.
</li><li> For that matter, Teru Mikami uses the notebook to eliminate minor and reformed criminals. Eventually, he declares he will start executing people who are just lazy or do not contribute to society. Light has to work to stop him, not because he'd never want the book to be used like that, but because he believes it's too early to be going that far. Meaning that Light could very well be planning on going down that path, once he's rid the world of its more undesirable people.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam00">Mobile Suit Gundam 00</a></em>:
<ul><li> Depending on your viewpoint, Celestial Being itself was doing a lesser version of this before Trinity even showed up. They certainly had no compunctions about blowing up a training facility for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> children, and all the civilians inside, as a revenge operation.
<ul><li> Allelujah certainly had his compunctions.
</li><li> As did the rest of Celestial Being. Halleluah, Allelujah's dark half, enjoyed it and egged him on.
</li></ul></li><li> It must be noted that Celestial Being actively tried to avoid civilian casualties, such as Lockon shooting to disable enemy suits when possible, or Setsuna taking off their limbs but not gutting them or cutting them in half. Celestial Being attacked only areas of active combat and repeatedly tried to prevent situations that would increase civilian casualties, such as stopping a terrorist attack on a nuclear waste dump. Trinity, by contrast, repeatedly attacked civilians targets (including simple factories) and expressed neither remorse, guilt, or sadness for it, and then in a childish fit attacked a WEDDING. That's why the Trinities are portrayed as much farther down the slope.
<ul><li> Yet it must be pointed out that Gundam 00 was heavy on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> aspect and the side documents explained that the Trinities resorting to extreme measures and having sociopathic natures were not of their own intentions, but rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">as a result of their development</a>. (Nena, the one who attacked said wedding, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientComa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientComa">was kept in stasis from her birth to her tenth birthday</a> and thus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychopathicManchild">has always the mentality of a little girl</a>) Because their role was to make Celestial Being look bad, and then die immediately afterwards, their resorting to harsh measures was simply to cause a public relations nightmare with the group, and to ensure that Celestial Being would not bother helping the Trinity siblings in their hour of need (Setsuna did not intentionally save Nena, but rather was attempting to stop Ali al-Saachez from using a Gundam, especially since they used the Trinities' fight for survival as battle strategy for opponents).
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AirGear">Air Gear</a></em> jumped long before the series began.

</li><li> The last two episodes of the first generation in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamAGE">Mobile Suit Gundam AGE</a></em> shows Flit Asuno taking the dark descent to becoming a revenge-obsessed Earth Federation fanatic. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His refusal to accept the UE as human beings and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a> from seeing Yurin die only matters worse for him.</span> As an adult, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">leads a task force that purges the Federation government of any and all Vagan sympathizers, accusing them of collaboration and having them executed. When it's pointed out that this action will kill any chance of a peaceful resolution to the conflict, Flit merely says "Yes, I know. That was my intention from the beginning"</span>.

<ul><li> Zeheart Galette has crossed it in the third generation by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">putting his full faith in Ezelcant's true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Social Darwinist</a> agenda, despite the fact that it involves killing Vagan citizens and Ezelcant himself admitting that he was insane.

Before this, he was a committed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiVillain">Anti-Villain</a> who made a point of remembering that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeadHaveNames">The Dead Have Names</a>, still acknowledged that Asemu had been a friend, and said that he was fighting to return his people to the "Eden" of the Earth Sphere.

Baby can hatch his eggs in other lifeforms, transforming them into his obedient puppets that consider themselves Tuffles. Initially, his goal is to make an entire universe of Tuffles by infecting every single sapient being (except for Saiyans, whom he wants to slaughter). So far, not exactly righteous, but at least somewhat understandable: he's been wronged and he's only trying to "restore" his species and punish their enemies. But as Baby grows more powerful, he starts becoming more and more cruel and selfish, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay">his motivations gradually degrade into more simplistic ones</a>: "<em>rule the world</em>", "<em>be the strongest in the universe</em>", "<em>kill Son Goku</em>".

</li><li> In the miniseries <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherBorn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisherBorn">Born</a></em> it's pretty much stated the Punisher is a sociopath who's addicted to killing, and that if it wasn't criminals it would just be someone else.

When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/EmmaFrost">Emma Frost</a> discovers that he's subconsciously put a block in his mind that prevents him from retaining the knowledge permanently, David asks Emma to remove the block, figuring he'll be able to do so much good for the world that way.

Okay, that's certainly bad, but we're still at the point where it can be argued to be worth it.

Or just allowed her to manifest naturally), <em>denies</em> her anasthesia when he surgically removes her claws several days later to coat them in adamantium, uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a> to condition her to the trigger scent, puts her in the "care" of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> psychopath, treats her as an animal and subjects her to years of physical and emotional abuse, tries to kill her at one point by abandoning her on a mission, and oh yeah, sends her <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> to kill the man who practically raised him from a toddler, and the man's wife and son (who is actually <em>his</em> son from an affair with the woman)</span>. Rice doesn't so much as jumping off the slippery slope as taking to it in a rocket sled. And then keep on going.
<ul><li> Laura herself at times teeters at the brink of it. Her willingness to kill and otherwise get her hands dirty puts her at odds with her teammates (when she teamed up with Hellion to rescue Cessily from the Facility he was greatly disturbed by how far she was willing to go as part of the mission, including outright torture and murder of the people they interrogated), and she's constantly struggling with her training; <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AvengersArena">Avengers Arena</a></em> reveals she automatically formulates multiple plans to kill <em>everyone in a room with her</em> the moment she steps inside. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Even her friends and loved ones</a>, and she <em>can't shut it off</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronWoobie">It's astonishing that for all the pain, suffering and heartbreak she's endured she manages to keep holding on to her humanity.</a>

However, after the Scarecrow doused him with Fear Gas and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">the System</a> kicked in, Jean-Paul's morality started to waver. He came close to viciously murdering villains such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheJoker">The Joker</a>, Tally Man, and Mr. Freeze, and nearly killed Tim when he tried to get Az!Bats to tone down the violence. After letting Abbatoir die by falling into a vat of molten steel, which ensured his captive's death, he decided to embrace his more vicious and brutal side once and for all, leading Bruce to come back and take the mantle from him by force. It's implied <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">by some stories</a> that Bruce's fear of going down that same path is why he adheres so rigidly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">never killing villains</a>, no matter how evil they are and no matter how likely they are to escape and kill again.

Anakin finally slips so far, his own wife, Padme Amidala, loses the will to live and eventually dies, and Obi-Wan Kenobi is forced to duel him, ending gruesomely. In order to keep Anakin alive, Emperor Palpatine, a.k.a. Darth Sidious subjects him to painful body reconstruction. The final push to the Dark Side comes from Palpatine himself- when Anakin asks if Padme is still alive, the Emperor tells him in his anger, he killed her. In pure disbelief of this, Anakin's true power flares up, and he screams out in despair, fully overtaken with pain and hate, completing his transformation into Darth Vader. What was especially loathsome of him was that, rather than desiring everyone's well-being, his honest desire for good was corrupted into infatuation and affection (he wanted to be together with her, alive, rather than desiring what's best for everyone); a desire to be with her for the sake of his pride; to feel good about himself for being able to keep the people he knows personally from dying (although, sadly for him, Palpatine never had any concern for his wife, to begin with).

Any question of who had the moral high ground went out the window when Jiaying, the Inhumans' leader who had been corrupted by a brutal vivisection at the hands of Dr Whitehall, a member of HYDRA, murdered a S.H.I.E.L.D. representative in cold blood at a peace meeting and framed it to look like S.H.I.E.L.D. was attacking them, then set up a trap to draw as many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as she could to an aircraft carrier she had hijacked and planned to flood with synthesized Terrigen Mist, which would kill any non-Inhumans who were exposed to it. Her power, previously assumed to be longevity through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, was suddenly revealed to require her to literally drain the life out of other people to sustain herself (granted, she originally hated this power until her vivisection), which she attempts on <em>her own daughter</em> (who also happens to be an Inhuman) after she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallingTheOldManOut">calls her out</a> on the above plan and tries to stop her.

In fact, the episode "Pegasus" had had to be radically trimmed to fit network time constraints; some of the footage that was lost (and reinstated on the DVD) implied the passing of more time than seems to go by in the episode as aired. The <em>Razor</em> movie, which came later, also expanded on her backstory; she was already a little unbalanced even before the fall of the Twelve Colonies, at which point something... <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">broke</a></em>, thus retconning the events of "Pegasus" into more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>.

</li><li> Warren originally created a robot that would obey his every whim, but he eventually abandoned the android because he wanted a girlfriend that would be a partner in the relationship and he fell in love with a woman with her own ideas and personality.

While they trick the humans into it, all they really want is anti-radiation drugs which would allow them to leave their suits. It then turns out that their bodies have adapted to need radiation and the withdrawal sends them mad before killing them, so they decide to shoot out a load of radioactive waste onto the planet again when they realise they can't survive without radiation.

They want to take over all of Earth's <em>living</em> bodies  but even before we learn this, we can tell that they're malevolent, because shortly after getting the Doctor's go-ahead, they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodColorsEvilColors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodColorsEvilColors">switch from pale blue to bright red and Satanic</a>.

While this comes off as slightly sinister, it's hard to see how they could ever be an enemy- until, of course, the "breeders" of the Adipose decide that their current method is too slow and try to make Adipose out of the entire body of their victims, killing them in the process. Jumping? More like a great, flying leap.

The Doctor officially jumps in two stories in which he is without a companion, though he does manage to return to the side of right in both:
<ul><li> The Tenth Doctor does this in the last 10 or so minutes of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars">"The Waters of Mars"</a>. After having spent the whole episode with a group of people destined to die, the Doctor snaps and decides to save them after most of them have already been killed. Just moments after saving the remaining people (in the most epic way possible), the Doctor decides that he can mess with the timeline in any way he sees fit, completely ignoring his species' laws. At this point, the Doctor is almost antagonistic. Thankfully the Doctor is only in this state for one scene and is brought down a couple of pegs before he can really do anything.
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor does this in the Series 9 finale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent">"Hell Bent"</a>. All season he'd been struggling with how much he could or couldn't do to save those around him  letting O'Donnell die and being willing to die himself but still trying to save his beloved companion Clara Oswald from a preordained death in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E4BeforeTheFlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E4BeforeTheFlood">"Before the Flood"</a>, and immortalizing Ashildr/Me in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E5TheGirlWhoDied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E5TheGirlWhoDied">"The Girl Who Died"</a> because it was the only way he could save her from the grave. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E10FaceTheRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E10FaceTheRaven">"Face the Raven"</a>, he considered going on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a> that would have slaughtered innocents over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clara's <em>actual</em> death</span> but Clara talked him down.

So in "Hell Bent", which takes place after he escapes, he is effectively insane and once again tries to alter a fixed point in time by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">undoing Clara's death altogether</span>, which took place <em>billions</em> of years ago in-universe by the time he manages to get the means to do so; he has no plan to avert the destruction of the universe this would cause and basically hopes he'll get lucky, and justifies his actions by invoking his "duty of care" and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeWheresMyReward">Dude, Where's My Reward?</a> For bonus points, he also intends to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> Clara of her memories of him</span>. But <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Clara herself</span> manages to talk him down, and he returns to his best self by not only giving up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicDream">Tragic Dream</a> but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">losing his memories of her</span>, which means he no longer is consumed by the horrors that drove him to extremes.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the final season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary">Elementary</a></em>, Odin Reichenbach is initially presented as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> — he kills people, but only "bad people" and he sincerely believes he's saving innocent lives by doing so. Then, when Sherlock tries to show him another way, by rehabilitating one of the potential killers he's identified, he murders innocent people and frames the guy rather than admit he's wrong.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fringe">Fringe</a></em>: Walternate originally just wanted to save his universe, even if it meant destroying a parallel universe and its inhabitants. Then he attempted to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> kill his son and the mother of his grandchild</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Theon condones the murder of two innocent boys to make it appear as though he has executed the Stark boys Bran and Rickon.
</li><li> Tyrion has clearly snapped by the end of his trial, but his murders of Tywin and Shae cement how far he's gone from the noble anti-hero he once was. Oddly he sort of climbs back up the slope in later seasons, trying to protect his brother and sister from Daenerys's wrath (unlike his book counterpart who is openly in favor of killing everyone in King's Landing and even demands to Daenerys that he be allowed to rape his sister Cersei).
</li><li> The most extreme case is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Daenerys just flat-out snapping in the final season and burning most of King's Landing to the ground, soldiers and civilians and even <em>children</em> alike, an act that flies completely in the face of all the principles she ever held or espoused</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> There are few series with more examples than <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Gotham">Gotham</a></em>.
<ul><li> The prime example that the whole series explores in his descent to murder and monstrosity is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Edward Nygma. He was in love with Kringle and demanded her abusive boyfriend's face to leave her alone. He responded by assaulting him, and in the ensuing conflict he ended up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManslaughterProvocation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManslaughterProvocation">stabbing him to death in an extreme move of self-defense</a>. Things went really downhill when Kringle found out and during a psychotic outburst of panic he strangled her to death without even realizing it. When he saw what he did, he lost any resemblance of a conscience and murdered a possible witness and then he did two atrocities in one strike by murdering an innocent cop in order to frame Jim for the latter's murder</span>.
</li><li> The Balloonman is one of the only examples who can make anyone question what is right and what is wrong and where do his actions belong. The whole point of his character was that he was tired of seeing big criminals getting away with ruining lives because they were part of the system and started targeting corrupt officials. Even Jim looks uncertain and confused about the moral questions that arise during their showdown. Too bad he chose to close the debate he was winning by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> saying forget it and trying to shoot Jim despite knowing that Jim was a good cop.</span>
</li><li> Even the much darker Jerome Valeska whose later acts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">would need a page of their own</a>, says that his mother (and his first kill) horribly abused and mistreated him and evidence shows that he is likely telling for once the truth.
</li><li> By season 3 we get once more an almost textbook example with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> infected Captain Barnes who starts with killing serial murderers who get pardoned despite the overwhelming evidence to what they did (once again) and ends up being a walking, talking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">Black and White Insanity</a> trope by himself once he tells Gordon that if he isn't with him, he is guilty too and tries to shoot him. And all this while rightfully pointing out that James did the same thing to Theo. Its an almost example, because he was infected and wasn't just being himself</span>. It seems by now that Jim is one of the only who didn't go all the way over the edge.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hannibal">Hannibal</a></em>: Will goes from doing some morally ambiguous, but still understandable things, (such as trying to have Hannibal killed) to something unambiguously evil in "Naka-Choko".

What could have been a two-sided conflict between a racist business owner - albeit one who had a legitimate axe to grind - and a teenager conditioned by poverty and racism to view white people as the enemy shifts step by step into a case of the boy being a clear-cut victim of The Man. First it turns out the business owner framed the kid for stealing the truck as a pretext to have the Challengers Club shut down. Then he escalates to murdering the club owner. Then it turns out he prints white supremacist propaganda and thinks "niggers should be drowned at birth".
</li><li> Lincoln Potter was the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroAntagonist">Hero Antagonist</a> of Season 4 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SonsOfAnarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a></em>, depicted as a largely well-intentioned but morally ambiguous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingLawyer">Crusading Lawyer</a>, with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulative</a> streak that occasionally shone through.

However, between seasons two and three, she transformed into a smirking villain.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk">Monk</a></em>, when Captain's Stottlemeyer's wife is gravely injured in the fallout of a union assassination, Stottlemeyer proceeds to teeter dangerously close to the edge in his hunt for the sniper. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Near the end, he very nearly launches a raid on the suspected union until Monk manages to crack the case.</span>
</li><li> Season two of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderOne">Murder One</a></em> featured a storyline about Clifford Banks, a serial killer who tracked down and executed criminals who escaped justice, or had an unsuitably short prison sentence. He started out on this path through the murder of his retarded brother, he never kills innocent people, and throughout the arc, a few people comment that "sometimes the streets need sweeping." Any moral ambiguity is then done away with by the lawyers finding out that Clifford actually killed his brother himself over his frustration about giving up his whole life to care for him, causing a mental breakdown that directed his guilt outwards onto other criminals.

This ultimately culminates in the season finale, where he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">jumps right into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist">Villain Protagonist</a> territory when he absorbs all the souls of Purgatory and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI">declares himself the new God</a></span>.

The Season 10 finale has him summon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">Death the Horsemen</a> in an attempt to have the Mark removed permanently, only for Death to refuse, because removing the Mark without passing it on to someone else will <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> unleash <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimordialChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrimordialChaos">the Darkness</a>, an entity that was locked inside the Mark of Cain since before creation, and is the reason the Mark corrupts anyone who bears it, thus making it the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the series, by proxy of being the original source of evil in <em>Supernatural</em></span>.

Commit some act that a person at your level of morality would view as 'bad' makes you roll for Degradation, and if you fail the roll you lose a point, and possibly gain a derangement. While each level down takes greater and greater sins (falling from 1 to 0 requires serious atrocities), as your morality gets lower and lower, you stop caring about the harm you're causing, which can make it easier for you to do worse and worse things.

Even when he allied with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople">naga</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">partially demonic Illidan</a>, it was a move of desperation and managed to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">moral center</a> of the group. In Burning Crusade, he's killed as part of Illidan's army, but then he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">Came Back Wrong</a> to reveal he had betrayed him to the Legion and was trying to summon Kil'jaeden so the Burning Legion can destroy Azeroth, killing his own people when they tried to stop him. It's heavily implied that point either the feel magic reanimating him just threw him completely off the slope, or his corpse was just being used by a demon that took on traits of his personality and memory.
</li><li> Illidan was always a self-serving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, but he had a more gentle side to him and never intended his collateral damage. After nearly being killed by Arthas, though, that gentle side was replaced in Burning Crusade with paranoia, insanity and a desire to crush anyone he deems as a threat, which happens to be <em>everyone not on his side.</em> The jump was severe enough that Blizzard went <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">on record</a> expressing a desire to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterRerailment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterRerailment">bring him back for a proper redemption</a>. He finally returns in <em>Legion</em> once more a morally ambiguous character whose positive sides are seen in the greater light. At one point, it seems a little exaggerated; there's a whole questline mostly dedicated to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnergyBeings">Energy Being</a> explaining everything in Illidan's past in a positive light as possible. However, when it actually encounters Illidan, it's shown that the god-like Energy Being is just being kind of dumb, and he doesn't conform to its expectations. He <em>wants</em> to be an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero">Anti-Hero</a>, not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a> by someone else's rules.

Eventually, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he betrays Lordaeron, dons an evil looking armor, and murders his own father</span>. In his case, though, while he had a decline, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">jumping point</a> was the result of taking up a cursed sword that he was too desperate to realize was a trap that stole the soul of <em>anyone</em> it touched.

The first time he used a psi emitter to summon the Zerg it was a military target and the rebels helped the majority of civilians flee.

<ul><li> The first, and main, example of this in the game is of Captain Samuel Ostergaard, who starts off as a relatively reasonable and calm commander of a small Taurian fleet. When his son killed by the heroes when the player raids an illegal gun-running facility, he is consumed by rage at the player and their allies. Afterwards, his navy is called in to fight the protagonists' faction due to attacks on his home planet <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">(that were actually staged by the main antagonist in order to start a war)</span>, he sends wave after wave of soldiers after the heroes. While he's still somewhat stable at this point he fully loses it soon afterwards. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the truth that his "allies" framed the protagonists for attacking the civilians on his homeworld is revealed</span> and is ordered to cease his attack, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> starts a mutiny and seizes command of the fleet, barricades himself in the control room, and attempts to use the fleet to kill the protagonists, disregarding the order to stand down.</span> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> After the heroes use a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">Chekhov's Gun</a> to thwart his attempted attack by remotely detonating the fleet's fuel reserves, he dies when his ship collides with the planet he was going to attack - all to "avenge" the loss of his son.</span>
</li><li> The other example is played rather sympathetically. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Victoria Espinosa starts off as a loving cousin of the player's friend, Queen Kamea Arano. When her father seizes power from on Kamea's coronation day, she ends up becoming Kamea's fiercest enemy.

She uses some questionable means to persuade cities to side with her, but given the incompetence of the heir to the Earth Kingdom's throne, people didn't fault her for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">refusing to relinquish her power to him</span> as had been previously agreed, because she seemed much more capable of actually leading. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Attacking the United Republic</span> might have been going a little far, but a lot of fans could still sympathize with her point of view, given that it used to be Earth Kingdom territory. Then, when her fiance is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">captured and she is offered a deal that will basically allow her to take Bataar Jr. and go home as the uncontested ruler of the Earth Empire if she only agrees to leave the United Republic alone, she decides it would be a better idea to launch an attack with the spirit cannon that will kill her fiance because she believes it will kill Korra as well</span>. The show makes a point out of the fact that Bataar Jr. is not okay with sacrificing his life for the cause.
