</div></div><p>The Ignored Epiphany is a moment where the villain or morally gray character has a moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">clarity or revelation about themselves and their actions</a>, seeing it in perspective for perhaps the first time and realizing exactly how useless and off base their various self-delusions and justifications were. It's often a low moment for these characters, and may provoke sympathy from the audience. The character may acknowledge it various ways, with a sigh, a bitter laugh, muttering "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatHaveIBecome">What Have I Become?</a>" or possibly saying to someone or themselves "I've really messed this one up".

No <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a>, no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath">last minute redemption</a> or even an <em>attempt</em> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustMakeAmends">undo the harm they've wrought</a>. Nor is there any mental trauma equivalent to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBSOD">Villainous BSoD</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">mental breakdown</a>. There's just... nothing.
</p><p>There's generally little, if any change in the character. The moment itself is fleeting, and whether it be their natural temperament reasserting itself, or their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> preventing them from changing, outside events do something that force them out of this frame of mind and right back into their usual one, or simply the feeling that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveComeTooFar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveComeTooFar">they've spent this long and put this much effort into whatever it is they're doing, and now they have to go through with it</a>. A common variant is a character starting to so say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">My God, What Have I Done?</a>'', stopping halfway through, then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">blaming the whole thing on some other person or outside force</a>.

You have no hope of redemption, so there's no point worrying about it any more  may as well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil">embrace the Dark Side</a>, and hope that being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide">Drunk on the Dark Side</a> will <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSideWillMakeYouForget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSideWillMakeYouForget">help you forget your troubles</a>.
</p><p>This is a common issue in works based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a>. Authors and audiences want to see deep moral conflicts in the characters, and see them doubting or guilty over the things we feel they should be doubting or guilty over. The problem is that the real characters may not have felt that at all  so we get fictionalized versions that show great doubts and agonizing self-evaluation in private, then instantly go back to behaving like it never happened when the story continues to follow reality.

</p><p>Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelRealization">Heel Realization</a> which is when a character has an epiphany and realizes for the first time that they're one of the bad guys. Also compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AesopAmnesia">Aesop Amnesia</a> where a character appears to have learned their lesson, but goes back to their old ways in later episodes to maintain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">status quo</a>. Then again, they might be on to something if the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam">HeelFace Door-Slam</a> is any indication. This may happen before pulling a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionRejection">Redemption Rejection</a> when offered that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondChance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastSecondChance">Last-Second Chance</a>.

</p><p>Do note that if this trope hits in, it doesn't mean that they won't ever think of redemption again or being redeemed. The character may find a new epiphany that doesn't get ignored and bring themselves to the good guys again... so long as they don't start <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope">Jumping Off the Slippery Slope</a> or cross the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> beforehand. Or get stuck in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceRevolvingDoor">HeelFace Revolving Door</a>, where the character's epiphany will change him for a while, but he won't permanently follow the path of virtue.

But since he's already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveComeTooFar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IveComeTooFar">come too far</a>, there's no choice left to him but to charge ahead and throw proverbial gasoline on the fire.

The closest he has come is blaming Marinette and Alya for the guilt he feels over overhearing a private conversation — by his logic, if Marinette just <em>told him</em> what he learned that way, he wouldn't have to feel bad about accidentally eavesdropping. Considering that his actions and <em>inaction</em> have led to consequences like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Miracle Queen swiping his ring and Hawkmoth setting Feline Fatale loose on Paris</span>, the fact that said eavesdropping is the only thing he feels mildly guilty about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkewedPriorities">says a lot about his priorities</a>.

</li><li> Bakugou serves as a much straighter example. Not only does he show absolutely no remorse for how he treated Midoriya, he doubles down on his cruelty, insisting that Izuku <em>deserves</em> to be broken.

<div class="indent">I once had a patient, a sound atheist, who used to read in the British Museum. One day, as he sat reading, I saw a train of thought in his mind beginning to go the wrong way. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">The Enemy</a>, of course, was at his elbow in a moment. Before I knew where I was I saw my twenty years' work beginning to totter. If I had lost my head and begun to attempt a defense by argument, I should have been undone. But I was not such a fool. I struck instantly at the part of the man which I had best under my control, and suggested that it was just about time he had some lunch. The Enemy presumably made the countersuggestion (you know how one can never quite overhear what He says to them?) that this was more important than lunch. At least I think that must have been His line, for when I said, "Quite. In fact much TOO important to tackle at the end of a morning," the patient brightened up considerably; and by the time I had added, "Much better come back after lunch and go into it with a fresh mind," he was already halfway to the door. Once he was in the street the battle was won. I showed him a newsboy shouting the midday paper, and a No. 73 bus going past, and before he reached the bottom of the steps I had got into him an unalterable conviction that, whatever odd ideas might come into a man's head when he was shut up alone with his books, a healthy dose of "real life" (by which he meant the bus and the newsboy) was enough to show him that all "that sort of thing" just couldn't be true. He knew he'd had a narrow escape, and in later years was fond of talking about "that inarticulate sense for actuality which is our ultimate safeguard against the aberrations of mere logic." He is now safe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneAfterlife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneAfterlife">Our Father's house</a>.

In the chapter "The Snowmobile," Jack experiences a moment of clarity in which he becomes aware of exactly how the hotel has been manipulating him and turning him against his family. However, he <em>keeps on</em> thinking about the issue so intensely that he changes his own mind, concludes that everything is his five-year-old son's fault and that Jack himself is doomed whatever he does, and destroys the snowmobile, the family's one real chance to escape. It's worth pointing out that it's not just a case of him changing his own mind; as a result of its (very tangible, very unpleasant) influence, his thoughts take a different direction as long as he's not actually inside any of the buildings that make up the hotel.

He started out as a relatively decent guy and family man. Then Arden Gillespie entered into the picture. He became addicted to her, and engaged in adultery.

He made no attempt to make it right. He lost sleep over it, forced Arden to set up some pictures of Sara in their offices (as a reminder of how low they sunk), and tried to spend more time with his family.

He actually wants to find Sara to apologize to her... and use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuyThemOff" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuyThemOff">Buy Them Off</a> on her. He still uses his ill-gotten gain to live the high life. He still cheats on his wife with Arden. Sure, his internal monologues claim that he has no willpower, but it seems that he just uses that to excuse his behaviour. His wife finds out that he cheated on her, throws him out and makes moves to divorce him. He actually tried to claim that he did all this for his wife and brags that he'll bring in lots of money and they'll all live the high life, but she rejects this, and points out that she never wanted to live any high life. She makes it clear that she knows that he and Arden framed Sara and urges him to do the right thing. He just blows that off. Later, he says to Arden, "I just realized something. You don't have a conscience, do you?" Arden simply retorts that it is too late to worry about something like a conscience. Roland is clearly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorribleJudgeOfCharacter">Horrible Judge of Character</a> if he only made this realization at this late date. He makes no attempt to do the right thing or break away from her. He gets involved in another money-stealing scheme with Arden. Sure, he tried to refuse, but he still went and got involved. By the end, he gives off the attitude of a man who wants to get caught and punished. The fact that he has multiple instances just makes him very unsympathetic.

Subverted in "Change Your Mind", in which both of them <em>finally</em> realize they've been repeating the exact same cycle that drove Pink away in the first place</span>.

<ul><li> This trope, along with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">Never My Fault</a>, is one of the many traits of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">sociopath</a>, since it is nearly impossible for them to feel guilt; even if they do, they tend to sweep it under the rug.
</li><li> Also a defining trait of fanatical people (whether religious, political, or otherwise). Whenever they discover evidence that their ideology might be wrong, they will make any excuse, no matter how strained or ridiculous it sounds, rather than change their minds.
</li><li> Early in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, during the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Nazis carried out conventional acts of genocide via having death squads (<em>Einsatzgruppen</em>) massacre whole villages of Jews and similar undesirables. Problems started cropping up when the soldiers participating in the massacres started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">collapsing in horror</a> at repeated murder, and even Heinrich Himmler vomited at the site of one such atrocity. Instead of acceding to these feelings of horror, however, the Nazis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticallyMissingThePoint">simply decided they needed a more detached and mechanical means of mass murder</a>, and thus the original <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalSolution">Final Solution</a> was born.
