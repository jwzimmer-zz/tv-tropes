Lawful Neutral characters believe in order — personal, systemic, peace, three of them or either — above all else. They will always seek to obey and preserve order, even to the inconvenience of themselves and others, and even if they themselves admit the law in question is an annoying one. While a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> character may justify breaking his code of conduct by appealing to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForGreatJustice">greater good</a> that transcends all things, a Lawful Neutral character will not, since the greater good does not enter into it.
</p><p>An important thing to note is that <strong>Lawful Neutral characters follow their own personal vision of order and law</strong>. This order may be defined by the laws of their current location, or it might not: Lawful Neutral characters will not obey every law they ever encounter, only those that are part of or do not conflict with the code they themselves obey. They may perfectly rebel against authority if they disagree with this authority's laws, and still be Lawful.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Lawful Neutral comes in a number of different forms:
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>Authority First and Foremost:</strong> Someone with this mindset believes that the context matters more than the content; the rules matter because they give order to society more than they matter themselves. They might go so far as to believe (possibly correctly) that their superiors have the right to interpret or define the rules as they see fit. Such characters believe in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyCountryRightOrWrong">My Country</a> / <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">My Master, Right or Wrong</a>, though the average example is someone who obeys any figure of authority (say, a policeman) without question, possibly even with admiration. In more extreme cases, this can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">Just Following Orders</a>, and whether or not they slip into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> territory is a question of whether said authority is evil and is getting them to commit atrocities — however, they still have moral lines they won't cross, and if their ethics are pushed too far, they will disobey, and are not above holding their superiors to account if they are found to be corrupt or incompetent. This is what separates them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a>.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><li> <strong>Equality Under the Law:</strong> The Law applies to everybody, friend or foe, superior or subordinate. At worst they run the risk of being bigots towards other cultures and codes of law. Essentially, they do not justify the Law with arguments about there not being anything better, but those that argue that these Laws <em>are</em> the better, and may resist even legal attempts to change them. They are also the most likely to hold their superiors to account for failing to follow the rules, whether for heroic reasons or villainous ones. May or not may be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a>.
</li><li> <strong>Internal Moral Compass:</strong> This character follows a personal code, including those that have been organised by another — for example, a warrior code or a religious creed — or one they have constructed for themselves. They will obey this code rigidly and to the letter, and it will usually supersede (but make allowances for) any of the other types, but it (or their devotion to it) is too rigid for them to be considered Chaotic, even if it puts them at odds with the established system of law and order, while they lack the moral or immoral conviction to be considered Good or Evil. At their best, they will obey the spirit as well as the letter of their codes, or at least try to or recognise that they must, but at their worst, they can become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">Principles Zealot</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TautologicalTemplar">Tautological Templar</a> who puts their own code — and their own <em>interpretation</em> of said code — above all else.
</li><li> <strong>The Lawmaker:</strong> This character arises in a vacuum — they find themselves in a situation where neither Authority nor the Rules apply, such as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">After the End</a> scenario where law and order have broken down, and seek to establish order (or follow another who does). Typically, they will appeal to a pre-established system as the basis — murder is wrong because it <em>used</em> to be wrong, or because civilised societies are expected to have outlawed such acts. It can also occur where there <em>is</em> a sense of order, just not one that the character recognises as valid, such as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> where the "order" comes from corruption and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>, or more dubiously, a working society they deem to be chaotic or inferior. In <em>these</em> cases, they will probably appeal to their own rules or the rules of their own society or culture. At their best, they will bring a sense of structure and justice to a volatile situation, but at their worst, this type can slide into bigotry and tyranny, worsened by the fact that they are basically making the rules from scratch.
</li></ul><p>Any of these types can fall into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> if they are not careful, and not thinking critically enough. However, none of them automatically equate to it, and each has as good a chance of being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Reasonable Authority Figure</a> or equivalent as the next.
</p><p>A Lawful Neutral alignment is easy to play because it involves adherence to defined codes first and foremost — all personal moral issues come second. On the other hand, it can become rather restrictive and predictable. Those adhering to personal codes rather than <em>the</em> law may find it tough to uphold, as the only one to make sure they keep to their code is them. Furthermore, inexperienced roleplayers who play as Lawful Neutral 'cop' types may find themselves slipping into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a> territory.
</p><p>The key here is the desire to preserve or create order, at any personal cost. The character will be unquestioningly devoted to the written code, either because they don't have the intelligence to apply critical thinking to it, or because while they are intelligent and capable of independent thought when needs be, preservation of the society is the ultimate goal, and it is believed that the Law and the society itself are inescapably the same thing. If the Law is compromised, the society will go with it. Altruism and egoism are generally regarded as irrelevant, with each being considered as potentially dangerous as the other.
</p><p>In theory, many loyal servants of the Empire, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> in general, should tend towards this alignment because they believe in authority and law over considerations of good or evil. However, in practice, this is the type of Lawful Neutral character that is by far the most likely to end up doing evil deeds by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustFollowingOrders">following orders</a>, slipping into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> alignment.
</p><p>We must reiterate: <strong>Lawful Neutral does not necessarily mean <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a></strong>. Lawful Neutral will not necessarily obsess over every law, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllCrimesAreEqual">consider all crimes as equal</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">refuse to compromise his moral code at all costs</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">and nastier extremism</a>. Yes, there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrinciplesZealot">Principles Zealot</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> Lawful Neutrals, but it doesn't mean Lawful Neutral IS this.

</p><hr/><p>If you have difficulty deciding which alignment your neutral-aligned character belongs to, the main difference between Lawful Neutral, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> is not their lack of devotion to either good or evil, but the methods they believe are best to show it:
</p><p></p><ul><li> Lawful Neutral characters believe the best way is to have a specific, strict code of conduct, whether self-imposed or codified as a law. Their first impulse when making a moral decision is to refer back to this code; those with externally imposed systems (codes of laws, hierarchies, etc.) will try to work within the system when those systems go wrong. They will refuse to break this code even if good could be done by breaking it.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> (Unaligned) characters are indifferent to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order Versus Chaos</a>, and their only interest is in living their own lives. They simply live their lives, whether that means tearing down a code of laws, following a code of laws, creating an orderly society, causing the breakdown of some kinds of order, or staying away from society altogether. They have no particular objective.
<ul><li> Some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> characters are instead considering both sides (plus <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteMorality">Black-and-White Morality</a>) as extremes and thrive for a balance between each of those sides.
</li></ul></li><li> Most <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> characters don't constantly break the law, but they cannot see much value in laws. They believe that their own consciences are their best guides, and that tying themselves to any given code of conduct would be limiting their own ability to do what they want. They do not get along with anyone who tries to instill any kind of order over them, believing these people to be restricting their freedom. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a> characters often focus very strongly on their individual rights and freedoms, and will strongly resist any form of oppression of themselves.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AloofBigBrother">Byakuya Kuchiki</a> is willing to let his sister be executed because it was a lawful decision by Soul Society's ruling body and he personally believed that if nobles like him don't uphold the law, no one will. Though he shifts a little towards Lawful Good later on.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGood">Genryusai Yamamoto</a> almost personifies this alignment: "No personal justice takes precedence over the world's justice".
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Sui-Feng</a> has some tendencies toward this alignment, but has an almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> stance when dealing with lawbreakers, and despite knowing what Yoruichi did, is primarily upset over her not taking her with her when she left Soul Society.

<ul><li> L. His pursuit of Kira is more about "winning" than stopping him because it's the right thing to do. At the same time, he also goes to extreme lengths to secure solid evidence that Light is Kira, despite everything that his intuition is (correctly) telling him; he doesn't go outside the law and stays firmly on the line.
</li><li> Near. Despite the fact that his situation is made personal by the death of his mentor, he appears to be a lot more neutrally inclined than L. He does tell a few lies and manipulates circumstances to get his own way, though seems a lot more neutral and collected in his approach to situations. He also seems to be very mature in terms of ideals with a pragmatic, existentialist point of view on justice.
</li><li> NPA Director Kitamura has the police stop investigating the Yotsuba Kira on orders from the government after the Yotsuba Kira starts influencing politicians. He disagrees with the order, but follows it, noting that "if the government is destroyed, so is the country", being less concerned about letting a mass murderer go free.
</li><li> Light Yagami himself might be this at best before he receives his Death Note, given that he hates all criminals in the world who may or may not be villains in nature.
</li><li> Uniquely among the Shinigami, Rem probably falls under this alignment. She doesn't care about good or evil as such, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl">her only loyalty is to Misa</a>, who is one of the villains. She also expresses personal disgust for most of the humans fighting over the Death Note and despises their petty and callous murders for the sake of power.

For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Bureau founders</span> have become so obsessed with keeping the peace that the Combat Mages under them are little more than convenient tools to be used and discarded as necessary for this goal.
<ul><li> General Regius goes from being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> and wanting to change the system to being Lawful Neutral and helping back several of the more ethically dubious actions of the TSAB, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">like the Combat Cyborg program</span>. He despises Section 6 for being run by the "criminal" Hayate Yagami, in addition to his preference for the ground forces, and tries to get it shut down.
</li><li> The Wolkenritter start out as this, presumably obeying their masters' orders in order to increase their power. In contrast to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> Signum and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a> Shamal and Vita, Zafira retains this alignment after coming into Hayate's service, stating that as a guardian beast, he does what is best for his master regardless of whether it is right or wrong.

<ul><li> Maria Graceburt has some Lawful Neutral tendencies, as she believes that Otome must obey their masters even if doing so results in them fighting against their friends, but later on, questions some of those beliefs as a result of what Arika said on that matter.

His beliefs also cause him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">to be forced to save himself and the thousands he evacuated on time, but leave everyone else to die</span>.
</li><li> Ogami Itto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoneWolfAndCub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoneWolfAndCub">Lone Wolf and Cub</a></em>. Not a nice guy (he was perfectly willing to kill his 1-year-old son if the baby hadn't "chosen" to come along on his mission of revenge), but not really evil either, just devoted to an ultra-inflexible code of honor.
</li></ul><ul><li> Saitou Hajime in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a></em>. Once a Bakufu loyalist in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheShinsengumi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheShinsengumi">The Shinsengumi</a>, after the Meiji victory in the Meiji Revolution, he goes to work for the Meiji government as an agent and policeman so long as he can dispense his strict code of justice: Slay Evil Immediately.

Saitou coldly informs the kid that revenge killings are illegal, so if the kid does it, Saitou will arrest him too. Saitou then "reassures" the kid by telling him that Senkaku will probably be executed and tortured for information first, which would be much worse for him than dying painlessly. Major case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodIsNotNice">Good Is Not Nice</a>, and that's without mentioning his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">Jerkass</a> tendencies towards supporting characters.

She might seem <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> because she cares about The Band of Hawk, but she will follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> Griffith's orders without question and even kill her own comrades if they disobey them. Even after she falls in love with Guts, she still chooses to be loyal to Griffith. That is until the Eclipse; she has likely become Unaligned or True Neutral due to her impaired mental state.
</li><li> Detective Lunge of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em> has almost no concern either way for the well being of others, willingly and remorselessly driving away even his own family if it brings him a step closer to catching a criminal.

Their job as police officers is to uphold the law for the betterment of society. This means busting criminals by normal means, but also going to lengths such as torturing criminals, hacking the information right out of their brain, using viruses or political influence to prevent the media from obtaining information on an event happening, causing "accidents" to corrupt politicians, district attorneys, and corporate executives, or even uprooting the government's own ruling administration. Nobody is exempt, but they fight to maintain peace for the betterment of Japan. They aren't breaking the law themselves though, due to loopholes that allow them to exist outside of public knowledge.

Of course, as it turns out, the councilman is more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> than anything else, and the entire bit is just a plot cooked up by Koizumi to appease Haruhi with a temporary antagonist, whom she certainly <em>believes</em> is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">Inspector Javert</a>.

</li><li> Satsuki Kiryuin...okay, this one gets complicated. She normally acts as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> villain, running Honnouji Academy under a tyrannical regime and ruthlessly executing those who can't keep up. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> However, it turns out that she's got very good reasons for her actions; namely, to rebel against her wicked family and save the world from being eaten by their Life Fiber-infused clothing.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a>. His vision of an orderly society involves shooting every single mobster, terrorist, serial killer, and miscellaneous scumbag he can find. Good characters who interfere with his plans are treated better than his usual targets, but are still subject to nasty injuries if he deems it necessary. However, he'll never intentionally kill them or any civilians.
</li><li> Ultimate Ronan the Accuser. He's dedicated at performing his duty of punishing the enemies of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a>, and is loyal to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> father, Ultimate Thanos, but has a conscience and feels guilt when he has to kill innocents.
<ul><li> The classic 616 version of Ronan eventually develops into this alignment during the cosmic storyline Annihilation, where he punishes the corrupt House Fiyero not for revenge but because they committed crimes against the Kree empire.
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> Eric Finch from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/VForVendetta">V for Vendetta</a></em>.

Interestingly, his initial portrayal floated somewhere between Authority First and Foremost and Equality Under the Law, before settling firmly into the latter. One story has him (temporarily) stripped of his authority as a Judge, and we see him strolling merrily past all this horrible crime without interfering since vigilante justice is illegal. At another point, a quasi-revolution happens and the people want to elect a REAL leader, rather than just a "liaison between the people and the Judges": despite the vote eventually deciding to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod">keep the Hall of Justice in power</a>, Dredd and company openly state that, if they had been voted out of power, they would have stepped down despite having more than enough firepower and knowhow to keep control through force.
<ul><li> The America/Democracy storylines did wonders for Dredd's self-awareness, and capacity for introspection. While the modern Dredd is still a very heavy supporter of the rules, he at times demonstrates that he has developed his own conscience, as well.

Michael and Duma are the only ones that live up to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> reputation.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/God">Yahweh</a> tends towards this, with the difference being that he is making the rules.

While usually an honest man, and a more sympathetic ear than anyone else on Uncle Sam's payroll, his acting in his agency's best interest makes him as much a sparring partner of regular heroes as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/IncredibleHulk">The Incredible Hulk</a> is. Of course, this is compared with Marvel's very iconoclastic collection of heroes — by government standards, he's a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowboyCop">Cowboy Cop</a> who occasionally goes renegade. (To be honest, you'll find just about anyone with a lawful alignment goes renegade sooner or later.)
</li><li> Moses, the watchdog of McKenzie Farm from <em>Lupo Alberto</em>. He is determined to keep the protagonist out of the farm and to make his inhabitants work with order and discipline. He may also appear as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> when he enjoys giving Alberto a brutal beating. It should be noted he is much more affable when off-duty, and that Alberto is a <em>wolf</em> that candidly admits to eat chicken, even when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackPairing">his girlfriend is a hen herself</a> (and has once tried to eat her best friend).

When a leader, he's hardass and impersonal. He's been known to outright dismiss magic, or have a distaste for it when it shows up. And his superheroic antics often feel like they're more upholding a status quo than improving lives. Hell, after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CivilWar">Civil War</a>, some might peg him as downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulStupid">Lawful Stupid</a>, but we can meet him halfway on this — it certainly showed that for him, goodness came second to law and order. However, most adaptations, following on from the characterisation of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelCinematicUniverse">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> version place him squarely in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> territory.

Note that his civilian identities have all, aside from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GreenLantern">Hal Jordan</a>, been policemen (Well, Hal is a cop, he's just a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceCop">Space cop</a>). His concern is with punishing evil and keeping the world of magic honest.

He even says that he stands for the Law. He wishes to protect the kingdom above all else, and has genuine concern for the populace. Tyrian upholds the Lottery because it has kept the land safe, and even when the King begs Galen to stop the Lottery because <em>this</em> time the sacrifice is his <em>daughter</em>, Tyrian outright disobeys his King to stop Galen, because the Law <em>must</em> be upheld to prevent the dragon from going on <em>another</em> rampage. Had he not been a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, he'd have evoked far more sympathy from the audience.

When Bryan later confronts Jean-Claude with the latter's possible involvement in the kidnapping, Jean-Claude coldly replies, "My salary is 'x'; my expenses are 'y'. So long as my family is provided for, I do not care where the difference comes from. <em>That</em> is my entire involvement."

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars Expanded Universe</a> generally describes Stormtroopers, TIE pilots, and so forth as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">just doing their jobs.</a>
<ul><li> The Clone Troopers practically embody this trope. They go from fighting alongside the Jedi to murdering them the moment Palpatine utters the words, "Execute Order 66." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says Order 66 wasn't subconsciously programmed into them, so they're not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">Brainwashed and Crazy</a>, either. However, the Order 66 arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarWarsTheCloneWars">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></em> contradicts this by revealing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the clones did have chips in their brains so that they could carry out the order</span>. It's also helpful to remember that the Jedi <em>did</em> try to kill Palpatine; if you didn't know the context (and maybe even if you did), it would be easy to interpret them as the bad guys.
</li></ul></li><li> Boba Fett in the Expanded Universe. He has a personal code of honor and justice and he only accepts jobs that follow it.

</div></li><li> One of the soon to be female bank robbers ('Frankie') from the film <em>Set It Off</em> sees Detective Waller as this. Mostly because Waller is a fellow black woman who seems very unsympathetic to her plight of being fired from her job as a bank teller because she got scared and didn't follow proper procedure during a bank robbery. Frankie felt she was being scapegoated because she had a passing association with the robber. Upon her firing, and being grilled by Detective Strode on how to follow procedure, she looks at Waller and sarcastically says <em>Thanks for your help sista.</em>

</li><li> Gerd Wiesler from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivesOfOthers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLivesOfOthers">The Lives of Others</a></em> starts out as this, teaching his students matter of factly about interrogation techniques in East Germany and disregarding one student's protest that sleep deprivation is "inhuman" (even marking him in a way that implies his career will <em>not</em> be moving forward). Ironically, it is his Lawful Neutral nature that eventually pushes him into becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a>, as it becomes obvious that his superior, Lt. Colonel Grubitz, is not as interested in following the law as pleasing his own superiors — hence the (at first) unjustified investigation into playwright Dreymann's life, in order to free up his girlfriend for the lecherous Minister Hempf. By the time <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dreymann really <em>is</em> up to something (albeit something rather harmless), Wiesler is so disgusted by his superiors and so sympathetic to the playwright that he deliberately disobeys orders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousProtector">and protects Dreymann</a>, at the cost of his own career</span>.

The premise of the movie is that he left Neverland, got married, had children, forgot who he used to be, and became a boring lawyer. When he's forced to return to Neverland, his completely opposite attitude from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooland">everyone there</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonderland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWonderland">the whole place itself</a> makes his stay extremely awkward, until, of course, he regains his memories and former personality, depicted as very much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a>.

He believes that the law must be followed even if evil people can take advantage of it, and that if you break the law to fight evil, then the law can also be broken to fight good...

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a></em> is usually this. He has no qualms about abruptly killing somebody if he feels the person in question is jeopardizing the British justice system. While he rarely acts out of pure malice, he also rarely acts out of true moral benevolence, usually preferring to simply keep order and do as the mission tells him to. Sometimes Daniel Craig's rendition falls more under <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticNeutral">Chaotic Neutral</a>, such as in the opening scene of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a></em>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DriveAngry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DriveAngry">Drive Angry</a></em>, both the Accountant and Satan are portrayed as such. The Accountant is a classic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">Inspector Javert</a> who doesn't give a damn what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfinishedBusiness">Unfinished Business</a> Milton has; all that matters is that he drags him back to Hell to face his penance for the sins he committed in life. Meanwhile, Satan is described as a bookish man who simply does his job of being the warden of the universe's biggest prison. That said, there are limits to how much shit they will tolerate; sacrificing children in Satan's name is a good way to piss him off, and the Accountant won't lift a finger to save you from your righteous punishment.

<div class="indent">Inspector Javert's mental attitude was compounded of two very simple principles, admirable in themselves but which, by carrying them to extremes, he made almost evil — respect for authority and hatred of all forms of revolt against it. Theft, murder, and every other crime were to him all forms of revolt. Everybody who played any part in the running of the State, from First Minister to the <em>garde champerte</em> was invested in his eyes with a kind of mystical sanctity, and he felt nothing but contempt, aversion and disgust for those who, only if only once, transgressed beyond the bounds of law. His judgements were absolute, admitting no exceptions. [...] He would have arrested his own father escaping from prison and denounced his mother for breaking parole, and he would have done it with a glow of conscious rectitude.
</div><ul><li> Interestingly, he is no less harsh on himself as he is on others. Once he realises that Jean Valjean is a good man, he realises that his pursuit of him has been unjust. Since that makes <em>him</em> an unjust man and a criminal, the only solution is suicide.

An extreme example. His only interest is in maintaining the status quo and the ancient traditions of the country, and he basically runs the country on behalf of the sovereign, keeping it in a state of stagnation.

<ul><li> Morgan is a unique example: he's clearly established as this in the first book, and every time Harry interacts with him, it's clear that Morgan believes so strongly in the Seven Laws of Magic that he has absolutely zero problem with killing a warlock (a wizard that has gone power-mad after breaking the laws) even if they're a teenager. Harry thinks that Morgan has it out for him specifically for the first several books. It's not until <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadBeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DeadBeat">Dead Beat</a></em> that Harry realizes that Morgan is old, a couple of centuries at least, and has been using his Sight to judge warlocks<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note195ww');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note195ww" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note195ww');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">When wizards see something with the Sight, they'll see it in the same clarity for the rest of their lives. Harry sees something he doesn't like at least once a book and has been active for about a quarter century. Morgan sees something more often than that, and has been active much longer</span>. Harry finally realizes that Morgan isn't a <em>zealot</em>, he's just seen so much evidence that black magic corrupts over his life that he's decided that the Laws are the best defense against it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He expresses regret when he's ordered to kill Molly in <em>Proven Guilty</em>, but still moves to follow orders until other circumstances change the situation.</span>
</li><li> In one of the books, Anastasia Luccio (Commander of the Wardens) explains to Harry that the Council <em>only</em> enforces its own Seven Laws, not national laws or moral codes — because doing otherwise would almost certainly lead to internal war between wizards. (This means, among other things, that the Council didn't take sides in World War II.) Harry himself has mused that there is nothing in the Council's laws preventing him from using magic to rob a bank.

He has a reputation in-story for being completely dedicated to justice and duty, the latter of which is the only reason he's making his bid for the Iron Throne, as it is required of him as the rightful heir.
</li><li> Barristan the Bold is very much Lawful Neutral, utterly tied to his duty as the head of the Kingsguard, and protecting the king regardless of the said king's alignment. He stuck with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaligula">the Mad King</a> to the end even though he hated it, because it was honorable to do so... and then proceeded to serve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper">The Usurper</a> just as faithfully once the war was over.

He seems to help all sides of conflict with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowledgeBroker">information he provides</a>, but it's mostly done to uphold order and stability of the kingdom (at least he claims). <em>A Dance With Dragons</em> tears down this impression of Varys; the whole time he's really been working to bring everyone down to install his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Hidden Backup Prince</a>.

<ul><li> Gunner First Class Ferik Jurgen. He is extremely loyal and duty-bound to the Imperium, and doesn't care about much outside of just that. He's not dumb, he just puts his duty above all else. Even if said duty involves "Fetching Cain a Salamander and driving him away from there as fast as possible". He also happens to be a prime example of the fact that Lawful Neutral does not mean Lawful Tidy.

Essentially, it boiled down to "Palpatine was the good guy throughout the Rebellion, because he came to power through democratic means. The fact that he turned out to be a mass-murdering psychopath hell-bent on the enslavement of all non-human species and crushing the galaxy in a durasteel fist for the rest of eternity doesn't really come into it, because legally he was supposed to be in charge."

He's a strict, no-nonsense prefect obsessed with following the rules and making sure everything runs in a neat and orderly fashion, and he initially sides with the Ministry of Magic over his own family when the two come into conflict. However, he is absolutely not a Death Eater, spends most of <em>Deathly Hallows</em> trying to keep his head down until an opportunity to backstab the corrupt Ministry arises, and does so with gusto during the final battle. He returns to the reformed Ministry after the war.
</li><li> Barty Crouch, Sr. was this, too. He was not so much opposed to Death Eaters as afraid of associating with them, and therefore ruining his reputation, so he made a big show of abandoning his son after his allegiance to Voldemort was found out.

</li><li> A lot of people initially saw Umbridge this way; even the blood-quill could be excused as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyMasterRightOrWrong">My Master, Right or Wrong</a> or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">bizarrely intense</a> drive to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">strike down rulebreakers</a>. Of course, when it came out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was the one who set the Dementor on Harry and Dudley</span>, it became clear that she wasn't just doing sick and twisted things when the Ministry told her to, but may actually just be a sick and twisted person in general. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheDeathlyHallows">Deathly Hallows</a></em>, there was no denying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">her true alignment</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NeroWolfe">Nero Wolfe</a></em> is a perfect example of a Lawful character who follows his own Law. He lives a strictly regimented and scheduled life and almost never breaks his habits, but he has little respect for the legal authorities or the rules of what society considers acceptable behaviour. He uses his genius to catch the bad guys and solve crimes, yet is also explicitly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>, putting him squarely in morally Neutral territory.

Raised by the Torturer's Guild, the ideology he learned from them, and espouses himself, is that guilt or innocence of the accused isn't of great importance; the only important factor is to carry out the appropriate sentence, neither lessening nor exceeding the cruelty demanded. Notably, when he complains about the problems with his Guild and society in general, it is to the effect that it is inefficient, rather than that people are being punished in a way that far exceeds their level of wrong-doing.
</li><li> Galad Damodred in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime">The Wheel of Time</a></em>. He plays everything strictly by the rules, even if it means getting someone else hurt or in trouble. According to his half-sister, he instantly reported any misbehavior she committed without fail, without any degree of spite. Unsurprisingly, Galad eventually joins the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> Whitecloaks, though he becomes more and more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> as series progresses.
<ul><li> He suffered a minor mental breakdown when as a newly baptised Child of the Light stumbled upon his Half-Sister Elayne, a magic using Aes Sedai on a secret mission, within the centre of the White Cloaks Power Base Amador: As a Loyal Citizen of Andor, it was his duty to Rescue Princess Elayne from thr clutches of Foreign Power. As a loving Brother it was his duty to save his half-sister and reunite her to their mother. As a Child of the Light it was his duty to arrest this agent of the Aes Sedai Witches. And as a person who stood on Amadorian Soil, it was his duty to arrest any Channeler whatsoever and present them to the Children if the Light.
</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> Empress Tuon Athaem Kore Paendrag of Seanshan also is this. Though she makes damani out of female channelers, she takes her oaths extremely seriously (for example, when Mat kidnapped her, she made a promise not to escape and did follow through it).
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> Ed the Master Shark in the second of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/YoungWizards">Young Wizards</a></em> books is, as his title implies, a giant shark who is essentially their lord and master. He likes his job, which is killing and eating things that are in distress, too slow, or not smart enough to escape him. However, he sees this as his assigned job, and is not nearly as cold as he seems. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He even performs a heroic sacrifice.</span>
</li><li> The Inquisition in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchSeries">Night Watch (Series)</a></em> is explicitly this trope; in the second book, Witieszlav tells Anton that while he personally is sympathetic to the Dark and thinks the Light is deluded, this makes no difference to how he goes about his duty, as he knows the true danger of what would happen if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedColdWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnforcedColdWar">The Treaty</a> were to collapse.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCavesOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCavesOfSteel">The Caves of Steel</a></em>, Elijah Baley questions how R. (for "robot") Daneel Olivaw could possibly understand the concept of "justice". R. Daneel explains that he defines "justice" as "that which exists when all the laws are enforced". Asked about unjust laws, he insists that "an unjust law is a contradiction in terms". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He shows a more flexible view at the end of the novel.</span>
</li><li> Andrew Harlan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheEndOfEternity">The End of Eternity</a></em> starts out this way, which makes him an ideal Technician of Eternity. He considers himself an arm of the system, sent out to observe or take action exactly as he is told, without judgement or bias. This is more or less a requirement for all Technicians, and Harlan is one of the best.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilmarillion">The Silmarillion</a></em>, Mandos, the Vala of destiny and death, is presented in this manner (and probably the only Vala apart from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> Morgoth to not be some form of good). Mandos is characterized as being merciless, but also without malice — he's an old style death-god who exists solely to perform his duty of housing souls (if they're elves) or passing them on (if they're men) and to dispense prophecy as required. He <em>was</em> moved to mercy <em>once</em> in his entire existence.
</li><li> The Vogons of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></em> are an entire race who believe in Equality Under the Law. The Guide describes them thusly:
<div class="indent"> They are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy. Not actually evil, but bad-tempered, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">bureaucratic</a>, officious and callous.
</div></li><li> The Authority First And Foremost is the standard alignment of angels and demons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens">Good Omens</a></em>. Demons are explicitly stated to not be truly evil for the most part, but they still corrupt and torture people and follow <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> to maintain the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBetweenGoodAndEvil">Balance Between Good and Evil</a>. Angels are generally obliged to do good whenever possible, but are expected to never go against their higher-ups, even if the fate of the world is on the line. Aziraphale and Crowley, the novel's main angel and demon respectively, both start off as fairly typical examples of their species, but progress to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a> (Aziraphale) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticGood">Chaotic Good</a> (Crowley).

As co-creator of the universe, he imposed structure on the raw chaos of his older sibling; however, his nature also leaves him prone to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity">Black and White Insanity</a> and makes it hard for him to change his mind, even when he knows he made a bad decision, like <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murdering one sibling and enslaving the other to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a></span>.

</div></li><li> The Clave in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMortalInstruments">The Mortal Instruments</a></em> claims to be Lawful Good, but strict and authoritarian rules and laws have concluded that they are more Lawful Neutral. In the past, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephilim">shadowhunters</a> were responsible for many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanHelsingHateCrimes">immoral acts</a>, and the Clave was even Lawful Evil.
</li><li> Despite being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockShonenHero">Stock Shōnen Hero</a>, Makoto Kozuki is more like this alignment than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> for the majority of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpectrumGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSpectrumGame">The Spectrum Game</a></em> Book I. He's Lawful because of his dedication to the vows he makes, as well as generally following the rules (to the point of never swearing once in the book, something nobody else has accomplished). As for Neutral, he's generally too good a person to be Evil, but his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevengeBeforeReason">thoughtless</a> devotion to his revenge and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt">refusal to account for Inigo's side of the story</a> stops him from being Good.

He is a sympathetic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain">Punch-Clock Villain</a> who worked for a meth dealer but who stuck rigidly to certain principles, such as never taking on too dark a job or not stealing money when it wasn't a part of his contract. His devotion to his granddaughter and daughter in law also suggests a man who is not of evil alignment, though his job working for a meth dealer doesn't make him good either.
</li><li> Sir Humphrey Appleby of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YesMinister">Yes, Minister</a></em> was mostly concerned with not making changes unless absolutely necessary and reducing the damage done by frivolous politicians, and was utterly unconcerned by things that fell outside his remit. He was also taking advantage of the system to his own ends, to keep his comfortable position at the expense of others, in a way that would make a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> character proud, and when Hacker called him a "moral vacuum," he seemed delighted. He certainly <em>sees himself</em> as Lawful Neutral and justifies his actions along such lines, but he's selfish and ruthless enough to at least veer into Evil territory at times.
<ul><li> When Hacker keeps trying to raise the moral issues around the sale of weapons which ended up in the hands of Italian red terrorists, Humphrey only cares if it intersects his office, saying the problem lies with other departments, not theirs, and that his function is not to speculate on the morality of matters currently lawful.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Hacker</strong>: Selling arms to terrorists is wrong, can't you see that?
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Humphrey</strong>: No, minister. Either you sell arms or you don't. <em>If</em> you sell them, they will inevitably end up in the hands of people who have the cash to buy them.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Humphrey</strong> (a little later): Government isn't about morality... [it's about] stability. Keeping things going, preventing anarchy. Still being here tomorrow... Government isn't about good and evil, it's only about order or chaos.

Odo is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">unusual for his species</a> in that he has been around "solid" species for almost his entire life, and he understands their needs and struggles and is more understanding about their faults. When dealing with other people, he replaces his sense of order with justice, making him bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a>. When no harm is done or laws were broken out of desperation, he can be somewhat lenient and let people off easy, but when it comes to real criminals, he is utterly and completely without mercy and does not show any preferential treatment to anyone. This makes him the perfect head of law enforcement on a space station that would most probably be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> without him. He had the same job when the station was a slave labor camp, as the prisoners knew he would not abuse suspects or threaten innocents and was more willing to talk, while the overseers had complete trust that he would never allow any committed crime to go unpunished. He also gets massively annoyed when someone gets into his office or quarters and touches or moves anything even just a little bit.

His strictly regimented lifestyle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperOCD">Super OCD</a> and tendency towards complex legal documents point towards lawful alignment, but he'll often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyer</a> his own agreements, or flat out disregard them if it serves him, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny">if it's funny</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Jack Bristow, Sydney's father on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em>, is a fascinating treatment of the alignment, because he follows two overriding concerns without question. The first, and the most important, is to keep his daughter safe; as she's an active spy and field agent, this is even less easy than it is for normal fathers. The second, due his being a spy himself, is to safeguard the economic, diplomatic, and military security of the United States (for whom his daughter works, as well). They usually go together. The fun comes when said goals clash.

</li><li> Many of the Division officials in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">24</a></em> come across as this, as they often show more concern for stopping Jack from violating regulations than they do for catching the terrorists, even when doing the former interferes with the latter.

On the other hand, you have Ron Swanson, the Libertarian head of the department, who wants to cut government to the bone and would border on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">True Neutral</a> if it weren't for him having a set of rules of his own that is <em>utterly</em> strict, and is simply 99% incompatible with the current government.

When the time comes, he points out that he never actually agreed to anything.

They are some of the foremost creations of the Old Ones, and as such are guardians of their Plans. If they attack you, it's not because they dislike you (they're quite literally incapable of malice), but it's because you are a threat to the Old Ones' Plan in some way.
</li><li> The modrons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em> (and featured most heavily in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Planescape">Planescape</a></em>) are the physical embodiments of Lawful Neutral in the game's universe. They had a regrettable tendency to be portrayed as quirky wind-up toys with an anal-retentive obsession with orderliness, but at their best the modrons — especially the more powerful ones — could be frightening alien forces that represent the concept of law in the same way that angels represent good and demons evil.
<ul><li> The plane of Mechanus (and the home of the modrons) is <em>made</em> of LN, leading to such things as:
<ul><li> Formians, who are basically <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeastWars">Beast Wars</a></em> Inferno without a robot mode. They want to enslave everything, because that way everything will be more efficient in the service of the hive.
</li><li> Inevitables, extraplanar robots who exist solely to enforce The Rules. Their purposes vary from killing anyone who tries to cheat death (adventurers who are raised once or twice are probably safe, liches and necromancers are screwed) to forcing people to abide by contracts. One Dragon Magazine article on the kolyaruts (the contract ones) stated outright that their reaction to mitigating circumstances is "The circumstances are indeed mitigating, but they are not part of the contract. You are therefore in breach". An entirely acceptable Kolyarut plot would have one interrupt the standard "rescue the princess" plot by explaining to the paladin that the princess was <em>contractually obligated</em> to remain in the villain's clutches. A more terrifying example would be the case of the Kolyarut, Obligatum. After a group of wizards summoned a powerful entity and then bound it to perform a specific task, they later stopped it and sealed it away. Obligatum was then dispatched to free said Entity because the wizards got cold feet and broke the covenant they had made with the entity. The fact that the Entity is Pandorym and is a psionic superentity tasked solely with annihilating all the gods (and possibly the whole world in the process) is utterly irrelevant to Obligatum. You don't break contracts. And there are more to replace him if he fails.

It governs the trade lanes between its member worlds. However, the member worlds are generally allowed to govern themselves as long as they do not violate Imperial standards of conduct too ostentatiously. They are even allowed to fight wars with each other as long as they don't make too much of a mess. And above all, they must never interfere with interstellar trade.

While there are still individual examples who count as Lawful Neutral, the vast majority of the guild have fallen far from this spot. To be fair, the Azorius were already bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a> before (Augustin IV was the main antagonist of <em>Dissenssion</em>, after all.

In other words, most of the members of the guild are still Lawful Neutral, with some good and bad eggs here and there.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet">Hamlet</a></em>. Much of the problems in the play are caused by his adherence to what he believes is God's law; while he doesn't particularly like the idea of killing people, he still spends the play trying to kill Claudius because he considers it his obligation to avenge his father's death. Through his obsession with carrying out this duty, Hamlet ends up getting nearly every other character killed, and he doesn't feel terribly bad about any of it. His intentional killing of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern pushes him very close to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Lawful Evil</a>, but he may have thought that they were willing co-conspirators with Claudius (and, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternativeCharacterInterpretation">depending on the production</a>, he may be correct).

<ul><li> Sister Miriam Godwinson and her Lord's Believers definitely clock in as Lawful, but whether they are Good (genuinely helping a world filled with sin towards salvation, even when evil resists that salvation), Neutral (upholding the Bible to the absolute letter without care for the meaning behind it), or Evil (fanatics out to actively purge the world of nonbelievers) is really down to how sympathetic the player is to her agenda — the game itself portrays her as aggressive but does not imply her to be good or evil.

The oath she took to protect Ashenvale is her only priority and until the last moment, she seems unwilling to compromise about anything, which almost leads to the Burning Legion's victory. After some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, she moves a bit on the axis, and in the expansion set, she's arguably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a>. Her mantle of Lawful Neutral is then passed down to Maiev Shadowsong, who herself goes absolutely nuts by the end of the expansion pack night elf campaign and turns into some kind of hybrid between all the existing alignments.
</li><li> The Titans in the backstory seem to fit the bill too. They travel the cosmos, ordering worlds. Even though we've hardly seen them in action, we've seen a lot of their servants and constructs, and they don't really seem to care that much for goodness, just the avoidance of chaos. This is best seen in characters like Algalon the Observer, an entity whose job it is to alert the Titans when Azeroth has fallen to the Old Gods' corruption. If this is found to be the case, their solution then is to completely wipe out all life on Azeroth and start from scratch. Essentially, if things don't go exactly as the Titans want them to, it's completely wrong and must be destroyed.

</li><li> Vhailor, a merciless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> who is thought to be a bit of a fanatic even by his own faction, a group of criminal-hunters called Mercykillers (so named because they want to destroy the very concept of mercy, as it interferes with proper execution of the law), is the other. However, while he would occasionally jump the gun when he had evidence, he would never prosecute anyone <em>without</em> it, and has let people who have committed terrible acts live and even go free when he thinks they have suffered punishment enough.

However, they eventually shift into Lawful Good. In the Original Generations, however, the shift differs...
<ul><li> Axel Almer starts out Lawful Neutral, being the follower of Shadow Mirror, mostly. Even though he has his heavy vendetta against Beowulf, he still obeys Vindel's orders more. In OG Gaiden, however, with his 'law' (the Shadow Mirror) destroyed, he shifts into True Neutral. His <em>Original Generation 2</em> GBA self, however, is not Lawful Neutral, but Neutral Evil, from his rampant sadism and racism and his vendetta taking more priority than Vindel's order.
</li><li> Lamia Loveless mostly follows her original self, from Lawful Neutral shifting into Lawful Good. In OG Gaiden, however, she temporarily shifts into Lawful Evil after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">being reprogrammed</a> by Duminuss. When that ordeal is over, she shifts back into Lawful Good.

In fact, Tyrael, the only angel in the games' lore who seems to be in any way good, is considered a rogue by his brethren.
<ul><li> In the last book of a novel trilogy, we meet the rest of the Council that Tyrael is on when they gather to decide the fate of humanity for <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being the offspring of angels and demons</span>. One is a fanatic Lawful Neutral who wants to wipe out the humans, another is very nice and on par with Tyrael, another seems neither particularly spiteful or sympathetic, but pragmatic and willing to give humanity the chance to prove themselves, and the last seems neutral. <em>Deathly</em> neutral.

If <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulEvil">Arcturus Mengsk</a> is in charge, she will be antagonistic, but if it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Valerian Mengsk</a> who is in charge, she will be protagonistic. When she's allowed to be herself, Nova is more about trying to make sure that the people under Dominion are safe, her accosting Raynor for siding with Tosh is more about upholding the law because a prison break may have a chance to release actually dangerous criminals that wasn't opposing Mengsk.

He hates slavers and criminals, not because it's evil, but because there's no challenge in hunting unarmed refugees. He approves if you support someone going after revenge (hey, you're helping out another hunter), or arming the prey to make hunters have to work harder (he doesn't see a problem with Force-wielding rakghouls — if they're harder to kill, they're worth more points).

The justicar's code binds her to kill those who harm innocents and save said innocents; although Samara will save a baby from a burning building and put her own life at risk, she does it because her Code demands such action and not because she wants to. Even though the code practically encourages <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">Knight Templar</a> behaviour at times, Samara has been a justicar for a very long time and is surprisingly non-self-righteous in how she views both the code and her forced adherence to it, and also knows how to use loopholes.

In many cases, a qunari's name will literally consist of their role and rank in their society, such as the case with Sten. This causes a lot of consternation for Sten himself when he enters Ferelden, where, in his own words, "no one knows their place." If the Warden is female, Sten will be confused as to whether she is a woman or a soldier, as qunari women are <em>not</em> soldiers.

<ul><li> The Spirit of Vengeance that is joined with Anders acts this way, being formerly a spirit of Justice that became corrupted by Anders' anger and bitterness toward the oppression of mages. Ultimately, Anders himself is of this alignment as well, believing that fighting the injustices against mages is worth any cost. This leads to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Anders' destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry</span> and triggering <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a full-scale war between mages and templars across Thedas</span>. Vengeance was also like this when he was introduced as Justice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOriginsAwakening">Dragon Age: Origins  Awakening</a></em>, while the two were separate entities; at one point, he accuses Anders of enslaving his pet cat.
</li><li> Aveline also tends toward Lawful Neutral. She refused to arrest a guard after he raped an elf because there was not enough evidence, but was perfectly willing to arrest the elf's two brothers who murdered her rapist, regardless of her personal feelings on the matter.

She upholds the laws of the Chantry, and while she acknowledges that there were — and are — problems with the system, she is against the rebellion. Vivienne would rather work within the rules; she can become the first mage Divine because, well, there isn't a rule that says she can't. She also comes from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>, which has its own set of arcane, unwritten rules.

<ul><li> G.U.N. started out as this, as they were willing to do almost anything to preserve world order, including imprisoning or "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverSayDie">silencing</a>" everyone involved in a failed experiment, including children. After the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowTheHedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a></em>, though, they've started to drift towards <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a>.
</li><li> While Shadow the Hedgehog fights for good, it seems that he fights more against chaos and destruction, battling <em>anybody</em> who gets in his way. Eggman as a ruler would most certainly cause chaos, which is the main reason he fights him. In the Archie arc "25 Years Later", he became king of Mobius, mercilessly stamping out any rebellion in his desire to maintain order, not so much because he selfishly wanted power, but in the belief that order — <em>his</em> order — would bring peace. Sonic even comments that Shadow may have been strict, but he sure kept the warlords in line. In the Sonic Universe arc "Treasure Team Tango", Shadow (along with Rouge and Omega) fights Team Rose for a Sol Emerald on GUN orders, even though they belong to Blaze's world, and even though he owes Blaze a favour. He lets her have it when he learns her world will be destroyed without them.
</li></ul></li><li> When you first meet Janos Audron in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Soul Reaver 2</a></em>, you might think he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeutralGood">Neutral Good</a>. Do not be fooled. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">His people</a> were a bunch of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar">knight templars</a> who waged a thousand year war against another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Precursors">ancient and powerful race</a> because said race wouldn't bow down to the vampire's god, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">banished them to another dimension</a>, raising the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmicKeystone">Pillars of Nosgoth</a> to keep them sealed and tying the health of the pillars to the land itself. When their enemies afflicted the vampires with blood thirst and undeath as revenge, they passed the curse on to humans (note that they themselves considered the curse a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a>) in order to keep their enemies banished, kidnapping children and forcing vampirism on them when they came of age. Janos' actions have enough justification, and he's a nice enough guy, to keep him from evil territory, but he's racist and morally questionable enough to keep him out of good.
</li><li> The Brotherhood of Steel from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout">Fallout</a></em> series largely fall into this category, with the exception of Lyon's Brotherhood in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, who are more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a>. They are always a lawful and orderly organization, but in the first two games, are very insular in nature. Their primary function is the preservation of technology, not saving the world, and they mostly stick to it. It is possible to get them to take some minor action in the first game, but even after you join them, getting them to help you with anything is like pulling teeth. They very much have the power to oppose the super mutants, but aren't particularly concerned with doing so. One of their doctors even determines via autopsy that the super mutants are sterile and suggests that as a result, the problem will eventually sort itself out, unconcerned with the damage they'll cause in the meantime. Their presence in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">Fallout 2</a></em> is minimal, but the attitude is similar. The Midwestern Brotherhood splinter group from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutTacticsBrotherhoodOfSteel">Fallout Tactics</a></em> is much more proactive in regards to the state of the world, but their motivation still seems primarily about re-establishing order and civilization, and they're willing to be quite ruthless about it, to the point of reinventing a sort of pseudo-feudalism and using prisoners as essentially slave labor.
<ul><li> The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> takes this to extreme levels. Here, their adherence to the codex is actually causing their own downfall, spending just about the entire game in a lockdown which in itself isn't doing much to improve the morale within the chapter. Even after Veronica, the chapter's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">voice of reason</a>, proves that the chapter's actions are wrong, they still remain in their bunker. While they can eventually be convinced to remove the lockdown and re-emerge into the wasteland, their initially overly cautious attitude is not exactly helping them in any way, as several members note during the course of the game, and depending on whether or not the NCR (the faction that they fear the most) are around, they'll proceed to become essentially tech raiders.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout4">Paladin Danse</a> can be described as Lawful Neutral. He believes that all ghouls and synths are a danger that should be wiped out, no matter what they've done or how good they are, because this is what the Brotherhood teaches. No one is above the rules, not even himself, as he is willing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">commit suicide after discovering that he is, in fact, a synth himself</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Babus from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> enforces the will of the Queen and the Prince upon the people because he believes whatever rules they make are always the right ones and that anyone who dares defy them is an enemy. It isn't until Marche manages to finally convince Babus about Prince Mewt's well being isn't healthy in Ivalice that Babus starts to lean on the side of good.
</li><li> Gauldoth Half-Dead of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HeroesOfMightAndMagic">Heroes of Might and Magic</a> IV</em> is this. Basically a necromancer who leads a kingdom of both living and undead, and goes through great trouble maintaining the balance between the two sides. He has a strict policy never to harm the living. The only two living people he ever turned into undead were a sadistic officer who wanted to burn him for being half undead and an old man whose village and entire family were compensated for his sacrifice. Both would later become his loyal underlings. Gauldoth's enemy is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> who wants to destroy the world because he's evil, but he also disapproves of people fanatically obsessed with the power of good, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByIrony">won't hold back when proving them wrong</a>.
</li><li> A lot of the races of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Halo</a></em>'s Covenant could be described as Lawful Neutral. The Sangheili/Elites are very dedicated to their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">honor codes</a>; the Mgalekgolo/Hunters as well (though not so extreme); the Yanme'e/Drones don't seem to have much individual initiative outside of their queens, and the Jiralhanae/Brutes know that questioning orders <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">will result in a very bad day</a>.

<ul><li> The Elder Gods refuse to do anything about the evil figures overrunning the realms or come to Earth's aid during Shao Kahn's invasion based on a minor technicality of the Mortal Kombat rules. They only intervene either when they are directly threatened or someone breaks the rules.

While the corporation she works for appears to be genuinely evil — not surprising, given the setting's cyberpunk elements — Symmetra herself seems to believe that order is more important than anything else, making its actions for a greater good, and has a moral centre that her handlers seem to lack — they actually express irritation when she tries to do the minimum amount of killing when pulling a "job" on another corporation.
