</div></div><p>A boss that is beaten through trickery rather than brute force. This is usually enforced by making the boss completely invulnerable to conventional attacks, forcing you to find another strategy to defeat it  which usually involves one of the following two scenarios:
</p><p></p><ul><li> One is to make use of some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">convenient feature of the arena</a> which may either directly damage the boss, or simply <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackItsWeakPoint">expose their weak spot</a> so you <em>can</em> attack it conventionally. The first case especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">raises the question</a> of how the player's conventional rocket launcher/tripmine/lightsaber/fireball spells don't manage to do any damage no matter how many attacks you land, while the environment's (often comparably lame) hazards are so intrinsically fatal.
</li><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><li> The other is to observe the boss and wait for some kind of opening that the boss's strategy <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">deliberately leaves open for you to exploit</a>. Like an attack that if successfully <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack">countered</a>  <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">Action Commands</a> optional  leaves the boss temporarily vulnerable to conventional damage. (Obviously, for gameplay purposes, the boss will seldom learn from this mistake; even when it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a>, its new attack patterns will have similar vulnerabilities the player can exploit.)
</li></ul><p>A subtrope of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientWeaknessPlacement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientWeaknessPlacement">Convenient Weakness Placement</a>. Not to be confused with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrickBoss">Trick Boss</a>, which is more about the boss's place in the story rather than the method of the boss fight itself.
</p><p>When the solution to the puzzle is to not actively fight the boss at all, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword">Sheathe Your Sword</a>. The inversion to Puzzle Boss is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>, which has no trickery at all and simply <em>is</em> worn down through brute force.

</p><p>Due to the nature of this trope, many of the examples below will be <strong>spoilers</strong>, and will almost certainly dampen the challenge if read. (Although if you're not the sort of player who likes difficulty, you probably won't care.)

<ul><li> Almost all of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LegacyOfKain">Legacy of Kain</a>: Soul Reaver</em> were some form of Puzzle Boss. Rahab, for example, could be beaten if the player shattered the windows of the chamber and let sunlight in to fry him.
<ul><li> In the case of Rahab, the game almost outright tells you to do this  if you bother to pay close enough attention to what the Elder God says when you come across the Drowned Abbey area, and a clue somewhere in either the game's voiceovers or manual, that of all the Brothers, Rahab is the most vulnerable to sunlight.
</li><li> The same is true for <em>Blood Omen 2</em>, but with a twist. The vampire bosses in that game alternate between puzzle and muscle stages. For example, in the first boss's first stage, he has to be fought, and the second stage, he has to be tricked. All the while, you're lowering his HP until he is defeated.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOStarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LEGOStarWars">LEGO Star Wars</a> II</em> does this with the Rancor. Also done to an extent somewhat against Darth Vader in the first Cloud City level; the second time you face him, you have to use the gas vents in the carbon-freezing room to stun him before you can attack.
<ul><li> Not just Star Wars, but other Lego games as well, most notably Lego Batman. Almost every boss is a Puzzle Boss!
<ul><li> Clayface in "You can Bank on Batman" has you blasting objects in the area with bombs to damage him, and for the final hit you must use a batarang to hit the little targets above him to hit Clayface with toxic gas.
</li><li> "Two-Face Chase" has you using the Batmobile to first shoot Two-Face's armored van to disable it, then tow the boss over to a spotlight to hurt him.
</li><li> "A Poisonous Appointment" has Poison Ivy, who rides in a giant plant. To get her out, you must wait for the plants to spit up Lego pieces, and use said pieces to build a bomb to blow up the plants. After that, you will be able to hurt Poison Ivy successfully.
</li><li> Man-Bat in "Zoo's Company" follows this to a T. After you beat him up a bit, you must construct a giant record player and play it to overload his hearing and bring him back down to earth, conveniently within melee range.
</li><li> Penguin and Catwoman attack in tag-team style at the end of "Penguin's Lair." You have to construct a paddle to redirect his bombs to his machine, disabling it so you can hit it with batarangs and shock him.
</li><li> Mad Hatter in "The Joker's Turf" is another obvious example; at one point you must hit switches to drop him into the toxic waste in the room, and at another, you must switch partners when he mesmerizes you to attack him.
</li><li> The Emperor had a similar trick in the Star Wars games  he'd always zap the player with Force Lightning, so you'd need to switch to the other guy and strike while he's distracted.
</li><li> "Flight of the Bat" features a battle against The Scarecrow, whom tails you constantly. You must snag him with the Batcopter's tow cable before switching to the Batwing and blasting it with a torpedo.
</li><li> Killer Moth in "In the Dark Night" suffers the same glaring weakness as Man-Bat — only instead of a record player, you have a giant light bulb that you can turn on by building the generators in the room.
</li><li> The Joker and Harley Quinn in "To the Top of the Tower" hide inside bells in the room, and can only be knocked free by ringing them. After you take down his Helicopter, you face him in melee, and like Mad Hatter, he forces you to switch characters when attacking because of his electrical joy buzzer.
</li><li> Commissioner Gordon in "A Surprise for the Commissioner" is a painfully obvious one — after you hurt him, he retreats and sends a police truck after you. You have to use the crane nearby to pick an exploding teddy bear (really) and drop it on the truck to get the boss to reappear.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MoleMania">Mole Mania</a></em> has a number of these, as one might expect from a puzzle game, though the game more or less tells you exactly what you need to do prior to the fights and it's fairly obvious even if you manage to overlook the tips, thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">Boss Arena Idiocy</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightsIntoDreams">NiGHTS</a></em>. This franchise has among the most cryptic bosses in video game history  as NiGHTS's only means of attack is the Paraloop, which is a circular vacuum attack done by tracing a full circle in the air, NiGHTS very rarely engages into direct combat. In addition, NiGHTS is invincible and can only lose by time running out, so the bosses tend to focus around stalling and wasting time rather than a blitz of powerful attacks.
<ul><li> In <em>NiGHTS: Into Dreams...</em>, the Sega Saturn game:
<ul><li> Puffy is a lagomorphic opera singer who must be thrown into a wall of crystalline spikes at the end of a long hallway, which instantly defeats her. She is invulnerable otherwise; the process of figuring this out may be long and hard for someone who doesn't already know where they are.
</li><li> Gulpo, a fish swimming around a cylinder-shaped floating glob of water, sits outside of reach of the cylinder surface NiGHTS is normally restricted to. Instead, NiGHTS has to find fish who are pointed at Gulpo. The fish launch NiGHTS into the center of the cylinder to hit Gulpo via ramming.
</li><li> Clawz is a black cat who plants dynamite sticks dressed like mice that hover in midair, then jumps around them. NiGHTS must neutralize the lit dynamite sticks before they explode by pushing them away. Normally, Clawz is very fast and can't be hit. Once there's only one dynamite stick left, Clawz is vulnerable.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em>NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams</em>, the Wii game, all of the bosses are fought through nonconventional means:
<ul><li> Donbalon plays very much like Puffy, except his arena is vertical instead of horizontal. The spikes lie at the top. Neither Puffy nor Donbalon deal any direct attacks; they passively wait for NiGHTS to run out of time.
</li><li> Chamelan hides behind a veil that completely covers the background. The Paraloop will cause a circular hole in the veil the size of the Paraloop, but it closes over time. In order to find Chamelan, the player needs to identify rows of playing cards behind the veil in order of value; Chamelan will be hiding behind the ace that's transparent. There is a rematch later on where multiple rows of cards with aces pointing in different spots; the opaque aces trigger bombs with very large blast radii. Chamelan's disguise is blown when a Paraloop happens in front of him; he is defeated with a second Paraloop.
</li><li> Cerberus is a pair, and in the rematch, a trio of dogs chained together. They can only take damage if NiGHTS grabs the center of the chain, marked by a yellow ball, and pushes the ball to ram the heads together. The third dog, which only shows up in the rematch, sprouts from this yellow ball whenever NiGHTS gets close, forcing NiGHTS to act quickly before it can fully transform.
</li><li> Girania is a monstrous fish that can swim inside the ground. It must be pushed on the forehead when it leaps up in an attempt to swallow NiGHTS, which transforms it into a cloud of colorful spheres. NiGHTS must then use the Paraloop to suck in the spheres via the vacuum created through this attack. Girania wll eventually re-form itself, though the number of spheres left is directly proportional to its size. A sufficiently small Girania will be defeated through a Paraloop.
</li><li> Bomamba is a witch with a lot of black cats. She creates a triangular platform with holes that NiGHTS can't reach but can tilt by pushing or pulling on one of its knobs. In order to defeat Bomamba, all of the black cats must fall into the holes in the triangular platform. This causes the platform to vanish and Bomamba to fall into her cauldron below. In the rematch, Bomamba creates a second and harder platform after the first one disappears, along with a second wave of cats.
</li><li> Queen Bella is a giant spider dressed in gothic lolita who crawls above NiGHTS's reach. She goes above NiGHTS and drops balls of silk. NiGHTS needs to grab this ball and throw it at the platforms around the arena. A silk ball destroys any chunk of platform it hits and will bounce, potentially destroying more platforms like a wraparound <em>Breakout</em>. Queen Bella is defeated when she has no platforms left to stand on and falls into the lava below.
</li><li> Even Reala, NiGHTS's rival, isn't defeated traditionally. In both fights, the arena is filled with balls the size of Donbalon. The only way for NiGHTS to damage Reala, and Reala to NiGHTS, is to launch one of these balls by throwing them and then hit the other Nightmaren.
</li><li> Wizeman is the final boss of the game. He assumes three forms. One is set underwater and automatically changes NiGHTS into the Dolphin persona. NiGHTS needs to dodge the whirlpools and get to Wizeman to damage him. Another phase involves an asteroid field. Here, Wizeman is very far away and can only be reached in time if NiGHTS changes into the Rocket persona. The third phase involves fireballs and strong winds, where NiGHTS must use the Dragon persona, who's immune to wind effects. In each instance, pushing NiGHTS against Wizeman and dashing in an attempt to ram him isn't enough. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Both Will and Helen, the two kids assuming the form and powers of NiGHTS, must ram into Wizeman at the same time to damage him.</span>
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The first boss battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/XMen">X-Men</a>: Wolverine's Revenge</em> was against a mutant who healed faster than you could kill him using normal attacks (and if you did get his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeMeter">Life Meter</a> down to near zero, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">the computer would cheat</a> to buy him healing time); you had to throw him against a fuel tank at one end of the room, which on the third iteration would explode, stunning him and letting you finish him off.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry4">Devil May Cry 4</a></em> you're in for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSponge">very long fight</a></em> against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Agnus</a> if you don't figure out you need to throw the Gladius demons at the glass protecting him to do any more than mere <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> to it.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder1');">    Action Adventure </div><div class="folder" id="folder1" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark1992" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/AloneInTheDark1992">Alone in the Dark (1992)</a></em>, the stairway is blocked by a pair of Lovecraftian Nightgaunts, who are invincible to physical attacks and can only be defeated by their own reflections. Got either of the mirrors broken by a monster? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Too bad!</a>
</li><li> Most of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aquaria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Aquaria">Aquaria</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Energy Temple boss can't be harmed by you (shooting him will only push him back). You can, however, damage him by shooting the trigger for a special energy beam generator while the boss is over the generator, thus sending a beam of pure energy straight through him. The catch is that the boss wises up to this after the first two times you hit him with the beam, and can't be lured over it again. The solution? Simply <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">charge up your shot, then trick him into sending his arm out to claw you. The arm then comes lashing out at you, right into the path of the beam. Simply fire, and...</span>
</li><li> And again later in the game, when you fight Mithala (a beast 15+ times the size of the protagonist!) Your shots won't even push him back this time, and there's nothing that can damage the boss nearby. However, the boss regularly releases mermen that swim at you to attack you. If you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">lure the mermen down to a pit at the bottom of the screen, they'll turn into poisonous, bloated mermen that you can drag around. The boss regularly does an attack where he sucks in water with his mouth, dragging you in to try to swallow you. If you place bloated mermen so the boss will swallow them when he next draws in...</span>
</li><li> Topped once again even later in the game, where you fight two monsters: an unstoppable juggernaut with hammers for hands, and a wraith who hovers around (and comforts) the first monster. The juggernaut is invulnerable to just about anything you throw at him. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he occasionally releases a special pink jellyfish from his head. If you eat this jellyfish in Beast Form, you get 1 special orange shot. It won't damage the monster, but it'll knock the wraith temporarily out of commission — then, your normal Energy Form shot will cause loads of damage.</span>

Jam his freeze gun? He'll rewrite its coding to prevent it. Glide kick him? He makes sure the air's too dense to allow gliding. It goes into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> levels when you do this in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, where you have to use <em>at least eleven techniques to win</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioforge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Bioforge">BioForge</a></em>: There are two or three of these. Though you must engage in actual combat with the cyber-raptor, you can't beat it until you knock it onto the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DilatingDoor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DilatingDoor">Dilating Door</a> on the floor and open the door, dropping it into a cryo tank where it will fight with another unbeatable monster serving as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeefGate">Beef Gate</a>. Later on, there is another acid-dwelling monster that you must blow up with a missile from a crashed dropship.
</li><li> Just about every boss in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em> series is this, starting with the Hydra, which you defeat by pinning the smaller heads to the deck before impaling the main head on a ship mast. Another is a giant Minotaur that is defeated by stunning it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionCommands">Action Commands</a> before using a cannon that fires flaming logs to break his armor. They show up frequently in the sequel as well, the greatest example of which involves trapping two of the fates in between dimensions by hurling them into a mirror and then shattering it, as well as pinning down Clotho's hands before using a pendulum to stab her in the head. There is also the Colossus of Rhodes, who is only defeated via draining Kratos' godly energy that had been transferred into it. The final bosses of each game, Ares and Zeus, are fairly straightforward fights, as are Theseus, the Barbarian King and Eurayle in the second game.
</li><li> Similar to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em> above it, all of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Darksiders">Darksiders</a></em> bosses are puzzle bosses instead of straight up brawls.
</li><li> In the battle against the Shadow Queen at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ico">ICO</a>,</em> she does nothing except emit waves that 1-hit kill you (which only the spirit sword and the 2 movable statues can protect you from) while hiding behind her shield. Every time you attack her, the shield weakens but the spirit sword is knocked flying from your hands by the shock, forcing you to retrieve it using the statues.
</li><li> Iosa the Invincible from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Iji">Iji</a></em> is, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">Exactly What It Says on the Tin</a>. You can damage her exoskeleton with your guns, but you're better off using the ceiling-mounted lasers against her. Once the exoskeleton is destroyed, you have to wait for an opening to knock her into the wall, which stuns her long enough to hack into and deactivate her nanoshield controller. Then the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoryDiscretionShot">cuts to black</a>, and you hear the Shotgun firing.
<ul><li> Similarly, the previous boss, the Sentinel, is a spherical satellite-like robot that throws explosive bullets and missiles everywhere, continuously tracks you, and takes half damage from ALL of your weapons. The trick here is to kick it into one of the two electrical fences at the sides of the arena for massive damage (and a few of the next spoken lines change accordingly to how much damage you took and how soon you figured out the trick).
<ul><li> Alternately, NOT using the electropods grants you a Supercharge, but you have to know how to juggle it to minimize its use of the Nuke, which blows five of your Health units straight to hell. The Velocithor does full damage to it regardless of all that armor, which makes it useful when the Sentinel's powering up the Nuke.
</li></ul></li><li> A few bosses can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkippableBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkippableBoss">skipped entirely</a> if you're needing that pacifist run. But you need to figure out how to do that.
</li></ul></li><li> Quite a few bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> series require odd strategies and unique weapon usages to defeat them. Often, the boss's defenses have to be weakened with a secondary weapon or tool, usually the one you just got in the dungeon, before more conventional attacks can be used to deal actual damage (as with the Helmasaur King from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a></em>; King Dodongo and Morpha from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></em>; the King of Ikana Castle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaMajorasMask">The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask</a></em>, and Gohma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>). Other bosses (Agahnim, Twinrova, Phantom Ganon, Ganondorf himself in some incarnations) have to have their attacks reflected before they can be damaged, sometimes resulting in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTennisWithTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTennisWithTheBoss">Playing Tennis with the Boss</a> before the blast hits.
<ul><li> The version of Ganondorf from <em>Wind Waker</em> can only be defeated by having the computer-controlled Zelda bounce Light Arrows off your Mirror Shield and then <em>immediately</em> attacking with the sword.
</li><li> Smog, from Crown Dungeon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">Oracle of Ages</a></em>, is the most blatant example, involving a classic puzzle-like interface followed by a brief encounter with the real boss, who is less capable of defending himself than normal foes.
</li><li> And there's Fraaz, from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSpiritTracks">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a></em>, who at first can be harmed using the fire and ice torches in his arena. Halfway through the battle, he destroys both of them, but starts using a new attack that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">works just as well.</a>
</li><li> The stone golem boss of the eighth dungeon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleOfAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleOfAges">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages</a></em> is this in spades. He has four forms, each of which has no obvious weak point and must be defeated via clever use of an item  a different item for each form. Fortunately, astute players may notice that the four obstacles blocking the door to his room are overcome with these same four items...

To quote Technus: "We have to find a way <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WombLevel">inside that plant!</a>" (And that way is to get to a certain spot where it will swallow you.) And the plant adapts, as its giant roots will block the previous path you took to get to that area and leave open the next one after each round of whacking its innards. There's a reason why you have to get there in order to be eaten. (Hint: The name of the boss, the battle takes place in a mall, and you're stuck with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> and Technus. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossdresser">Go figure.</a>)
</li></ul></li><li> All bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightmareCreatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NightmareCreatures">Nightmare Creatures</a></em> are puzzle bosses. One needs to have a ceiling dropped onto it before it becomes vulnerable.

The final boss cannot be damaged, only stunned, and must be killed by decapitation while he's stunned.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em> had a spider boss which could only be harmed after tying its back to three floating hooks, a flaming skeletal monster that could only be damaged after the fires were put out, a a kitsune that could only be injured by using lightning strikes against it, and a dragon that you had to get drunk.
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, Yami, is very guilty of this since, chances are, you'll be using <em>all</em> of your brush powers as you get them back.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In inverse, one boss battle in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheLegendOfJackSparrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanTheLegendOfJackSparrow">Pirates of the Carribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow</a></em> requires that the players set fire to a ship's mast to cover their escape. Rather than using the arena to kill the boss, the players must use the boss to destroy the arena: The mast is protected by an indestructible (by them) steel plate, which the players can remove only by provoking the ship's captain into using his ultimate attack while nearby.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PrinceOfPersia1">Prince Of Persia 1</a></em> has two, the first a battle against a single <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemBones">skeleton that springs to life</a> when the Prince goes near it (all other skeletons seen in the game are merely 'decorative'), which cannot be injured by your sword in the conventional fashion. The only way to dispatch it is to batter it back towards the nearest ledge and knock it off into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottomlessPit">Bottomless Pit</a>. Later in the game, you encounter the ghostly copy of the Prince, which was earlier created by a magic mirror. It mimics your actions, so attacking causes it to strike you as well — additionally, there was a red herring 'pit trap' nearby; luring the boss into it (à la the skeleton) causes you to die as well. The only solution is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword">Sheathe Your Sword</a>, with the copy doing the same.
</li><li> All of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShadowOfTheColossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a></em> are defeated in this manner. All of them involve climbing onto the boss, though how you do this and what you do afterward varies by the boss.
</li><li> The Geb Queen from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SphinxAndTheCursedMummy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SphinxAndTheCursedMummy">Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy</a></em> is a particularly complex example. At most times, she is completely invulnerable, being surrounded by a glowing shield. There's an unreachable platform above her that contains two monster cages, holding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader">Personal Space Invaders</a> and a shielded crown. One of her attacks, however, is shooting blue magical spells that turn you into a frog. You <em>have</em> to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidityIsTheOnlyOption">hit by said spells</a>, use the frog's extra jumping power to leap up to the platform, and press the buttons next to the cages, releasing the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PersonalSpaceInvader">Personal Space Invaders</a>. They'll attack the queen in the way they do, leaving her vulnerable to a strike. In later rounds, the queen starts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlunkyBoss">summoning mooks</a>, who will kill the spiderlike enemies if you don't defeat them first.

<ul><li> The Rhino in a number of games is a Puzzle Boss — his skin/suit thing is too tough for Spidey to hurt, so defeating him tends to rely on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BullfightBoss">directing his charging attacks</a> into appropriately hard/zappy items.

In order to render him vunerable, you have to make him fire a bolt at a generator, damaging his power-up device. The fact that he doesn't stop falling for this is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> by Spidey himself if the fight drags on for longer than necessary, and at the end, he simply quips "This goes to show that good wins because... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsDumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsDumb">Evil Is Dumb</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TitanSouls">Titan Souls</a></em> is filled with this.

</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaider">Tomb Raider</a></em> had an alien boss which copied Lara's movements. Shooting at it caused Lara's health to go down as well, resulting in a simultaneous death. The only way to defeat it was to position Lara so that the alien, on their side of the room, walked into a pit. The recent "Anniversary" remake once again features the same boss, with the added complications of having to "cooperate" with the Doppelgänger in order to seal its fate.

</li><li> In fact, most <em>Tomb Raider</em> bosses are Puzzle Bosses. Examples: The Dragon of Xian in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderII">Tomb Raider II</a></em>, where you must put the dragon to sleep, then remove the dagger, causing him to revert to human form. Sophia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderIII">Tomb Raider III</a></em>, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, and you must electrocute her by shooting the fuse box (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>?). Dr. Willard's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> spider form in the same game, which can only be temporarily stunned, until you have all the meteor fragments. The ghost and statue boss in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheAngelOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderTheAngelOfDarkness">Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness</a></em>. Finally, the first battle with the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere">unknown entity</a>" in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderLegend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderLegend">Tomb Raider: Legend</a></em>, which involves a lot of switches, electrical orbs, and a Tesla gun.
</li><li> Pretty much all the bosses in <em>Tomb Raider: Anniversary</em> are puzzle bosses. An example is when you are fighting two centaurs that can turn you to stone. You must use a shield to reflect their spell and turn <em>them</em> into stone, then use the opportunity to attack them.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Action RPG </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Boktai">Boktai</a></em>, the only boss that this wasn't an option for was Hel. Every other boss had something in their arena that made their fights a heck of a lot easier; for example, the Count <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">happens to have two skylights in his move path</span>, Carmilla <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">takes massive damage from her own petrification shots</span>, etc.
</li><li> The Crest Guardians in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveFencerMusashi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BraveFencerMusashi">Brave Fencer Musashi</a></em> seem to be specifically designed to be beaten by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalPowers">elemental crest</a> they guard: a fire monster guards the water crest, an ice monster guards the fire crest, etc. Apart from them, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> can only be defeated through a strategy that is rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">annoying</a> to figure out: while it is floating around between attacks, the player must <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">throw the Fusion sword at it and "Assimilate" it, temporarily shrinking it into a small, attackable orb.</span> Consider that its vulnerable period lasts for about a second or less, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Assimilate has a charge time</span>, and you'd probably never think to do it because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">assimilating an enemy usually kills it instantly, and like any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessUsefulSpell">Useless Useful Spell</a>, would be expected not to work on bosses. Which, apart from this one battle, it doesn't.</span>
</li><li> The Virgin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkDevotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkDevotion">Dark Devotion</a></em> is immune to conventional attacks. She can only be harmed by praying at the statues on either side of her, with each completed praying taking off one segment of her health bar. Of course, those statues are within striking distance of her monstrous limbs
</li><li> The Bed of Chaos in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSouls">Dark Souls</a></em> will die from a single hit. The challenge of the fight is exposing its weak point. You must destroy the big obvious glowing orbs on either side of the boss to break its shield and then run towards the crumbling center of the room and land on the root leading to the boss' weak point. The Bed of Chaos gets progressively more aggressive as it becomes vulnerable: it attacks you using its huge branch arms, destroys the floor of the arena to drop you into bottomless pits, and rains fire on you.
</li><li> The Executioner's Chariot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/DarkSoulsII">Dark Souls II</a></em> can be defeated in two ways. Pulling the lever seen in the cutscene will send the Chariot crashing into the lowered gate, which destroys the chariot and rider and leaves the demonic horse as a more conventional boss fight. Using spells and ranged attacks to damage the Chariot as it rides around the corridor is another option. The horse will become too injured to jump over the gap in the corridor. As the horse desperately clings to the edge, a few blows are all it takes to knock it down.
<ul><li> You fight Mytha like a regular boss, but she becomes much harder to fight if you don't solve a puzzle <em>before</em> entering her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRoom">Boss Room</a>: the room starts off being full of poison that constantly damages you while healing her, unless you get rid of it by taking a torch to the windmill that powers the pumps throughout the building.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkSoulsIII">Dark Souls III</a></em> has the boss fights against Yhorm the Giant, the Ancient Wyvern, and High Lord Wolnir. All of them <em>can</em> be killed by hitting them with your sword, but it'll take forever. However, Yhorm takes extreme damage from the Weapon Art of the Storm Ruler, a copy of which is conveniently located in his boss fight room <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and another copy of which is located in the hands of your friend Siegward of Catarina, who will join you for the fight if you've been following his personal questline</span>. Wolnir has three large and shiny bracelets; destroying them will take off a giant whack of health each, and finish him off when you've taken out all three. And the Ancient Wyvern's boss arena is a sprawling game of Snakemen and Ladders, at the top of which is an opportunity to leap onto the Wyvern's head and one-shot him with a lethal diving attack.
</li><li> The entirety of Tecmo's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deception">Deception</a></em> series is puzzle bosses, as every enemy must be defeated with a number of available "traps" (environmental hazards). The hero of the first game gets a sword that does pin-prick damage, but it's all puzzles from there.
</li><li> The Dragon God in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DemonsSouls">Demon's Souls</a></em> can only be defeated by taking advantage of the environment to avoid its attacks long enough to fire a pair of huge ballistas into its shoulders. Once that's done the near helpless dragon can be killed with a few blows to the face.
</li><li> The Golem in the Cantlin chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders">Dragon Quest Builders</a></em> can't be harmed by any of your regular weapons. Instead, you have to block its attacks with a large, mobile Cantlin Shield, and then bomb it with Wrecking Balls when it's vulnerable — one to knock it off its feet, and then another to deal damage.
</li><li> Several boss monsters in <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGames/DungeonSiege" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGames/DungeonSiege">Dungeon Siege</a> 2</em> and especially in <em>Dungeon Siege 2: Shattered World</em>, including the final mega-boss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KingdomHearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></em>, Hercules is normally invincible during his one-on-one arena duel with Sora, but can be made vulnerable by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowABarrelAtIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThrowABarrelAtIt">tossing barrels at him</a>.
<ul><li> And then, in the same game, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in Neverland, who is also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss">Time-Limit Boss</a>. He can set a 12-second timer above your party members' heads. When it gets down to 0, they disappear for the rest of the battle, and you can't get them back. After killing both of your party members, he'll do it to you, too. The trick to beating him is to use Stopra on Big Ben. As an insult to injury, the prize for beating the Phantom is Stopga, the strongest Stop-spell, meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BraggingRightsReward">you get the spell just after you could have really used it</a>.
</li><li> Not to mention certain bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHeartsII">Kingdom Hearts II</a></em>, like Oogie Boogie (knock toys into the basket), Demyx (find a way to kill his clones fast), and Luxord (exploit your third-person perspective to cheat at cards). More may qualify, depending on how much you view use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PressXToNotDie">Reaction commands</a> as a requisite for being a puzzle boss.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarvelUltimateAlliance">Marvel Ultimate Alliance</a></em> has:
<ul><li> The Kraken, which needs to be tricked into damaging one of four pillars surrounding it, followed by a QTE sequence that causes it to topple the rest of the pillar onto itself.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a>'s arch-enemy, the Mandarin. After whaling on him for a while, he retreats to a safe balcony; follow him through a teleporter and the Ultimo up there will send you back. To prevent this, you have to lure a spider bot to a teleporter, after which it will blow up on the Ultimo, allowing you to get up there.
</li><li> Arcade's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a>, which can only be defeated by luring him onto the giant target on the floor, then jumping through one of the trapdoors so you get shot out of a cannon onto his head, followed by button-mashing to push back his fist until he punches himself in the face.
</li><li> The Destroyer Armor, which gets its ultimate attack charging up if you dare to attack it. You have to go through the four warps and defeat the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">Mooks</a> inside, after which you will stumble upon Loki's frozen body. Trick the Armor into unleashing said move on him and they both die.
</li><li> In a strange subversion (of sorts), MODOK's battle begins with him asking trivia questions. Right answers let you get closer to him, while wrong answers get you electrocuted. After you reach him (or he runs out of questions), it turns into a standard boss battle, though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> has a stone golem boss which you have to re-animate and then kill <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using pillars surrounding it that generate lightning bolts</span> (you can kill it very quickly this way). The monster can also be killed by conventional weaponry, but this will take a long, long, <em>long</em> time. A skilled player can keep hacking at it and dodging its attacks until it dies, so this makes it a Puzzle Boss or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">Marathon Boss</a> depending on how the player tries to kill it.
</li><li> Tigris Cantus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou">The World Ends with You</a></em> is a major and overly elaborate case of this. You even get a phone message beforehand containing a cryptic hint at how to damage her. Initially, Neku can only harm her by knocking Taboo Noise into the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaintingTheMedium">static at the bottom of his screen</a>, and keeping obstacles (which harm Beat) and regular Noise (which heal Konishi) off it, while Beat attacks her on the top screen. After being damaged enough, she teleports between both screens and is fair game to both characters, but is invisible in the top screen until right before she teleports. After being damaged further, she steals all of Neku's pins and can only be harmed by Beat, but Neku can help out by stepping into her shadow, causing one of the clones she uses to block Beat to disappear every time he does so; however, he has to keep her from touching his shadow with hers, which harms Neku. Eventually she drops the Rhyme pin and turns almost completely invisible... except you can use Neku's shadow to estimate her position and make her visible by hitting her with the Rhyme pin.
<ul><li> Vespertilio/Pterupus Canor. In the beginning of the fight, the giant bat noise will be shrouded in darkness, invincible to normal attack. The strategy? Use your partner to trash the gabbabats blocking the lights on the second floor of the stage to illuminate the place. With said lights on, Verpertilio will become vulnerable and eventually stunned, ready for a plummeling.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ys">Ys</a> IV: Mask of the Sun</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Eldeel</a> is invincible during the first phase of the battle. After dodging his attacks for a minute, you get a prompt to throw the Necklace on him to render him vulnerable. In his third phase, he gains nigh-impenetrable armor, and you must dodge him again until the Disciples break it for you.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">notorious</a> Hell House in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIIRemake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em> turns into one of these. Once its health gets low enough, it starts activating God House Mode, which reduces all of your hits to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> and causes all physical hits to bounce off. God House Mode wears off very briefly during or after an attack, during which you must cast Magic at it to stun it and initiate Pressure state. However, as Hell House is <em>also</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">Barrier Change Boss</a>, you must use Magic opposite of its current element to get the stun, and if you fail to get the stun, it reactivates God House Mode almost immediately. Using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyScan">Assess</a> and choosing the right Materia for the fight can make the battle a breeze, but not doing so can turn it into a <em>horrible</em> slog.

It's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimaxBoss">Climax Boss</a> battle against Shredder about halfway through the game. Rather than fighting you himself, as is his custom in the video games, Shredder instead battles you in some sort of Dimension X war machine thing. He himself is shown in the far foreground, and cannot be hit using normal attacks. Fortunately, he's also flooding the arena with Foot Soldiers, who the Turtles can actually throw into the camera, which in this case damages Shredder. Can be a SLIGHT case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>, because this is the only point in the game where this skill does anything more than insta-killing the Foot Soldier for three points.

One of the most popular is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Miko">Sanae</a>'s "Bumper Crop Rice Shower" spellcard; it's possible to stay at the bottom and dodge the random bullets that fall down on you, but it's much easier to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">place yourself directly on the spot from which Sanae spawns red bullets.

Several of her spells have gimmicks not usually seen until endgame, such as actively chasing you around the screen.

Instead, you must avoid her attacks while triggering the mechanism that will open the bay doors to Space, then make it to a small room and close the door before the bay door opens so that you don't get sucked out into Space along with the Queen.

She's immune to any conventional attacks, but the SCAR gun can knock her back down. Beating her requires opening the doors of the elevator shaft behind her, and knocking her back enough times to make her fall in it to her death.
</li><li> Some players approach the Big Daddy battles in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BioShock1">BioShock</a></em> like this (kind of a "DIY" Puzzle Boss). Rather than just fight the brutes head on and unload as much lead as they can muster, they will lay a long line of things to trap and damage the Big Daddy as it comes barreling at them. Explosions, electricity, and other objects on the land make for great Big Daddy roadblocks. It's all in how you set it up that determines how much damage can be done by the time he's made his way through your gauntlet of pain.
</li><li> All of the bosses in <em>Chasm: The Rift</em>
</li><li> A lot of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CliveBarkersUndying">Clive Barker's Undying</a></em> are pretty much invincible until they run out of juice. While you do fight Lizbeth normally, she eventually goes invincible with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Limit Break</a>, and you have to wait for her to tucker out before you can take her head off. Ambrose gets all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThe50FootWhatever">gigantimous</a>, and you have to wait until he's distracted so that you can hit his weak point to stun him long enough for a decapitation. Aaron is invulnerable until one of his spears gets stuck, at which point you rush in and finish him off. Bethany likewise can only be decapitated after she becomes tired out from summoning a minion. In fact only Keisinger is fought as a straightforward boss fight with no puzzle elements.
</li><li> A number of bosses in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DarkForcesSaga">Dark Forces Saga</a></em> are this, notably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoSerum">Psycho Serum</a>-infused Rancor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy">Jedi Academy</a></em>.
</li><li> The raid activities in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGame">Video Game</a>/Destiny</em> have bosses that require coordination between 6 fireteam members instead of just shooting. Atheon, Time's Conflux is a giant invulnerable machine that requires a buff in order to damage normally, and an artifact to protect the party from it's normally fatal attacks. Crota, Son of Oryx is a giant knight that is invulnerable to conventional firearms. The only way to damage him is to use a sword to strike him, but Crota instantly kills any party member who approaches him. The trick being that it's the job of the party to stun him in order to allow the sword user to attack Crota without fear of getting counter attacked. Oryx, The Taken King is on another level.
<ul><li> The sequel takes this to another level, as the raid puzzles get more complex and require precise timing as well as good communication. Some of the regular bosses also have puzzles that enable the players to damage them, but most are pretty straightforward.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a> 3</em> had two bosses. The first is the Guardian, which is blind and relies on small floating demons in the arena to see, so you had to kill all of them and the Guardian will spawn more, revealing his weak spot for you to attack. The final boss — the Cyberdemon — could only be hurt by the Soul Cube, and the only way to use it was to kill the enemies that constantly spawned around the arena while avoiding the Cyberdemon's rockets. Once you have killed a sufficient number of enemies, the Soul Cube is fully charged and can be used.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife1">Half Life 1</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Tentacle required you to explore the silo activating fuel lines and turning on the power generator for the rocket motor above the creature's head, and then burn it.
</li><li> The first Gargantua had to be lured into a massive electricity generator and electrocuted, while later on in the game, another Gargantua had to be led into an open area where you used a tactical map to call air-strikes on it. Gargantuas are susceptible to explosives damage, so if you are inclined to do so, a full supply of grenades and explosive packs is <em>just</em> enough to kill each of them. It's kind of a waste, though.
</li><li> The final boss was immune to all damage until you destroyed the energy crystals around it, whereupon its head would pop open, allowing you to shoot its exposed brain.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeOpposingForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLifeOpposingForce">Half-Life: Opposing Force</a></em> has a fight similar to the Tentacle Creature, where you have to activate the drainage system of a huge septic tank to flush the monster away.
</li><li> In the same game, the Gene Worm at the end must first be shot in the eyes with two conveniently placed crystal-enhanced laser turrets, and then shot in the stomach. And you have to do this same process <em>multiple times</em>. Not a lot of people liked this particular boss.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NoOneLivesForever">No One Lives Forever</a></em>, defeating an otherwise invulnerable Inge Wagner requires the player to repeatedly electrify a pool of water and lure her across it (taking advantage of the moments when Wagner would burst into her much-dreaded singing, which temporarily disabled the otherwise endlessly spawning goons in the level, was an available if not crucial option in accomplishing the first part of this maneuver).
</li><li> With the exceptions of Necrogiant, the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Painkiller">Painkiller</a></em> fall into this category. Detonating bubbles is needed to make Swamp Thing vulnerable, as is destroying Guardian's hammer. Alastor's statues can heal him and make him invincible  and can't be dealt with unless they're doing so. Then there's your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTennisWithTheBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingTennisWithTheBoss">tennis date</a> with Lucifer. In the expansion pack <em>Battle Out Of Hell</em>, all the bosses are of this category. For better or worse, in the follow-up <em>Overdose</em>, only the first of the three bosses was of this type.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prey2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Prey2006">Prey (2006)</a></em> had two examples:
<ul><li> The Centurion takes minimal damage from conventional weapons; the way to defeat it was to hide in a corridor and wait for it to reach in to grab you, then activate the forcefield that will sever its arm as well as the cannon grafted on, allowing you to deal much more damage to the monster using its own weapon.
</li><li> The final boss has an impenetrable shield, and the only way to hurt it was to launch mines from conveniently placed mine launchers around the arena and destroy them when the boss got near, momentarily disrupting her shield and allowing you to attack with conventional weapons.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RainbowSix">Rainbow Six</a>: Vegas 2</em>, of all things, has one of these with a helicopter gunship. Being a helicopter, your weapons are pretty much entirely useless against it, so the best you can do is hide behind cover to avoid its weapons and worry about the guys on the ground who can flank you. You get a call not too long into the battle from Jo, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl">Mission Control</a> for Logan from the first <em>Vegas</em>, telling you that they've hacked into local air defenses and can shoot down the helicopter for you if you can make it call for backup to give them something to lock on to. The trick is then to open fire on it just enough for it to panic and call for reinforcements, switching to the correct cover as necessary when it launches instant-kill missiles at you, then repeat this at the next set of cover until it opens a path into the tennis court it was hovering over so you can head in and take better cover inside a building. At that point it's simply a matter of holding out against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">a ridiculous amount of bad guys</a> while hiding from the copter's weapons, until eventually the missile comes in and shoots it down.
</li><li> The final boss of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam</a>: The First Encounter</em> was a combination normal boss and puzzle boss. Ugh-Zan III had a lifebar, and he could be damaged normally — until he was in the red, at which point he regenerated progressively faster the more damaged he was, making conventional weapons useless. The player has to bring his health down and keep it there while activating a large laser on a spaceship above, which does enough damage to kill Ugh-Zan before he can regenerate.
<ul><li> Ugh-Zan IV from <em>Serious Sam 3</em> is also a puzzle boss. He has regeneration much like the previous Ugh-Zan, which really kicks in if the player manages to knock him down past half his health. The trick is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">shoving metal poles into his back every time he loses interest in you and fights the sand whale instead. This attracts lightning to him, which does heavy damage and disables his regeneration for a short time</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Both bosses in the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Quake">Quake</a></em> are Puzzle Bosses. Chthon, the big lava monster you fight at the end of the first episode, is only killable by lowering two big pillars level with Chthon's head and then hitting the button that triggers the lightning. In easy modes, only one blast is necessary to kill him, but on the hard modes, you need three of them. The final battle with Shub-Niggurath is particularly anti-climactic. There's a little pod thing that goes around the chamber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookMaker">dropping off monsters for you to kill</a> and at one point passes through Shub's sluglike body. Entering the transporter at that point warps you into her body and telefrags her.
<ul><li> It used to be possible to kill Shub-Niggurath with conventional weapons, but this has been patched.

The way to defeat it is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">run across its chamber, using the pillars as cover from its claw attacks. Pressing the button at the far end of the chamber causes a chemical spray to irritate the creature so that it breaks a window and opens the way to a control room. Using the "feed" button in the control room causes the creature's stomach to rupture, killing it. The released gastric juices burn a hole in the floor  guess where you're headed next?</span>

The latter encounter is followed by a literal puzzle: a game of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29">mastermind<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em>: For the first few dungeons, the boss battles are mostly just harder encounters, but they quickly ramp up in complexity.
<ul><li> The first dungeon, the Ascalonian Catacombs, has the lovers, Ralena and Vassar. Both are surrounded by circles and when they overlap they gain 'Lover's Embrace', which significantly boosts their stats. Players either need to focus fire on one to kill them off quickly, use boulders to knock them apart or use the pressure plate door to separate them (sacrificing a team member in the process). This boss battle is especially devastating since it's among the first that new players will do.
</li><li> Twilight Arbor features the final boss battle against Faolain, who summons illusionary copies of Destiny's Edge, then disappears. Players need to defeat a copy, prompting Faolain to return to the battlefield to revive it  unless she is damaged quickly enough, the copy comes back.
</li><li> Happens more obviously against the Iron Forgeman in Sorrow's Embrace, which is impervious to regular attacks and deals massive damage. Players need to stay safely behind walls (although the Forgeman also pours lava onto these spots, so one has to keep moving) and defeat the flame jellies that are thrown out. These then turn into boulders which can be thrown for massive damage. It's possible for one skilled player to solo this battle, but it causes problems to those who don't know the technique to use.
</li><li> The Citadel of Flame has two. The first is the flame effigy, which has a team of Flame Acolytes that are invulnerable to attacks. Players must attack the effigy first. Once it is down to 75% health, the Acolytes heal it, becoming vulnerable to attack themselves. The cycle has to be repeated several times before the effigy can be properly damaged.
<ul><li> Gaheron Baelfire is somewhat similar to the Iron Forgeman. Players must remain within Logan's shield while Gaheron rolls down flaming boulders, which break upon impact with the shield and leave molten hearts. Then they have to pick up the molten hearts (which cause constant damage while held) and carefully navigate along the platform while avoiding boulders until they're close enough to throw the molten heart at Gaheron, who returns momentarily to mortal form and can then be damaged by normal attacks. Once down to half health, Gaheron also summons molten barriers which have to be broken in order to approach him.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomOfLoathing">Kingdom of Loathing</a></em>: the majority of the battles in the Naughty Sorceress's castle. The Tower monsters have insanely high HP, but can be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">OHKOed</a> by a specific battle item (most of which sort of make sense in a punny way, like throwing a literal plot hole at a best-selling novelist). Then there's the shadow of yourself, which you must defeat <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">by healing yourself every turn</a></span>. After that, you face the Naughty Sorceress's familiar; you must beat it with a familiar of your own of at least 20 pounds, with the five possible enemy familiars each being weak against a specific one of the other four. Finally, there is the battle with the Naughty Sorceress herself, which comes in three parts, one after another without any saves or time to change equipment between stages. The third is either an automatic win or an automatic loss, depending on whether or not you have <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Wand of Nagamar</span> in your inventory. (Earlier, you had to have it equipped, but since it's a fairly weak weapon, this was changed so you can wage battle with a weapon of your choice.)
<ul><li> She can be defeated without the Wand. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">One trick is that while her transformation makes her invincible, it does not cure status effects that already exist. If you can dump enough damage over time effects on her before the end of the second phase.... This used to be fairly simple, but after people started exploiting it, her HP got bumped up drastically.</span> There are several other methods that work as well with varying degrees of success.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WormThatWalks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WormThatWalks">Guy Made Of Bees</a> is similar; he has ridiculous stats and will kill you after the first round unless you <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">break an antique hand mirror</span> to kill him instantly.
</li><li> All of the bosses in the Mer-Kin Temple are a variation of this:
<ul><li> Shub-Jigguwatt has counters for almost any tactic that isn't <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">inflicting purely phyisical damage through normal attacks</a>; in particular, damaging him with anything else will be met with a progressively stronger counterattack. However, he has no counters against non-damaging items, and doesn't prevent you from spamming buffs before the fight starts.
</li><li> Yog-Urt is a lot weaker, but makes up for it with a nasty debuff that locks your skills, inflicts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PercentDamageAttack">Percent Damage Attack</a> on you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageOverTime">each turn</a>, and insta-kills you if the boss takes any damage. The solution is to use healing items to resist until the debuff wears off  and even then, you'll have to stock up on them, because you can only use 1 item of each type.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Dar Sea Monkee</span> is vulnerable to one form of damage out of six  and it changes its weakness each turn. Its introductory message provides the clues to said weaknesses, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">deciphering it is obscenely difficult without a guide</a>. At one point, you have to convert previous weaknesses into numbers, and then put them into an equation.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> has several bosses that have to be defeated by exploiting a gimmick, or at least are much easier to beat by exploiting said gimmick. The best known and most obvious examples are the battles with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarrierChangeBoss">the Daggonnoth and Gelatinnoth Mothers</a>, which both display their current weakness through their skin color.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Wizard101">Wizard101</a></em>, quite a few begin to appear after the first story arc. The most popular techniques are to punish the player with an interrupt casting (cast a spell free from pip cost and out of turn), a super powered spell if the player doesn't play by the hinted (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">or unstated</a>) rules, or make the boss have a shield that reduces any attack on them by 50-90% unless certain conditions are met.
<ul><li> Another puzzle used exclusively by the Jabberwock is that it triples the damage it takes for a single attack after using a super powered meteor spell. This is almost required, since the Jabberwock has more health than the combined health of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DualBoss">two dragons</a> that acts as the final boss for Avalon.
</li><li> The worst of these is possibly <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">teenage Morgan</span>, since even months after the fight has been released, players still haven't solved all of the parts of the puzzle needed to prevent her from interrupt casting the most powerful ice spell in the game.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>, raid bosses and more recent instance bosses can act like this, especially when groups are first encountering them and learning their abilities.
<ul><li> Ignis the Furnace Maker summons invincible golems. However, if they are first drawn through fire until they melt, then dragged into water, they become brittle and a single sufficiently powerful hit will shatter them. They do, however, explode when you do so...
</li><li> Magmaw could theoretically be treated as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamageSpongeBoss">Damage-Sponge Boss</a>, but with proper timing, that's unnecessary. When he slams his head down, you can mount his head and throw chains to pull him onto a spike, exposing his head and leaving him extremely vulnerable for a short time.
</li><li> When fighting Anub'arak in his raid version, the biggest dangers are the abilities involving burrowing. The only way to prevent this is to shoot down innocuous floating ice crystals to spawn icy patches, preventing lesser mobs from burrowing and stopping the boss' spikes from chasing you.
</li><li> In the second phase of the fight against Jin'do the Godbreaker, there are three chains binding Hakkar that must be destroyed, but are protected by a shield. To break the shield, you have to trick the berserkers into slamming onto the chains, and since the slams target players, the players must stand by the shielded chains.
</li><li> Corla, Herald of Twilight in Blackrock Caverns is accompanied by a number of unattackable zealots. Once the fight starts the zealots will start gaining stacks from beams of dark energy emanating from the back of the room. If any zealot reaches 100 stacks then they will transform into an evolved monstrosity that will make things much harder for the tank, with multiple evolved zealots pretty much guaranteeing a wipe. Players can block the beams to prevent the zealots from becoming empowered but if they do so for too long then they too will gain 100 stacks and become hostile monstrosities. The solution is for each player to stand in a beam until they get about 80 stacks, then move out of the beam until their stacks drop, then move back into the beam before the zealot can get 100 stacks on so on. It turned out that this required too much coordination and general awareness for the types of parties that resulted from the game's new Looking For Group feature, resulting in many of them falling apart when they reached Corla.
</li><li> Dark Animus in Throne of Thunder was designed as one. There are 100 units of Anima that start out in small golems, and are transferred to other nearby golems once a golem is killed. When the boss comes out, it absorbs one unit of Anima from every active golem, and once it reaches 100 Anima, quickly wipes the raid. The goal is to delay it from getting to 100 Anima for as long as possible by consolidating the Anima in the largest golems (achieved by killing the smallest golems near them), resulting in the boss taking the longest time to get to full power.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIV">Final Fantasy XIV</a></em>
<ul><li> In one boss battle in the <em>Stormblood</em>, all of your abilities are disabled and you must pass the trial to proceed. Said trial involves avoiding attacks coming at you in different patterns. Get hit twice and you're bound in place until the next part of the trial. It's a total wipe if the entire party fails the trial at once.
</li><li> Another boss from the alliance raids in <em>Stormblood</em> forces all players' HP into the single-digits, then tasks players with standing in number-marked circles to match their HP to a certain value (multiples of 3, square roots, etc.). Failure to match your HP to the required value twice will result in guaranteed death.

At this point in the game you've found only two weapons, the Short Sword and the Red Rust, with the latter being considerably weaker than the former: the intent was to frustrate you to the point of trying everything, realizing the Red Rust can inflict the curse status which reduces Doppleganger to a difficulty appropriate for that point in the game, and learning that weapons have unique properties and that the statistically strongest weapon is not always the best.

<ul><li> Ripper Roo in the first two games spends most of his boss battles immune to direct damage.

To clarify, he spends the battle shooting three different-colored laser shots at you: pink, green, and blue. You have to work out that you have to spin the green shots back at him. Other than the different color, there's absolutely nothing to clue you in that you're supposed to do something with those shots, and even then, because the rule throughout the rest of the game has been that laser shots will kill you, most players would never think to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolationOfCommonSense">spin into them</a>.

<ul><li> The final battle against King K. Rool is a hilarious 5-round boxing match, with a different Kong fighting him each round and a different tactic needed to beat him. Over the course of the battle, you'll end up shooting the spotlights above the arena so they'll fall on him, tricking him into slipping on a giant banana peel, and shrinking down so you can enter a hole in his shoes and beat up his toes.

Such examples include tossing a block at a fragile ceiling to cause a giant block to drop down and crush the demonic cat chasing you, or finding a way of breaking a bridge to dump the pair of gimp-masked fleshy titans into lava pits. The bosses all die in one hit, too, so the battles tend to be either extremely drawn-out or very short.

Klaww in the original game had to be defeated by dodging his thrown rocks and then using Yellow Eco to hurl fireballs into his crotch until he dropped the massive rock he was creating on his own head, and then the process had to be repeated. ALL of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Jak3Wastelander">Jak 3: Wastelander</a></em>'s bosses have some element of this in them: a Precursor mech, for example, is entirely bulletproof but can be downed by dodging multiple energy blasts and the lightsaber it is wielding, waiting for it to create pillars for no real reason, then climbing them to repeatedly shoot a mine cart to fall on its head.

He's invincible (shooting him only shocks him for a short period of time), so you have to bomb the platform he stands on. Later, you have to shoot him twice, then shoot some switches while he's shocked (and can't shoot at you). He still doesn't give up — the Vikings meet him two times more in that level before he's gone.
</li><li> By now, one in fact has to wonder if Mario would even be able to beat Bowser were it not for Bowser's tendency to choose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossArenaIdiocy">terrible arenas</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TacticalSuicideBoss">attack patterns</a>. Consider:
<ul><li> In the original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros">Super Mario Bros.</a></em>, there are two ways to beat Bowser. If you have the Fire Flower, you can just throw fireballs at him until he dies; if you don't, you have to get past him (either jumping over him or running under him) and touch an axe sitting just behind him, which will cause the bridge he's standing on to withdraw and dump him in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaPit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LavaPit">Lava Pit</a>.
</li><li> Defeating Bowser in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioBros3">Super Mario Bros. 3</a></em> requires that Mario simply stay alive as Bowser smashes the arena, until he's destroyed enough of it that he falls through the floor to his demise (though the traditional strategy of hitting him with enough fireballs/hammers still works).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioWorld">Super Mario World</a></em>, Bowser lost to you throwing his own Mechakoopas at him.
<ul><li> This can be Justified, since Bowser loses his patience after a while of Mario surviving.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em> had you throw Bowser into bombs lining the arena. The bombs serve no purpose other than to hurt him, since he can't (or won't) throw you into the bombs himself, and you frankly have to be suicidal to run into them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioSunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a></em> had you use FLUDD'S rocket pack to do ground pounds until the point that the hot tub Bowser is sitting in breaks apart. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">Yes, really.</a> Other bosses in the game qualify, too. For example, King Boo is defeated by fooling him into eating Peppers, which appear when the slot machine lands on three cherries.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a></em>, perhaps in a throwback to <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, had you defeat Bowser by having him smash into structural weak points on the artificial planetoid you're fighting on. This set his tail on fire and caused him to run away from you; you had to run the other way to intercept him, then spin into him before he could turn around to knock him on his back and set him spinning around the planetoid. Spinning into him again would deal damage.
<ul><li> Ditto the final "Story Minigame" of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty">Mario Party</a> 5</em>. Yes, <em>really</em>. And then after that stage, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SequentialBoss">final stage</a> had one of his attacks hitting the residue from another of his attacks to create something that could actually be used against him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMarioGalaxy2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a></em>, you have to use your Ground Pound to launch meteors into Bowser. The catch is that Bowser himself summons the meteors, and they can't be launched into him until he punches the planetoid and knocks them back into the air.
</li><li> Most bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/YoshisIsland">Yoshi's Island</a></em> are like this; Mario can defeat the first two by pelting them with eggs, but others have some sort of trick to them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPrincessPeach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperPrincessPeach">Super Princess Peach</a></em>, defeating the bosses requires using Peach's Vibes in some way, and each is different. Bowser himself is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalExamBoss">Final-Exam Boss</a> where winning requires use of <em>all</em> of them.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">Luigi's Mansion</a></em>, most Portrait Ghosts are impervious to Luigi's flashlight (which is required to stun ghosts so he can use the Poltergust 2000 on them) until he does something to make them vulnerable which is unique to each of them. Sometimes this involves interacting with the Portrait Ghost, and more often than not fulfilling the condition also enables them to attack Luigi.
</li><li> Most bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WarioWorld">Wario World</a></em> are like this too. In most cases, defeating them requires stunning them and then using one of Wario's super-moves, but first you have to figure out <em>how</em> to stun it, which usually takes a different method than with common enemies. (And some can't be stunned at all.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan2">Mega Man 2</a></em> has a shining example of a Puzzle Boss. Wily's Castle, level 4. The boss is a number of laser turrets, who can only be hurt by Crash Bombs, protected by walls that can only be broken by Crash Bombs. Yes, you could bullheadedly blast through all the walls surrounding the turrets, but if you do that, you'll run out of Crash Bombs before reaching the last turret and make the fight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unwinnable">Unwinnable</a>. The solution, of course, is to use Item-1 to float up past the big glaring open areas underneath or above the less-shielded turrets, thereby bypassing the shields. If you do it that way, then you'll kill the last turret with your very <em>last</em> Crash Bomb, so don't screw up.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan8">Mega Man 8</a></em>, the first Wily Boss is dangling from the ceiling, far from the reach of any conventional weapon except Astro Crash. Which you only have four/five uses of, and it'll just leave scratch marks on the boss. So what do you do? Use that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a> weapon, the Mega Ball. If you kick it upwards at the right spots, it'll hit the boss.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManAndBass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManAndBass">Mega Man &amp; Bass</a></em>, it at first seems like Burner Man can't be damaged much by any weapon, including his weakness, the Ice Wall. However, if you push the Ice Wall <em>into</em> him, you'll notice that he'll be pushed by the Wall along the ground... and if he ends up being pushed into one of the spiked pits on either side of the arena by it, he's dealt massive damage.
<ul><li> There's also the first castle boss, whose weak spot is revealed when you stand on the platform.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManDrWilysRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManDrWilysRevenge">Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge</a></em> (don't remember it? It was on the Game Boy) gives you a weapon near the end of the game called the Mirror Buster, which does no damage on its own but can reflect projectiles back at enemies. Guess what the only way to damage the final form of the final boss is. Go on, guess.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX6">Mega Man X6</a></em>, Gate can only be harmed by the fragments of his own energy spheres; you must destroy them at the appropriate time so that he is hit. As a side note, the fragments also destroy some of your platforms and there is a bottomless pit (instant death) at the bottom of the room (luckily your character can climb the walls). It's a bit difficult, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and makes the requisite battle against a weak and deranged <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HijackedByGanon">Sigma</a> afterwards rather anticlimactic.</span> A charged Yanmar Option allows X to stay off to one side and let the bugs kill the balls of death for him, so it's mostly down to holding out against the stream of attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Metroid</a></em>:

<ul><li> Arachnus. While he's a pushover of a fight, it's up to the player to figure out that you can only damage him with the Morph Ball Bombs. The game gives a vague clue to it due to the Arachnus curling up and bouncing around like a Morph Ball.
</li><li> The only way to damage the Metroid Queen's hide is with missiles, and she takes a really long time to kill, not only because it takes a lot of shots but because she doesn't give Samus many openings to shoot. However, if you can hit her while her neck is extending enough times she might leave her mouth open long enough for Samus to morph ball in and do some internal damage. Even then the damage from bombs will be negligible unless Samus has enough energy to make it to the queen's stomach.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMetroid">Super Metroid</a></em>:
<ul><li> Crocomire forces you to keep shooting at its mouth when it's open in order to force it back onto some crumbling blocks and send it falling into the lava. Particularly nefarious because there's no boss life meter, so it's hard to tell you're not really doing any damage, and because Crocomire keeps advancing towards you, essentially healing itself. Apparently, with some creative jumping, you can actually end up <em>behind</em> Crocomire, causing it to back itself up all the way to its death. Inversely, don't use Power Bombs against Crocomire. Crocomire <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">does not like Power Bombs.</a>
</li><li> From the same game, Draygon is easily beaten by breaking one of the weapon turrets, letting Draygon grab you, and then shooting your grappling beam into the broken turret. There's a massive electrical discharge that hurts you, but fries Draygon a lot quicker.

<ul><li> Technically, a mech walker battle had an explosive canister in the center that could be shot to damage anyone in its vicinity, but it rarely proved useful. You were allowed to just whale on the enemy. Since the lock-on system loves to target anything and everything, it was more likely that you would hurt yourself with said canister. Not to mention that you pass through the middle a lot trying to get close to your opponent so that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> isn't as hard to dodge.
</li><li> All bosses of have weak points except for Eggman/Tails and Rouge/Knuckles. For Sonic and Shadow, it's their backs. For the walkers, it's their cockpits. Some have trickier ones, like jumping up platforms to strike the weak spot on the Egg Golem's head, or hitting an hourglass so that light fills a pyramid to cause King Boom Boo (a giant ghost who breathes fire) to turn into a shadow on the ground... and then, of course, you have to chase said shadow and then <em>dig into him</em>. Then, after you dig him out of the ground, you have to <em>chase him again</em> and then finally punch him. But then of course, there's the two incarnations of the final boss: You have to grind the tubes hanging from his mouth to strike the weakspot on his back, and then later you have to homing attack eggs just to reach it the final time. Then, when he becomes bigger and badder (as in he <em>melds himself into a space station that is quickly falling towards Earth</em>), his weakspot actually <em>changes places as you fight him</em>.

</li><li> For that matter, the Dark Gaia Phoenix required you to throw barrels of water at it, or trick it into flying into said barrels of water, in order to render it vulnerable. The Dark Moray had a similar mechanic involving freezing it with canisters of cold gas before being able to attack its weak point safely.
</li></ul></li><li> Several in some of the newer 2D games. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance2">Sonic Advance 2</a></em>'s Super Sonic fight entailed smacking missiles back into Eggman. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance3">Sonic Advance 3</a></em> has a boss which can be damaged by the platforms that fall as you jump off them as everything scrolls up, and also one where you hit balls to make them deadly to Eggman (the balls bounce around the room). In <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRush">Rush</a> </em>, there is a scarab beetle boss in which you have to smack the ball, and make it hit the back of Eggman. And in <em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRushAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicRushAdventure">Rush Adventure</a> </em>, there's a boss in which you must smack a pendulum based system with enough force to hit the weak point at the top.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicMania">Sonic Mania</a></em> features one of the most literal examples of this trope in the series: the boss fight of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog2">Chemical Plant Zone</a> Act 2 involves <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> challenging Eggman to a round of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrRobotniksMeanBeanMachine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DrRobotniksMeanBeanMachine">Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine</a></em>.</span>

</li><li> All the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vessel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Vessel">Vessel</a></em> are puzzle bosses. Fitting, considering the game is a puzzle-based platformer. The first boss in the factory is made of lava, which needs a plumbing change to defeat. The generator at the orchard requires the player to exploit what happens when blue and red goo mix. The final boss is remotely controlled and needs the player to use their knowledge of how the Flouros in the control areas react to the light from the glow goo to mess with the boss's controls.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe">Viewtiful Joe</a></em> plays this pretty straight in that all bosses and even many normal enemies will take trifling damage unless you work out how to stun them first. You can often still win by pounding away with your best attacks, but it will take about ten times as long.
<ul><li> One of the best examples is the first boss, a giant bat who will evade all direct attacks by splitting into a cloud of normal bats. You <em>can</em> whittle him down by attacking said normal bats, but it'll take an agonizingly long time. You have to knock a stalactite into him to bring him down to earth before attacking to do any decent damage.

The Crown rooms were the last vestiges of the original plan to have more combination problems (with both physical and puzzle elements; mostly ditched after playtesting showed that if people failed the physical part, they'd all-too-often think it was because they got the puzzle wrong), but Penitentiary  the Crown room and most of the rest of that planet  is clearly the most heavily puzzle-based.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2">Portal 2</a></em>'s final boss works similarly, involving redirecting thrown bombs to hit the boss's weak point, then attaching a part to the boss to corrupt it.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoTrigger">Chrono Trigger</a></em>, attacking Ozzie directly results in a counterattack against your entire party.

Or, if the player doesn't get the hint after a while, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiFrustrationFeatures">the switch will eventually become the only thing the player can target</a>.

Down he goes.
</li><li> Nizbel and Nizbel II have obscenely high defense until they are hit by Lightning-based attacks.
<ul><li> Same thing works on all dinos. What makes Nizbel special is that he will surprise you by "discharging electric energy" and zapping your entire team to get rid of the "shocked" status. So the real trick of the battle comes down to A: shocking him, and B: keeping the party prepared for his retaliatory shock.
</li><li> Even a fair number of regular enemies get this treatment. Once you get magic, about half the enemies in the game will be heavily resistant to physical attacks, magical attacks, or magic apart from one element.
</li><li> A similar tactic is required when fighting the optional boss Rentinite. Only this time, it's water-based attacks. Any other damage to it raises its defenses to nigh invulnerability.

Attacking the wrong one gets you a counterattack as well, and they get shuffled around repeatedly.</a> Going into the fight with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">fire-absorbing armor</a> makes the boss pathetic, though.

This proves to be quite difficult, because the boss's spells mess with the order, so you have to either hope that the boss uses elements that complement the sequence, or have characters fast enough to complete the sequence without being interrupted.</span>
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChronoCross">Chrono Cross</a></em> also features the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> Criosphinx. To defeat him, you have to respond to his riddles with an Element of the proper color. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The order of the colors to answer his riddles is the same order that is needed to activate the Chrono Cross to defeat the last boss.

</li><li> But it should be noted that simply casting the right spells isn't enough. You have to cause enough damage to kill him while playing his game. Otherwise, he runs at the end of the puzzle. If you cast the wrong spell, however, he will proceed to nuke you with high level earth spells until you are dead, which will happen <em>very</em> fast if you don't have the earth absorbing armor on.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The Fat Pharmacist in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CitizensOfEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CitizensOfEarth"> Citizens of Earth</a></em>. Before even fighting him, you need to figure out that you need to get the Big Bertha donut from the bakery in your hometown. Then, you must return to him with the donut, and he will attack you. But if you beat him, he'll just complain about you hurting him and no progress will be made. Instead, you must use the "run away" command to make him chase you and lose weight. Keep running away and he'll shrink back to normal size and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatMeansFriendship">join you</a>.
</li><li> The first boss, Raditz, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a>: Legend of the Super Saiyan</em> for the Super Famicom. He is immune to damage due to having a much higher power level than Goku and Piccolo. Since the game follows the manga story, in order to defeat Raditz, you have to use the Gohan card received from Mr. Popo, which summons Gohan to weaken him. This opens up another command option to allow Goku to grab hold of Raditz from behind. Finally, you allow Piccolo to use his Special Beam Cannon to take them both down.
</li><li> The first form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Rhapthorne</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em> makes the party members all use an item in their inventories to "pray" to the Goddess Scepter. If all four of them do it, a spirit is summoned. The party has to do this for seven turns before they move on to fight Rhapthorne for real.
</li><li> Giygas, the final boss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Earthbound">Earthbound</a></em> (<em>Mother 2</em>), ends as a Puzzle Boss. His initial form must be attacked and weakened like any other boss, but in his final form, the numbers that show up on the screen when you attack him directly are a lie  to ultimately defeat him, you must <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">repeatedly use the previously nigh-useless Pray command</span>, which now does massive, genuine damage to the boss.
<ul><li> Similarly, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother1">Mother 1</a></em>, the final boss, Gieuge, can only be defeated by using <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the now-existent Sing command</span>. Again, you can attack him, and numbers will show up, claiming that you're dealing damage, but the game is lying to you; Gieuge is completely immune to your attacks, so you have to make him not want to fight you anymore in order to win.
</li><li> In the fangame <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CognitiveDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CognitiveDissonance">Cognitive Dissonance</a></em>, there are four ways to win the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> fight with Giygas, each yielding a different ending  use Alinvar's PK Harmony to temporarily restore his sanity, use Niiue's Nightmare Empower to pull Gieuge out and weaken Giygas's defense enough for conventional attacks to fend him off (leading to an extra chapter after the end of the fight), use Niiue's Song to submerge into Giygas's psyche and fight his core, or use the ballpeen hammer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorPiercingAttack">ignore Giygas's defense</a> and beat him down. If you lose to Giygas, you get a separate ending, as your objective in the fight is to buy enough time for Buzz Buzz to escape to the past and kickstart the plot of <em>EarthBound</em>.
</li><li> And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em>, you can only defeat the final boss (the Masked Man <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">aka Claus</span>) by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">not attacking him</span>. A lot. At first <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lucas just can't attack, due to a sort of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstySurvivingTwin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstySurvivingTwin">Angsty Surviving Twin</a> thing</span>, but after that, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">if you do attack, Hinawa's ghost explicitly says "Lucas, you stop fighting first."</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mother3">Mother 3</a></em> also has the Pig King Statue, a ludicrously powerful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> who also has an HP count of <em>99,999,999</em> (that's one HP short of <em>one-hundred million</em>, folks!) in a game where dealing 200 damage with a physical attack is doing really well for yourself.

The Statue is the only boss in the entire game vulnerable to those moves.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EpicBattleFantasy">Epic Battle Fantasy</a> 4</em> has Rafflesia, to a certain extent. While the previous bosses had summoned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mook">mooks</a> to back them up, they only did so once every few rounds at worst, making them easy to dispatch. Rafflesia summons one <em>every round</em>, and when it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a>, it starts summoning <strong>two</strong> per round, leading to an unprepared player getting quickly overwhelmed. The solution? Use nothing but Ice attacks  one of the mooks Rafflesia summons absorbs ice, while the other varieties are all weak to it. The one that absorbs Ice is by far the least threatening, and one of its attacks is Cloudburst, which is basically a total <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneAttack">That One Attack</a>  it does no damage, but makes everything on the field take heavy damage from Ice attacks. Including Rafflesia, who was already weak to Ice. Eventually, Rafflesia's field will be full of mooks that are actually helping <em>you</em> out more than Rafflesia, and because of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArbitraryHeadcountLimit">Arbitrary Headcount Limit</a>, it won't be able to summon anything that poses a threat.
</li><li> The beholder at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EyeOfTheBeholder">Eye of the Beholder</a></em> was supposed to be defeated by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">using a special wand to push it onto a trap</span>. Regular combat would kill it, but the beholder has several save-or-die effects that made it hard to do this before your whole party was gone.
</li><li> Quite some Bosses (and even a couple of common enemies) from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy">Final Fantasy</a></em> series are puzzle bosses.
<ul><li> A common enemy reappearing in various games is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyBattle">magical pot</a>. It talks and tells you to give him an elixir. Otherwise, it will either be simply undefeatable or it will knock you out in no time, if you try just to kill him. (Though, because he tells you how to beat him, you may argue how much of a puzzle it is.) In X, you can grab items from it by striking the correct eye (which is randomized), and in XII, you might very well not realize it's there in the dark levels until you piss it off and it sends a Flare (or something even stronger) at you — which isn't helped by all the undead.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII">Final Fantasy III</a></em> there are two enemies, which are either hard or undefeatable. Garuda can be defeated almost only by Dragoons — though there are hints by townspeople before fighting him. The final boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cloud of Darkness</span>, can only be harmed after defeating her four guardians.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIV">Final Fantasy IV</a></em> features several, most notably Asura and Bahamut. Both are very hard — Asura because she keeps healing herself, and Bahamut because his attacks are very powerful. However, both can be easily defeated by casting Wall, thus causing their moves to reflect onto the opposite side... At least, that's how it used to be. In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">DS version</a>, while Reflect is still required for Asura, Bahamut's Megaflare will ignore Reflect and leave you in a world of hurt, meaning that your entire strategy is going to need an overhaul. Because of this, the book describing him in the Eidolon's Library is changed to match, this time suggesting that no warrior could defeat him, except possibly one capable of "rising to the heavens to deliver the finishing blow". Hey! Guess who one of the final party members is? A dragoon knight that can jump really high!
<ul><li> Dark Knight Cecil is most easily defeated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheatheYourSword">not attacking</a>.
</li><li> Calcobrena takes the form of six dolls, two sets of three. Defeat all of one set, and the dolls will combine into a giant, monstrous, and quite powerful enemy for a while, then turn back into the six dolls. If you don't feel like trying to wear down the big Calcobrena, you have to take out the last Cal and the last Brena in a fairly short interval without giving them a chance to become Calcobrena. It doesn't help that when you have one or the other down to one, they love to use Self-Destruct to suicide on you and give the others an excuse to turn into Calcobrena.
</li><li> There is also Dr. Lugae who, in the DS version, releases Reversal Gas at random intervals. Reversal Gas causes healing items to hurt and anything which causes damage to heal. A second application returns things to normal. A quick way to beat him involves <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie">two Elixirs when under Reversal Gas</a>. Otherwise, it is a very hard fight.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV">Final Fantasy V</a></em> features a couple of puzzle enemies that can only be attacked in a certain state or such. Most notably is Gogo the mimic, who responds to regular attacks and spells with a powerful counterattack and the Flare spell, respectively. The solution is to simply wait, and he will eventually <em>congratulate you for mimicking his doing nothing</em> and surrender. Because he is at the end of a bonus dungeon with an instant-death time limit, the player is expected to be frantically throwing attacks at him in order to beat him and escape. Sitting around doing nothing with a clearly visible countdown timer is very counter-intuitive to most players.
<ul><li> FFV also has Omega, a notorious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> who'll wipe the walls with you no matter what level you're at, UNLESS you know <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">the trick to beating him</a>, which makes him almost pathetically easy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em> has some enemies that can be killed by draining all of their MP, like the Atma Weapon, energy given form with a ridiculously large amount of HP.
<ul><li> This is a good strategy for beating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> at the top of the Fanatics' Tower if you do not have Life 3, due to the boss using Ultima when he is low on HP, usually killing your party. This strategy takes absolutely FOREVER though, and should be combined with Berserk to make sure he doesn't attack much.
</li><li> One bonus boss, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Skull Dragon in the Dragon's Den</span>, <em>must</em> be defeated this way, or else he just regenerates.
</li><li> A lot of the Dragon's Den bosses are puzzle bosses. The Red Dragon can't be killed, only survived against until he burns out all his life. Storm Dragon becomes nigh-unhittable, so bring characters with abilities that ignore evasion. And so on.
</li><li> The first boss, Whelk, is a puzzle boss. However, not only is the trick easy to figure out, it is flat out given to you: "Right. So whatever you do... don't attack the shell!" Of course, you can ignore this and drain all of the shell's HP (with Fire Beam and Tek Missile; it doesn't absorb these) for an Elixir, but since Whelk will counterattack each blow you make, you need to heal every other turn. It's not worth it though, because you can find Elixirs <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in nearly every clock in the game.</span>
</li><li> Wrexsoul is another puzzle boss, and the game deliberately gives you a clue. At the beginning of the fight, he says "I'm gonna possess your body!" and vanishes, leaving behind two weak enemies that you can't get rid of because they endlessly resurrect themselves whenever they die. To make Wrexsoul appear again so you can damage him, you have to kill your own party members, one by one, until you've killed the one that Wrexsoul was hiding in. (Incidentally, the two weak enemies can't revive if you cast X-Zone/Banish and kill them both. This ends the fight, but you don't get Wrexsoul's item drop.)
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em> has two super bosses that punish you for trying to fight them normally. Emerald WEAPON has an attack that deals 1111 damage times the number of materia a party member has equipped; use 9 materia or more and it's instant death. Using less materia will reduce the damage done from the attack, but now you have to learn to tackle the boss with reduced fighting capabilities. Ruby WEAPON starts the battle by removing 2 of your party members from the battlefield (with no way to get them back) and then summons a pair of tentacles for a pincer attack. You can counter this by starting the fight with 2 of your allies already dead so that the boss summons the tentacles, then you can revive your allies and fight as normal.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVIII">Final Fantasy VIII</a></em> features many bosses with special attack points or such which must be destroyed first. For example, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the aliens</span> on board Ragnarok come in four colors and must be defeated in order of color or they'll regenerate in no time.
<ul><li> There is also a pair of optional bosses who can rapidly recover from any attack due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElementalRockPaperScissors">the power of earth</a>. Casting "Float" on them prevents them from healing themselves. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1yl2p');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1yl2p" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1yl2p');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Those familiar with classical mythology — specifically, Hercules's fight with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antaeus">Antaeus<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> — should easily figure this out on their own.</span>
</li><li> If you try to fight Diabolos like you've been handling the rest of the game, he's a rather nasty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WakeUpCallBoss">Wake-Up Call Boss</a>. However, if you draw/cast his own gravity spells on him, you cut down his massive HP by multiple increments of halves, and he <em>rewards you</em> for doing this by casting Curaga on the one who used Gravity on him. This is also a way of showing how massively important the draw system can be.
</li></ul></li><li> Ozma in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIX">Final Fantasy IX</a></em> is extremely difficult if fought head-on, due to using many powerful spells (one of which, Doomsday, heals it in addition to damaging your party), being out of reach of melee attacks, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialBrilliance">good AI that prevents it from using spells that would be useless</a><span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25rkb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25rkb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25rkb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Ozma won't use an elemental spell if everyone absorbs that element (though immunity to that element doesn't count}) and won't use a status-inflicting spell if everyone is immune to that status.</span>, and getting a free turn whenever one of your characters acts. But there are various things you can do to make it easier. Completing a certain sidequest will make Ozma vulnerable to melee attacks and Shadow damage (the latter causing it to be damaged whenever it uses Doomsday, rather than healed). Inputting commands for your characters only while Ozma is casting a spell will stop it getting free turns. Choosing your party's equipment and abilities carefully will cause Ozma to use its less dangerous spells, reducing the likelihood of it using its more dangerous ones.
</li><li> The Seymour fights, particularly Natus and Flux, in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX">Final Fantasy X</a></em> are basically puzzle bosses because of his set attack pattern — there are specific counters to all of his attacks. Sure, you could try to strong-arm it, but that would require overleveling compared to the nearby monsters.
<ul><li> Yunalesca requires the player to keep the "Zombie" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">debuff</a> in order to survive her Megadeath attack. However, this prevents you from being able to heal. Deathproof and Zombieproof is a viable, though expensive alternative.
</li><li> Defender-X, the mech encountered at the base of Mount Gagazet. It has an array of very, very powerful attacks that can leave a player who hacks-and-slashes their way through tearing their hair out (especially since its HP is high and it is Armored, meaning it takes very little damage and thus you will have to survive a number of these attacks)... but there's a way to beat it very easily, though it's extremely counterintuitive. Have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Tidus</a> use his Provoke move, which will goad the monster into targeting only him — sounds incredibly stupid, given Tidus's low general survivability (seriously, why didn't they give that move to Auron instead?), but the catch is that once Provoked, the monster will <em>also</em> only use the move that deals percentage-based damage. That move is devastating combined with his other attacks, but if it's the only thing he uses, it means that he is actually incapable of killing even one party member, let alone the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TotalPartyKill">total party kills</a> he is otherwise quite proficient at, turning the entire fight into a cakewalk.
</li><li> Also, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostFinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostFinalBoss">Post-Final Boss</a> of <em>X</em>, Yu Yevon. He regenerates health if attacked but he only uses percentage based attacks that also hurt him until his HP gets low. You can hit him with attacks more damaging than he can heal, or hit the two pylons in the battle as well (which revive automatically) until Yevon's Health starts getting low from his own attacks. Or cast Zombie on him and let him take himself out with his healing.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII">Final Fantasy XIII</a></em> features the battles with each character's Eidolon. You're supposed to fill a gauge above the Eidolon's head, then push square to end the battle. Theoretically, you could just keep hitting the thing until the gauge is full. However, these are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeLimitBoss">timed battles</a>, and mashing attack just isn't very efficient. Instead, you can use a Librascope item or the Libra technique to learn the Eidolon's weakness, which are generally kind of counterintuitive. For example, when fighting the Shiva sisters, you only have one party member, Snow. Snow can do some damage on his own, but he won't be able to stagger the enemy by himself. You are <em>supposed</em> to switch to the Sentinel role, which specializes in defense. Blocking the sisters' attacks fills the gauge more efficiently than attacking. Similarly, you're supposed to heal wounds during the Odin fight instead of attacking.
<ul><li> The Eidolon battles are intended to teach the characters a lesson. Snow's strategies are of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a> variety, with little concern for anyone else, and the Shiva sisters are trying to show him that just attacking isn't helping anyone. Lightning was about to abandon Hope, who was slowing her down, and Odin is trying to show her that only by helping others can she continue her journey. It's not always <em>obvious</em>, mind you, but it's an interesting take on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration">Gameplay and Story Integration</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2">Final Fantasy XIII-2</a></em> has most of the DLC bosses, but Snow takes the cake.

However, it has a nasty habit of regenerating ungodly amounts of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints">Hit Points</a> every turn. The solution? Scale the wall outside the entrance to get the Dancing Idol, which you can then use on the odd altar-slash-table things at the entrance, then go through the <em>real</em> dungeon (as opposed to the comparatively short puzzle involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLostWoods">identical rooms</a> with a plant that you must cast <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenThumb">Growth</a> on to find the right direction to move) and use your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlowYouAway">Gale Psynergy</a> to move plants off of holes in the ground to send beams of light down onto crystals in the Serpent's chamber. Each beam of light reduces its regenerative power one-third of its strength, with all four being needed to render the regeneration almost completely useless at 30HP per turn, as opposed to the 2430 per turn that it starts with — nearly seventy percent of its maximum health. Considering how weak your party is likely to be by that point in the game without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a>, you'll need to have more than just one or two lights on or it'll be practically invincible anyway. Even with all four lights, it's still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">annoying as hell</a>, though thankfully having all four lights on removes one of its turns, reducing it to two actions per round as opposed to three.

While he can be defeated through brute force as normal, he will sometimes use Ancient Sign to take control of one of your party members so that they fight against you. Depending on who he possesses, the controlled ally could be disastrous if they know powerful healing abilities or other abilities to buff themselves and the boss with, or waste rare items like the full restore Potion. Even if you do knock them out, not only you have to revive the person you put down, but the boss will just take control of someone else. If you have any Djinn on standby, the possessed ally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">will summon them against your party</a>. The puzzle here is to try and get the boss to take control of a party member that is either very weak or does not have many strong items or abilities so that the fight does not get any harder.
</li><li> <em>Dark Dawn</em>'s version of the Dullahan is arguably a version of this as well. While he's even <em>harder</em> than his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">That One Boss</a> incarnation in the previous games and truly deserves the title of hardest damn enemy in the game to kill, there is a trick that reduces his difficulty from "nearly unbeatable" to "difficult". Dullahan has a distinct pattern to which moves he uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">(not that you'd EVER figure it out without a frigging walkthrough or hundreds of tries)</a>, that allows you to predict when his stupidly lethal Djinn Storm is coming to wreck your strategy and leave your characters dealing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScratchDamage">Scratch Damage</a> for god knows how long while the Dullahan regens most of his health back. Setting things up properly can allow you to use the Chasm Djinn to reduce his deadly Charon Summon's damage to less than 20 (and hopefully avoid the instant-death chance the summon has) followed by deploying either Doldrum or Ivy to stop Dullahan from using one of his three moves for the turn; if you exploited the pattern perfectly, you can lock Dullahan out of his Djinn Storm and typically weather all of his other attacks unless you're unlucky enough to be hit by his instant-death moves. Without Djinn Storm, Dullahan is much, <em><strong>much</strong></em> easier to defeat.

By deciphering the clues from the previous part of the quest, the player can use the wands in a certain order on the golem, making it crumble away without ever attacking. If the golem ever attacks, it's because you failed the puzzle — it remains passive as long as the player is making the correct choices, and actually recites a story to describe the elements as each wand is used.

First, there are little mini-bosses called Clay Idols that can't be damaged in any way, save for one otherwise-useless spell. Thankfully, you can just run past them rather than engage them. Then there's Gnome itself, which splits into four bodies when anyone gets too close to it, making it immune to every attack in your arsenal and going ballistic on your team. The trick is to keep away from him, avoiding the usual strategy of having the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyGlacier">Mighty Glacier</a> Cless run up to the boss and whaling away at it. Either just sit back and let the casters destroy Gnome with their spells, or help them out with the long-range Demon Fang.

The trick to the fight is realizing that Earth Shaker is a <em>counterattack</em>. If you don't attack a Worm, it will only use very weak, single-target moves. You're supposed to focus down the Abyss Worms one-by-one rather than attack them all at once, that way you only have to deal with one Earth Shaker at a time.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale">Undertale</a></em>, all fights are technically puzzle fights if you choose to spare your opponents - the puzzle being finding a series of ACT commands that inspires your opponent to back down from the fight. Sparing <em>bosses</em> requires the player either to use the commands at their disposal in a way they never have before (Ex. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">For Toriel, you <em>must</em> repeatedly spare her; no other command advances the fight</span>) and/or introduces a totally novel play mechanic (ex.

The Megasparkle Goomba is comprised of numerous smaller Goombas and can be blown apart with the Fan; Tower Power Pokey's individual segments can be knocked away with the Baseball Bat (the boss arena kind of looks like a baseball stadium, providing a hint to this); your multi-hit stickers don't lose their multi-hit abilities in the later battles with Kamek where he turns everything into Sandals; Gooper Blooper's poison attack can be deflected back at him with the Sponge; the Big Cheep Cheep has to be reeled in with the Giant Fishhook (this one's absolutely necessary); Bowser Jr. in his second boss battle carries Bob-ombs over his head which can be knocked down into him with Hurlhammers; Big Boo <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LuigisMansion">can be vacuumed up</a>; Mizzter Blizzard is extremely weak to fire and healed by ice; Bowser Jr. in his final battle has a dome shield that reduces almost all damage, but can be destroyed by batting his own missiles back at it with a Tail; Bowser's first form summons enemies from a hole in the wall that can be patched up with Tape; Bowser's second form uses a Whomp that can be sliced apart with Scissors; Bowser's third form attacks with Podoboos that can be frozen with Shaved Ice; Bowser's fourth form attacks with a Chain Chomp that can be batted back at him with the Tail; and Bowser's final form is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerable">Nigh-Invulnerable</a> until plot-related stuff happens.

When Larry uses the smoke of the train the battle takes place on, sticking a cork in the smokestack stops him, Lemmy's giant spiked ball can be popped with an Ice Pick after he is distracted with the Disco Ball and the battle screen can be cleaned up by the Washing Machine when Roy decides to throw paint everywhere. Outside the Thing Weakness system, Petea Piranha can counter jump attacks if standing and knocking him over makes him vulnerable if a certain attack is blocked and Bowser will regenerate health if his attacks are not blocked, which get more dangerous the more he was hit in one turn (and you can only block 11 attacks).

<ul><li> To elaborate, you have to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlienInvasion">General Shroob</a>, who commands Shroob grunts to attack you (without ever attacking on his own). Occasionally, he will call in a three-Shroob squad to carry a giant bomb into the arena, after which he scurries off the screen, unable to be targeted. In order to bring him out again, the player must eliminate the Shroob farthest to the back, causing the other two to lose their balance and drop the bomb<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note31zgn');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note31zgn" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note31zgn');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Most players would probably use power-ups like Trampolines or Copy Flowers in order to kill them all at once, but this will cause the bomb to roll towards <em>you</em> instead</span>, sending it rolling off the screen and launching the General back onto the stage in the ensuing detonation. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComputerIsACheatingBastard">he doesn't take any damage (at least, there is no indication) from the explosion, while Mario and Luigi get hit so hard they fly to the top screen and back down, taking quite a number out of their health.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> Another Partners In Time example: Sunnycide has (probably) the highest defense yet in the game, until you free the Yoshis to make them push a boulder and knock him over.
<ul><li> And the Swiggler from the Vim Factory. If you attack the doctor shroobs while they have mushrooms out, they would drop them into the Swiggler's drink and heal it when it gets its turn. Unless they were grey mushrooms, in which case they made it ill.
</li></ul></li><li> Most Mario hacks generally stick to the regular bosses. But the main feature of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BrutalMario">Brutal Mario</a></em> is facing off against bosses from a host of different games, many of them Puzzle Bosses.

The first is Alpha Kretin, who you have to defeat by turning all the segments of him blue (and they can only be attacked by the brother whose colour matches said segment) and then defeating in his next form. Dark Star is invincible, but has its defense lowered after you damage its two flunkies and then hammer them back at it. Dark Bowser/Fawful Bug requires you to hurt Dark Bowser (1000 HP), then hit his stomach when he becomes giant, then eat the Dark Fawful Bug/Star Core, then as Mario and Luigi kill the legs and glasses, then attack the core of that. Oh, and you get to finish off Dark Bowser with five more massive punches to the face after all this.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioAndLuigi">Mario &amp; Luigi</a> series in general has quite a few Puzzle Bosses. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> of each game tends to have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CognizantLimbs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CognizantLimbs">Cognizant Limbs</a> which need to be attacked in a certain order.
<ul><li> Heck, even the rank-and-file Mooks have puzzle elements to them. Sure, you could just attack them, and they attack you back. But almost every enemy attack can be blocked or dodged in some way, many even letting you counterattack!
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForeverHome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ForeverHome">Forever Home</a></em> gives many bosses unusual gimmicks, like how the Chaw has a gender-specific counterattack and how the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a> can be weakened by killing his orbs.

Then, the player has to use a fully charged Wave Cannon attack to make the Force explode, resulting in a massive wave of energy that <em>still</em> doesn't kill the boss, but <em>does</em> irrepairably damage the Wave Cannon.

</li><li> The "auto-hit" attack could be dodged by holding R, steering all the way to the right, and spamming the brakes (which, for some reason, apply a backward force on the Arwing even if it's supposedly not moving forward).

You can face him straight up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneBoss">probably the toughest boss battle in the entire game</a>, while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> occasionally appear to harass your wingmen (which, unlike in most boss fights, actually <em>do</em> increase your score a little, but not enough to be worthwhile)... or you can shoot the eight switches to unlock the switcher box, then shoot that twice to open it up and switch the track, sending the entire train <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp">careening into the weapons factory</a> and getting you a total of 51 points.

<ul><li> Triti from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TraumaCenter">Trauma Center</a></em> starts out as a huge mass of triangles, held in place by thorns. Trying to remove one section at a time will send legions of them out into the organ. The key is to take the thorns out in certain patterns, to prevent any respawning that you don't want. Specifically, when you remove a triangle, if there are two thorns next to each other and on the edge of the set of triangles, a triangle will spawn there if there is room to respawn.

However, in the event that a red and a blue come in contact, they become a tumor and you can drain them. Rather simple, right up until every time after the first you come into contact with it when there's more than one of each color. At that point, two of the same color meeting will create another tumor as well as make the patient's vitals drop. In addition, even once a red and blue one meet, a third of either color getting involved will break them up before you can drain them. Solution? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">They can't cross Antibiotic Gel walls.</span> Also, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Deftera will not even attempt to meet with another Deftera body if they're not at the same strength, though they will still interrupt a pair.</span>

<ul><li> All of the bosses in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon">Splatoon</a></em> have to this to some extent. For Octostomp, the player needs to wait until it tries to slam itself on the player than ride up to it's back using ink. For Octonozzle, the player need to shoot its tentacle stumps on it's body. For Octowhirl, players need to have it roll over enough of the player's ink to slow it to a stop.

However the most confusing of these might be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.

To damage him you need to hit his mecha's fists back at him. And during later stages of the fight he changes the way to hurt him, which you have to repel a gigantic missile three times consecutively, and if you miss it once you have to start the repulsion again. Even with knowing this, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarathonBoss">won't go down easily</a>. Only when you break the force field completely and attacking the pilot point blank will the fight be over.
</li><li> Several bosses in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SyphonFilter">Syphon Filter</a></em> series, but most notably the final battle with Chance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole">The Mole</a>, in <em>Syphon Filter 2</em>. He wears full body armor that not only makes him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToBullets">Immune to Bullets</a>, but to the shrapnel and shockwave of <em>grenade impact explosions</em> as well (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">No One Could Survive That!</a> in real life, even with a heavy-duty anti-bomb suit). And it doesn't hinder his movement, either. The only way to defeat him is to procure the UAS-12 auto-shotgun from the helicopter, and use its blast to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlownAcrossTheRoom">push him backward</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelicopterBlender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HelicopterBlender">into the spinning tail rotor</a>, which his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmorIsUseless">armor is useless</a> against, resulting in a spray of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureBlood">High-Pressure Blood</a>, although no severed limbs.

Actually defeating Baldus is not the trick; it's getting him to join you — and that's easy enough as long as you bother to follow Nessiah's instructions to the letter. There are plenty of cases of players ignoring Nessiah and accidentally killing Baldus, though.
<ul><li> The final stage of the C route gives the boss a Protect lock — these prevent Morale from dropping below 1, and effectively confer invincibility — which cannot be broken except by moving a specific party member to a specific location during a specific stage of the fight in order to destroy the boss's power source.

Instead of going straight for Mid-Boss when the battle starts, what you should be focusing on is on the three Geo Symbols on the field (Laharl can take them out with one special move) as the two enemies who are affected by those symbols not only get to attack twice, but also do over 100 HP of damage to your party (and you'll be not very likely to have over 100 HP in one of your party members unless you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grind</a>, have the right equipment, or are playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>).

He can only be hurt every 4th turn in <em>Gaiden</em> or every 4th attack in <em>Shadows of Valentia</em>. You do get a slight hint in the Sage's Hamlet, but it is up to the player to interpret what the hint means and thus how to damage him.

Late in the first season, our heroes find themselves trapped in a magical maze. The "always go left" track doesn't work, if they try to cut the walls with their swords, they just grow back together, and if Sakura tries to fly above the walls, they just get infinitely higher. Just when it looks like all is lost, supporting character Mizaki-sensei appears, carrying a magical bell... which she proceeds to use as a hammer and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">bashes the walls down</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DungeonBypass">one after the other, in a straight line to the edge of the maze</a>.

Golems in some older editions are a good example — physically powerful and immune to virtually all spells (with a very few specific exceptions for each type) and all but powerful magical weapons, a golem that hits a poorly prepared party with no ready way to retreat can easily wipe it out. However, golems are <em>also</em> virtually mindless, and if encountered alone, almost always simply follow a set of "pre-programmed" instructions, which may allow the same player characters that could never defeat them in a stand-up fight to simply avoid one by figuring out in time just what their standing orders are.

The first time, Mr. Incredible climbs inside the Omnidroid, and in its attempts to reach him, the robot punctures itself several times until it hits its power core and deactivates. In the rematch, the Incredibles are able to claim the Omnidroid's remote control, using it to launch a detached claw through the power core.

<ul><li> In the very first Part, each battle with Dio once he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">puts on the Stone Mask</span> involves this in some way. In the first confrontation, Jonathan discovers that his vampiric regeneration makes most attacks useless, so he sets up a plan to get Dio into the heart of the inferno burning down the mansion, hoping that it will be enough to hurt him faster than he can regenerate. In their battle in Dio's castle, Dio is essentially untouchable thanks to his ability to freeze anyone solid in an instant, making the fight about Jonathan trying to come up with a way to get around that defense (as <em>well</em> as the vampiric regeneration).
</li><li> A notable example in Part 2 is Joseph vs. Esidisi, which ended in the two trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">Out-Gambit</a> each other repeatedly with Hamon-powered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RazorFloss">Razor Floss</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBloodRunsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBloodRunsHot">prehensile blood-vessels filled with 1000-degree blood.</a>

</li><li> With Stands, most of the fights consist of matches against a seemingly untouchable Stand user, with the main characters spending most of the time trying to figure out how their opponent's Stand works so they can combat it, often in very unconventional ways (i.e., a Stand that exists as air defeated by being breathed in by another Stand until the enemy Stand user suffocates.)
