<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote">Death Note</a></em>: Though Light is one of the suspects of the Kira case from the very beginning, his father's status as the Chief of Police is what protects him from being seriously considered as such by the normal police and he knows it.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the first few episodes, Helmeppo can do whatever he likes because his father, Axe-Hand Morgan, runs the town. Morgan actually hates his son but lets him use his name and authority as long as it doesn't put a dent in his ego.
</li><li> The World Nobles are an even more extreme example. If there's someone they can't shoot and is openly defying them, an admiral gets involved immediately. Arguably the only people in the world who could get away with defying the World Nobles are the Four Emperors — not even the Seven Warlords of the Sea (who have a notorious amount of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateJobSecurity">Ultimate Job Security</a>) can get away with that. Though this is because one of the Emperors <em>alone</em> is enough to challenge the World Government and the Marines with sheer manpower rather than any kind of strong influence beyond that of pirates.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Doflamingo is able to fake quitting the Seven Warlords because he is a former World Noble. According to him, he isn't considered one anymore by the others, but he still holds clout as a descendant of one of the World Government's founding families. And apparently knows something that allows him to blackmail the World Government.</span>
</li><li> Caesar Clown attempts to invoke this trope at the tail end of the Punk Hazard arc, citing all of the people who rely on his factory, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the weapons he makes from it, and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">all the children who suffer under him</a></span>.

<ul><li> This happens in the novel and is not the only example in the series.

</li><li> Averted in the fourth <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> movie, <em>Captured in her Eyes.</em> When the police superintendent learns that his son had a connection to a murder case, he personally orders the investigation re-opened to discover the truth.

Not that this stops him.
</li><li> Miyano from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagaTsuki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagaTsuki">Maga Tsuki</a></em> is able to get so much stuff done via this method that it borders on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarping">Reality Warping</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Judge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Judge">Judge</a></em>, the reason the drunk truck driver that ran over the protagonist's brother didn't get the full sentence he deserved was that he was well-acquainted with the judge, and had everyone on the jury being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney">bribed</a>.
</li><li> Season One of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HellGirl">Hell Girl</a></em> early episodes featured some antagonists who were like this.
</li><li> Used by both the heroes and the villains in the various iterations of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/GhostInTheShell">Ghost in the Shell</a></em> franchise. Quite memorably, in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GhostInTheShellStandAloneComplex">Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</a></em> TV series, a perp managed to avoid conviction partially thanks to this trope, and in response <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero">Chief Aramaki</a> quietly arranged his "accidental" death in a car accident and hushed up any investigation that might follow, neatly demonstrating that the trope goes both ways. In another incident, some college kids were running an amateur organ black market, under the impression that their influential parents would get them out of any trouble. The Major <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BringMyBrownPants">literally scares the piss out of them instead</a>, though her motivations were more personal than getting around their connections.

Needless to say, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Sena won that round.</a>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AkameGaKill">Akame ga Kill!</a></em>, the depraved group Wild Hunt often excuse their actions by pointing out that they are sanctioned by the government, and their leader Syura is the son of Prime Minister Honest.

<ul><li> Thomas Cromwell is a member of a covert reading group of John Tyndale's English translation of the Bible, who face death by burning if discovered (as indeed several of them are). Cromwell is a little safer than people like Little Bilney because he's the right hand of Cardinal Wolsey, and it's an unspoken understanding between the two of them that he's allowed his little bit of heresy because of their friendship. (Cromwell also pays close attention to when Wolsey mentions names from the group and warns them of forthcoming raids. Later, when he's Master Secretary and thus becomes the Connection, he <em>tries</em> to arrange an escape for John Frith, but Frith refuses to take it.)
</li><li> Cromwell later does this from the other end in an example of "screw the rules <em>for</em> my connections." When he's put in charge of bringing down Anne Boleyn, he's reminded by his accomplices of Thomas Wyatt, a poet with a well-known crush on Anne. Henry Wyatt is a family friend who once asked Cromwell to look after his wayward son, so when Mark Smeaton names Thomas Wyatt as one of Anne's partners, Cromwell refuses to add him to the list and refuses his accomplices' advice to arrest him until Wyatt arrives in London and Cromwell has no choice but to take him in. Even then he puts Wyatt in the Tower of London only for protective custody and doesn't even start a case in the hopes that the well-publicized executions of Anne and her five accused lovers will take the heat off. It does, and he releases Wyatt unharmed a little while later.

</li><li> This almost has to be happening for Lee "Apollo" Adama in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica (2003)</a></em>. Having your dad be the head of the Colonial Military can mean you get cut a lot of slack. At the end of season 1, he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">commits mutiny and puts a gun to the head of <em>Galactica</em>'s XO</span>, but this doesn't seem to hurt his career much. Towards the end of season 2, he's even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">promoted to commander (over a few higher-ranking and more-experienced officers, the aforementioned XO included — though events early in the season hint said XO wouldn't be the best commander) and put in charge of his own Battlestar</span>. And is there any other explanation for in season 4 when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">despite the pressing need for experienced pilots at all times, he is allowed to quit the military for good and gets shoehorned into a Quorum seat, which allows him to temporarily rise to be president when Roslin is missing, mostly because they needed a candidate his father would accept</span>? Given what we have seen of the lack of options open to ordinary people of the fleet and the need for all those in essential positions to do their duty all the time, one can't help but feel Lee is lucky to have the opportunities he has. And, in fact, he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshades</a> this a bit. At <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Baltar's trial</span>, specifically, he notes that he had done some ridiculous things that should have gotten him prosecuted at least... but he was forgiven.
</li><li> Part of a climactic scene in late season three of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter">Dexter</a></em>.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones">Bones</a></em>, Brennan appears to have some fairly high connections of her own, as indicated in one episode in which a State Department agent was reviewing the Jeffersonian to maintain their security clearance:
<div class="indent"><strong>Pickering</strong>: When you were in Cuba, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident">did you meet with a man named Juan Guzman?</a> <br/><em>(<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">Beat</a>.

Him. <em>(pauses)</em> Someone from the state department named Samantha Pickering. <em>(gives phone to Pickering)</em> <br/><strong>Pickering</strong>: Pickering. <em>(pauses)</em> Yes, sir. Yes, I'll wait-I'll wait here. <em>(gives phone back to Brennan, who hangs up)</em> <br/><strong>Brennan</strong>: Any more questions? <br/><strong>Pickering</strong>: No. Uh, no, in fact, the entire review is suspended.

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>:
<ul><li> Castle is a surprisingly benign version of this... while he uses his influence as a best-selling mystery author (and the fact that he has the mayor on speed dial) to be allowed to shadow Detective Beckett, he has proved quite useful, with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy">Genre Savvy</a> providing breakthroughs in several cases, and on one occasion using his connections to rush evidence through the lab to close a case.
<div class="indent"><em>[after making a bet on whether or not their Vic of the Week was a CIA agent]</em> <br/><strong>Beckett:</strong> All right, you're on! <br/><em>[Castle dials a number]</em> <br/><strong>Beckett:</strong> ...who are you calling? <br/><strong>Castle:</strong> My guy in the CIA. <br/><strong>Beckett:</strong> <em>[disbelieving]</em> You have a guy in the <em>CIA</em>??? <br/><strong>Castle:</strong> When will you learn? I've got a guy <strong>everywhere</strong>.
</div></li><li> Captain Montgomery is good at subverting this. He later reveals to Beckett that he could have gotten rid of Castle at any time ("The mayor doesn't run this place, I do."), but only kept him around because he thought it would be good for her. Also, when a suspect threatens to call the police commissioner, he replies "Tell him I said hi. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity">And that I could use a raise</a>."
</li></ul></li><li> Practically everyone on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars">Veronica Mars</a></em> is guilty of some version of this. Veronica herself constantly exploits any and all connections she has in law enforcement. Usually justifiable, considering she lives in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Neptune</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse">Dollhouse</a></em>, it's not a person but the title business. It largely survives because it has a lot of rich and powerful people, including at least one senator and the Governor of California, on its client list.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns">As the World Turns</a></em> loves this trope because of its legacy families. Many of the characters, even just with ties to super couples and their parents/children, tend to be able to get away with anything on connections alone.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice">Burn Notice</a></em>, one scumbag <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParent">Abusive Parent</a> uses his connections to protect his mobster brother. When Michael and company take out the scumbag by making him look like an unstable lunatic, it's mentioned in the epilogue that the brother will likely go down with him.
</li><li> This is the main reason why the Office of Disruptive Services team on <em>Chaos</em> is able to operate the way they do. They have connections going all the way to the White House. Their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> boss wants them fired, but as long as they do not screw up in a major way, their everyday misdeeds will go unpunished.
</li><li> One of the major themes on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire">The Wire</a></em>. Clay Davis and Ervin Burrell are two of the biggest offenders.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueerAsFolk">Queer as Folk</a></em>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerCop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillerCop">police officer</a> who frequently uses male prostitutes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToKillHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToKillHim">accidentally strangles one of them</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG">JAG</a></em>: Meg Austin's father was a friend with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCameo">Colonel Oliver North</a> (of the Iran-Contra scandal fame). Meg calls in a favor from "Uncle Ollie" once or twice when they need info they can't get through official channels.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Life" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Life">Life</a></em>, Russian gangster Roman Nevikov has a whole bunch of FBI agents in his pocket, which allows him to walk away from pretty much any criminal charges the LAPD cares to bring by claiming to be a federal informant providing information about terrorist networks.
</li><li> Done humorously in the movie <em>Ike: Countdown to D-Day</em>. The film made a point of showing Montgomery's (historically true) prohibition on smoking in his headquarters or at meetings he's attending, even to the point that Eisenhower, his superior in the Allied chain of command, wasn't allowed to light up. During the briefing for Operation Overlord given to King George VI, the king pulls out a cigarette, much to the distress of Monty who clearly isn't willing to tell his monarch that smoking is banned in the building. Immediately almost all the other senior Allied commanders, including Eisenhower, start smiling and also light up.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ser Jaime and Tyrion of the wealthy and powerful House Lannister get by on Tywin's and Cersei's reputation as well as their family's gold. Subverted in "Walk of Punishment" when Jaime tries to bribe Locke into releasing him. Locke gives Jaime a well-deserved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">"The Reason You Suck" Speech</a>, mocking him for acting as if he's better than others and in control, when in fact nearly all of his influence and power comes from his father, and that when separated from him Jaime is helpless and should talk more wisely. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">To emphasize his point, he then lops off Jaime's hand.</span>
</li><li> Tywin Lannister, probably the most powerful (and certainly the richest) person in Westeros, backs the Baratheons of King's Landing to the hilt, allowing them to pretty much do whatever they want, no matter the obstacles. Unfortunately, this has also extended to the borrowing of money, leading to the Baratheons of King's Landing acquiring astronomical amounts of debt which they are largely unable to service.
</li></ul></li><li> Used frequently in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawandOrderSpecialVictimsUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawandOrderSpecialVictimsUnit">Lawand Order Special Victims Unit</a></em>. Though expect whoever just got off on that to get killed shortly after by a victim that couldn't care less.
</li><li> Subverted in the mini-series <em>Nancy Wake</em>. Wake's husband, industrialist Henri Fiocca, tells a Gestapo officer that he can be talking on the phone with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">Marshall Petain</a> in half an hour. "Can you do the same with your Fuhrer?" Later on, he's arrested and the Gestapo officer tells him, "By the way, Marshall Petain has never heard of you."
</li><li> Deconstructed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine">Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></em> in an episode where the Deputy Commissioner's son is revealed to have been tagging police cars with graffiti, but whenever he gets arrested he calls his father, who puts pressure on the arresting detectives to drop the charges. While venting to Captain Holt, Detective Peralta enviously calls the kid lucky, which gets this response:
<div class="indent"><strong>Holt:</strong> I wouldn't say he was lucky. I feel bad for this kid. I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything?
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlueBloods">Blue Bloods</a></em>, the Reagan kids avert this trope in that they refuse to use their father's clout as Police Commissioner. In "Critical Condition," Sosa suggests that with Jamie's family connections, he could have made Detective by now. That said, other characters try to invoke the trope, to mixed results:
<ul><li> Inverted in "Parenthood," when Mayor Carter Poole's illegitimate daughter Ariel joins a protest and is caught up in the ensuring dragnet. Ariel doesn't demand special treatment, but her parents politely suggest, separately, that Frank had better let the matter drop.
</li><li> In "Rush to Judgment," Jamie is accused of undue force (he was actually trying to knock someone out of the path of an oncoming biker), a D.A. makes it clear she thinks he's guilty and his father must be covering for him. When video proves Jamie innocent, the woman continues to smark about his family always getting their way.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jamie</strong>: If my family really threw their weight around like you say...how smart is it for you to be insulting us?
</div></li><li> In "Men in Black," Jamie and Vinny arrest the previous mayor's daughter and her friend after catching them in the act of smoking pot on a park bench. When preparing to arrest them, said daughter tries to invoke this:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rebecca Levitt:</strong> Don't you guys have any real criminals to chase? <br/><strong>Jamie Reagan:</strong> You might want to ease up on that attitude, Rebecca. <br/><strong>Rebecca Levitt:</strong> You don't know who my father is. <br/><strong>Jamie Reagan:</strong> <em>[smirks]</em> I don't really care.
</div></li><li> Of course, after a discussion with Erin her dad tells the judge:
<div class="indent"><strong>Rebecca's father:</strong> I would like to tell the court that my daughter is a wonderful young woman... <em>[<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Beat">beat</a>]</em> ...who needs to learn to respect the law.
</div></li><li> The bad guys don't have a monopoly on this. In "Warriors" the State Department refuses to grant political asylum to a Turkish cellist in danger of being the victim of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorRelatedAbuse">honor killing</a> if she returns home (for having dated and slept with an American during the tour). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Frank talks a contact into getting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra to hire her, and his opposite number at State, the episode's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SympatheticInspectorAntagonist">Sympathetic Inspector Antagonist</a>, expedites a work visa.</span>
</li><li> There's an implication that when Nicky is arrested with her friends in "Road to Hell" after drugs are found in the car during a traffic stop that Nicky was expecting the process to be easier for her on the basis of her last name.
</li><li> In "In the Box," Garrett's stepson Sam has been arrested for scoring oxycodone during an observational buy. Garrett wants to have him released into rehab. However, Frank is suspicious of the circumstances and has his secretary Abigail Baker investigate, discovering that Garrett has used his pull at 1PP to keep Sam out of prison on several prior occasions. Frank confronts Garrett and gets him to see that he's enabling his stepson's drug habit and not helping him.
</li><li> In "Dedications," Frank brings up having to use Henry's influence to squash a commendation when a botched attempt to arrest the head of a Westies gang faction led to the death of the guy's wife and grandson.
</li><li> It's played almost ridiculously straight in one episode which features the Deputy Commissioner cheating on his wife during a marital spat with a woman in Atlantic City. He makes it clear that the affair was mutual, admits to lying about his position when he met the woman, and she has pictures of text messages they sent to each other. The DPC is ready to resign, as he doesn't want to bring a scandal down on the department...so Frank asks his father to call up his old buddies on the Atlantic City force to put some pressure on the woman to "disappear," <em>specifically saying</em> he wants Henry to do it off the record so it can't be traced back to him. What makes it particularly egregious is that the episode's A-plot features Danny going on a rant about how priests lie to cover up child molesters (which, while true, turns out to have <em>nothing</em> to do with the case at hand). And the show doesn't even mention the parallels. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViewersAreGoldfish">Maybe the producers thought no one would notice.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing">The West Wing</a></em>, an inversion of this got Charlie Young his job as personal assistant to President Bartlett. Deborah Fiderer was pressured to give Charlie's position to the son of a prominent Democratic supporter (read: donor), but she wouldn't do it and ended up getting fired as a result. Despite this, though, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesImDoingWhatsRight">refused to admit what had happened</a> as she didn't want Charlie to feel obliged to her for doing what she knew was right. The President is so impressed by her loyalty (and amazing memory) that he hires her to become his new private secretary.
</li><li> In the Australian series <em>Halifax f.p.</em>, a detective working an interstate case is threatened with damage to his career by a local politician. When the detective points out that he's not even from that state, the politician indicates the club they're standing in, and talks of how politicians from all over the country pass through the club when visiting his state, and how politics is all about working these connections...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Daredevil2015">Daredevil (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Nelson &amp; Murdock's difficulty in taking down Wilson Fisk is because Fisk is deeply connected, with corrupt cops and senators on his payroll.
</li><li> Karen Page gets her job at the <em>New York Bulletin</em> because Mitchell Ellison feels bad about not having previously supported Ben Urich, who he knew had been close with Karen and had been mentoring her through her investigation of Wilson Fisk up until Fisk killed Ben. It's clear that Karen's connection to Ben and to Ellison is why she's getting a job with one of New York City's major newspapers <em>and</em> immediately getting a private office, despite not having any journalism degree or prior experience in the field. (Most reporters would be lucky to get a cubicle to start)
</li><li> Rosalie Carbone, introduced in the last two episodes of <em>Luke Cage</em> season 2 prior to showing up in <em>Daredevil</em> season 3, has immense influence in organized crime. She has as much control over the underworld in Rikers as Fisk does.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JessicaJones2015">Jessica Jones (2015)</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jessica attempts to use the connections of her acquaintances when trying to acquire sufentanil that she can use against Kilgrave. She tries to ask Trish if she has connections to any shady doctors who might be willing to slip her some, but Trish says that all the doctors she knows save small African villages and wouldn't be easy to persuade. So she next goes to Jeri Hogarth's ex-wife Wendy, who is a doctor. Wendy is not helpful either, because on top of not giving a damn about Jessica she works in a clinic and sufentanil is surgical anesthesia. So Jessica just resorts to stealing some from a hospital, using Malcolm as a distraction.
</li><li> It's how Trish manages to identify the security firm that Kilgrave has hired to protect him in case Jessica uses the sufentanil to knock out his powers. As she explains to Simpson:
<div class="indent"><strong>Trish Walker:</strong> I might have a lead. <br/><strong>Will Simpson:</strong> So, you gonna tell me? <br/><em>[Trish walks past Simpson, gets an envelope on the table behind them, and passes to him. He opens it. Inside are the pictures of various people in black shirts]</em> <br/><strong>Will Simpson:</strong> Mmm, military. <br/><strong>Trish Walker:</strong> Ex. They're bodyguards. Kilgrave's new bodyguards. <br/><strong>Will Simpson:</strong> And how do you know? <br/><strong>Trish Walker:</strong> I went to all the top New York security firms, told them an old stalker of mine was back, that I was in the market for a new protection detail. After that, it was just a matter of getting the right people to talk. <br/><strong>Will Simpson:</strong> No way. The first rule of personal security is to keep your clients secret. <br/><strong>Trish Walker:</strong> I give good talk.
</div></li><li> Played for laughs in a later episode. When Jessica and Trish are searching the morgues looking for Kilgrave's father, Trish bribes Maury Tuttlebaum, the morgue attendant at Riverbank Medical Center, into letting them search the bodies by getting him the chef's table at Per Se.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jessica Jones:</strong> Dinner at the fancy restaurant is supposed to buy us quiet assistance.
</div></li><li> In season 2, Trish uses another favor with Maury to get him to fast-track the identification of a charred skull she and Jessica find in Dr. Hansen's incinerator.
</li><li> In episode six of season 2, Trish and Jessica try to enter a private country club to talk to Dr. Karl Malus's donor Justis Ambrose. But because Trish is not a member there, the maitre'd refuses to let them through despite recognizing Trish. Ultimately, Jessica has to sneak in by hopping over a wall while Trish just launches a tirade at the maitre'd by calling him a sexist, which culminates in her eventually throwing up due to going through the withdrawal of being off Simpson's inhaler.
</li><li> In episode four of season 2, Trish's new boyfriend Griffin Sinclair offers to use his pull as a newscaster at ZCN to get Trish a job there. She politely declines, saying, "I love you for offering, but going to them as Griffin Sinclair's girlfriend won't get me taken seriously," and she would rather get the job by her own merits than her connections.

After much discussion with Colleen, Danny decides to go to the Hand's headquarters at Midland Circle in his capacity as the CEO of Rand Enterprises. Unfortunately, it's a trap, and while he manages to fight off most of Alexandra's men, he's almost captured, until Luke, Jessica, and Matt show up to rescue him.
</li><li> The pull Luke has with Misty Knight from their work on Cottonmouth and Diamondback is how he's able to convince her to stash Claire Temple, Colleen Wing, Malcolm Ducasse, Trish Walker, Foggy Nelson, and Karen Page in her precinct when the Hand begin targeting them.
</li><li> The Hand have thrived for so long because of their use of connections. They use contacts in the mayor's office and Trish's radio station to shut down talk about the earthquake triggered by underground mining at Midland Circle. After Elektra kills Alexandra, the remaining fingers - Murakami, Bakuto and Madame Gao - try to reason with her by pointing out that the Hand's connections are what gives them power and has allowed them to survive, but Elektra flat-out tells them she doesn't care about them beyond using them as tools to get the substance.

<div class="indent"><strong>Steven Gomez:</strong> So I bust this chef. Well, he says he's a chef, but just because you work at a restaurant that charges $14 for a burger, that don't make you a chef.

The section does mention that it can't be used to, say, have the party's Mage Hunter use his contacts in the Retribution of Scyrah to call in a couple of Mage Hunter Strike Teams to clear out an Orgoth ruin for them.
<ul><li> Played somewhat more straight with one of the Aristocrat career's starting abilities, Privilege. Short version is that he's immune to persecution for petty crimes and can only be tried by a court of his peers (meaning other nobles). A successful Etiquette roll can let the character demand hospitality and request aid from a noble not at war with his kingdom (so don't expect Cygnaran noble to get much help in Khador or the Protectorate) and gets a nice bonus so social skill rolls made against people of a lower station who recognise him as a noble. Drawback is that the punishments from a high court are typically quite severe.

His grandfather is the ultra-rich owner of... pretty much everything, so Ed gets away with... well, pretty much everything. Take, for example, his foray into bank robbery. It was bungled about as badly as it could have been, and when they get into the car, they start arguing and eventually ask the bank manager (who they had also kidnapped) for a second opinion. Later, back at Ed's house, a police officer shows up to return Ed's wallet, which he lost at the bank <em>while in the process of robbing it</em>. He even apologizes for having wasted Ed's time. It helps when your grand-dad owns both the police and the bank in question.

Eventually, however, the store manager catches on when he finds that the other manager is always signing off on no-charge purchases on the deli production sheets for that specific customer, plus security camera footage shows the customer deliberately looking for things they didn't currently have available.

Chaos ensued.
<ul><li> Terrible behavior by army spouses (usually wives of officers) trying to abuse their partners' rank is relatively common in many military settings; in the US armed forces, perpetrators are invariably reviled and the most common real effect is an embarrassed apology from the spouse holding the actual rank. The on-base slur for such people in the US are "Dependas"<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note02lkr');"><sup>Translation </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note02lkr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note02lkr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Shortening of "Dependents"</span>
</li><li> In the British Army, there is a sort of informal convention that implicitly dictates that, in the parellel hierarchy of military wives, the Colonel's Lady is "first among equals". This is reflected in the informal status given to the Regimental Sergeant Major's wife. (the RSM is the most senior enlisted soldier). Whilst this bestows informal power, the wise postholder will understand she is only there as a mirror of her husband's rank and will go about using the status informally and gently - to suggest, rather than order, and to use it in ways which support her husband in his job, and be constructive in the wider Batallion family.
</li><li> In the Russian and especially the Soviet military,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1p0ob');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1p0ob" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1p0ob');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The Soviet officers pay was relatively meager, and after the dissolution of the USSR, it became almost a laughingstock until finally adjusted to the more adequate values in the 2010s.</span> the problem was less pronounced for the one simple reason: as the officers' pay was often insufficient to fully support a family, the officers' (and <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NCOs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NCOs">NC Os</a>') spouses had to find the work on-base, usually as a support personnel like cooks, teachers, clerks, comm specialists, etc., giving the base commanders better control over their personnel's dependents.

</li><li> This mindset is <a class="urllink" href="http://muqata.blogspot.com/2006/10/proteczia-israels-vitamin-p.html">so inherent to Israeli culture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that it has its own special term — "Proteqzia" — sometimes sardonically referred to as "Vitamin P".
<ul><li> The word comes from either Russian or Polish, as this was where most of the Israel's founders stemmed from, and, naturally, the practice is endemic in both countries as well. That said, in the XX century Russia it became to be more frequently called "blat", probably from the German word "Blatt", "a leaf", meaning the written note of reference originally carried by the favor's recipient to prove his connection.

</li><li> As any Army field officer knows, either knowing the right people in QM or having an NCO/private/dogsbody who does and being deliberately ignorant of how they go about their business leads to wonderful things being acquired for the unit that are either unavailable/waiting in a depot somewhere/need to be requested in triplicate.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RaoulWallenberg" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RaoulWallenberg">Raoul Wallenberg</a> actually used this trope for <em>good</em> purposes, when he claimed Swedish <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiplomaticImpunity">Diplomatic Impunity</a> while rescuing Jews from the Nazis.
</li><li> Ditto with Oskar Schindler and Albert Goering, the latter being the younger brother of the Nazi Reichsmarschall, both of whom used their connections to save Jews and other victims of Nazism.
</li><li> The Royal Italian Army was filled with officers who got away with gross incompetence and were promoted due to friendship with important people. Among the worst examples we have:
<ul><li> Captain Hercolani Gaddi. During the initial Italian conquest of Libya, Hercolani Gaddi was placed in control of Sokna and tasked with supplying the troops of colonel Miani, sent to occupy Fezzan, but failed in his task for no apparent reason, resulting in Miani being forced to retreat and not be able to suppress the start of the revolt that nearly kicked the Italians out of Libya. In the following investigation, Hercolani Gaddi was not touched thanks to his friendship with generals Martini and Tassoni
</li><li> General Pietro Badoglio. Having anticipated the Austro-Hungarians would try and break through Italian lines at Volzana (an obvious weak point in his sector), he not only disobeyed orders to fortify the first line and keep the artillery ready for a fighting retreat (he placed his artillery in such a way they could shell into oblivion any breakthrough but could not escape if anything went wrong), but he did so in such a way as so his artillery would be unable receive his orders to open fire or even <em>see</em> they should have opened fire if the Austro-Hungarians attacked with mist (precisely the reason Cadorna wanted a fighting retreat). When the Austro-Hungarians attacked with misty weather as part of the Caporetto offensive they captured the artillery, making the defeat much worse (the main breakthrough happening at Caporetto, hence the name of the battle), but Badoglio was not sacked, and in fact entered the staff of Cadorna's replacement Armando Diaz, thanks to his friendship with the king and his prime minister.
</li></ul></li><li> Despite hard evidence, football player Matthew Barnett was acquitted of raping Daisy Coleman because his grandfather was a state Senator.
</li><li> Similarly, <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Jessica_Lal">Manu Sharma<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was acquitted of <em>murder</em> despite hard evidence, because his father was an influential MP. In this case, however, the public outcry was enough to see Sharma retried and convicted.
</li><li> The very concept of <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasta">Wasta<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the Middle East, especially the Arabian Peninsula. Simply put, who you know allows you to act above what is the written law. Its origins are rather interesting, as the Middle East is built upon tribal and familial connections in what was until modern times, a harsh and lawless land. Therefore, most native Middle Easterners see connections not as an illegal way, but as a quasi-legal alternative. While the very concept grates on the modern notion of "merit above all", the system of Wasta reinforces existing connection and trust; after all, if you personally know someone and can attest to that person's character, he or she would naturally be preferred to a stranger, even with an equal amount of skill. In essence, it's the phrase "better the devil you know" taken to its logical conclusion. To say that this is bordering on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> would of course, be an understatement, and with the entry of these countries to the global marketplace, frictions between native Middle Easterners and expatriates have been on the increase and are not expected to go away any time soon.
</li><li> The Renaissance painter Caravaggio was an out-and-out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> that outright assaulted and killed multiple people during his life, only escaping being arrested because the Catholic Church was one of his patrons and the cardinals that he painted for pulled strings to keep him out of jail, even when he murdered someone in a tennis court with <em>over twenty witnesses</em>.
<ul><li> It helped that Caravaggio (with the help of his influential friends) was able to pass most of his murders as duels, which were somewhat accepted, although in at least half of the cases these were outright assaults instead of genuine mano-a-manos.
</li></ul></li><li> As the documentary <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisFilmIsNotYetRated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThisFilmIsNotYetRated">This Film Is Not Yet Rated</a></em> has pointed out, the MPAA seems to be more lenient with their ratings if the film they're looking over was produced/backed by a studio. If the film was independently produced, they'll be far more strict.
</li><li> British investigative journalist Stephen Knight looked into long-standing allegations of corruption among Freemasons operating under vows of secrecy and concluded that in many areas, including the process of law, there was a case to answer. One case concerned a Freemason in a messy divorce who boasted to his wife that he'd "fixed" the case so that the judge was also a Mason and would resolve the divorce in a manner wholly favourable to him. Unfortunately, the Masonic judge had to withdraw from the hearing as he was ill, and a replacement, assigned impartially by the court, turned out to be one of Britain's few <em>women</em> judges. The divorce did not go as the husband planned it. Not at all. But when checking out the judge who would have taken the case, Knight discovered he - and the husband - both belonged to the same Masonic lodge, which meant that both parties were knowingly engaging in a conflict of interests and impartiality.
</li><li> The executives and regulators in the US financial industry are close friends with each other, with regulators often joining executive boards after they leave the SEC or FTC. Thanks to these close personal relationships, the architects of the 2008 financial crisis pocketed their salaries and fat benefits packages while the federal government bailed their collapsing businesses out from bankruptcy and thousands of ordinary people lost their homes.
</li><li> Russia is friends with China, Iran, and Turkey, who are only too happy to help Russia to subvert sanctions imposed upon Russia by western countries and have done so in the past.
</li><li> Cultures influenced by Confucian thought are heavily based on this as well, which contributes to the endemic corruption within their governments. It's based on the Chinese practice of <em>guanxi</em>, where a group of associates takes care of each other. The whole "we take care of our own" philosophy.
