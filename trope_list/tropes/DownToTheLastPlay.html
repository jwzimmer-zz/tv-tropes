</li><li> Every <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Basketball">basketball</a> game ends with free throws with no time left or a three-pointer made in desperation. Often from across the court.

</li><li> A sudden-death overtime, in which any play that results in a score is by definition the last play.
</li><li> And so on.
</li></ul><p>Of course, this is not to say that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">the hero team</a> will necessarily be successful and win the game in this final play. It's become a trope itself to have the final shot miss, the closing field goal go wide right, or that last deep fly ball to die at the warning track in order to present a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> and teach an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop">Aesop</a> that you can't always win and that it's okay to lose sometimes. (And also note that it <em>doesn't</em> make the example an aversion or subversion of this trope; the game is still decided on the final play, even if not in the protagonists' favor.) In Real Life examples this is even more prominent; close games that come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownToTheLastPlay">Down to the Last Play</a> are often contested by two evenly-matched teams, both of which are deserving of the win, and thus there isn't a clear protagonist if one is not in either team's fanbase.
</p><p>This happens because there are very few circumstances in which it is interesting to see a routine pop fly with a four run lead or a second string quarterback sit on the ball for three downs.

It often doesn't end up so fine and dandy though.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasket" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KurokoNoBasket">Kuroko no Basket</a></em> does this a few times, most notably during the Winter Cup and the <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoM" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoM">Go M</a>'s match with Jabberwock.
</li><li> Subverted in a wildly over-the-top fashion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SonicX">Sonic X</a></em> - the speed-obsessed character Sam Speed had demanded a rematch against the titular hedgehog, who had humiliated him at the start of the series. Sam has procured an experimental rocket-jet-car-thing from somewhere, and the race is on! It comes down to a photo finish... until playback reveals that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Sonic had reached the finish line WELL ahead of his opponent, hopped over it so as not to break the tape, mugged for the camera briefly, then run back to resume the race for the 'photo finish'.</span>
</li><li> Used at least <em>twice</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePrinceOfTennis">The Prince of Tennis</a></em>, with Ryoma having to play an extra match when one of the normal games is declared a draw or forfeited by both teams. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the Hyotei arc, he plays Hiyoshi after Kawamura and Kabaji have to draw since they're * both* too injured to continue and both teams. In the anime-only American arc, Sengoku and Bobby Marx pull something similar and Akaya Kirihara is hurt during his game with Kevin Smith, so it's up to Ryoma to finish the last one * and* his feud with Kevin</span>
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LuckyStar">Lucky Star</a></em>, there's a relay race in which Miyuki is the final leg runner for her team (it wouldn't do to have a main character somewhere in the middle), and the race is of course decided by a photo finish: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her <em>larger-than-average chest breaks the ribbon</em> before the other runner crosses, granting her team the victory.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kinnikuman">Kinnikuman</a></em> wins so many matches in this fashion that he's been nicknamed the "Miraculous Comeback Fighter."
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em> with one of the sports show episodes. Excel's team loses by a ludicrously huge margin (several million runs) in the last inning. Apparently the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> version of this trope is popular in Japan.
</li><li> <em>Every. Single. Lacrosse match</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FutariWaPrettyCure">Futari wa Pretty Cure</a></em> is won by Nagisa scoring at the last second. <strong>Every. One.</strong> This is not an exaggeration. And there are about 6-7 across two seasons. Originality is not the writers' friend when it comes to Lacrosse games, it seems.
</li><li> In Chapter 58 of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AhMyGoddess">Oh My Goddess!</a></em> manga, Megumi's four-member softball club forms a team with Keiichi, Belldandy, Urd, Skuld, and Sora to play against N.I.T.'s baseball team, composed entirely of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkasses</a>. During the bottom of the ninth, Megumi's team is ahead by one run when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> it looks like it's going to be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> when the opposing team scores two runs in the ninth inning, but the first runner failed to actually touch home plate, meaning he's out, and Megumi's softball club wins by one run.</span>
</li><li> Young <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FootyRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FootyRules">football</a> star Aizawa Suguru <em>starts off the opening chapter</em> of the manga <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AreaNoKishi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AreaNoKishi">Area no Kishi</a></em> by making what the announcers describe as a "magical pass" in the final moments of an international youth football game against Brazil. His teammates shot is easily blocked by the Brazilian goal-keeper, however since the deflected ball <em>just so happens</em> to land at Suguru's feet, he is able to make the last second shot that ends the game in a tie between Japan and the reigning champions.

It's a loss against St Gloriana: the low-velocity howitzer on the Panzer IV ausf D doesn't have the penetration needed to get through the Churchill's thick armor and they're taken out by a direct hit from its 75mm gun. They defeat Kuromorimine, however, when the Tiger only manages a grazing hit against Anglerfish's upgraded Panzer IV ausf H that deflects off the side of the turret and their improved 7.5cm KwK 40 cannon easily defeats the Tiger's rear armor.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanRadio">Older Than Radio</a>: In the 1888 Ernest Thayer poem <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaseyAtTheBat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CaseyAtTheBat">Casey at the Bat</a></em>, the great Casey strikes out to end the game. However, it's also an instance of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope">Unbuilt Trope</a>, because Casey deliberately let the first two balls go by as strikes so that he could hit the winning home run to look like an even bigger hero, and then blew it.
</li><li> Justified in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series: Quidditch matches end only when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenSnitch">Golden Snitch</a> is caught; catching the Snitch is also worth 150 points, usually resulting in a win for the team whose Seeker catches it. Thus, most matches end with the Seekers in a mad race for the Snitch. However, large portion of matches still end up by a winning team winning by 10 points.
<ul><li> The number of Harry Potter parodies that have pointed out how senseless this rule is are too numerous to list. ("This game is very complicated, but none of the rules actually matter, because once you catch this little golden thing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">everything else becomes irrelevant and your team automatically wins</a>.") Fans have pointed out that this may be because Hogwarts-level Quidditch isn't really very "good" Quidditch — the Quidditch World Cup scene shows scoring happening at a much faster rate, thus making the 150 points from the Snitch less impressive and increasing the probability that grabbing the Snitch too early might lose you the game (as was done deliberately in the Quidditch World Cup). Further, in the Hogwarts Quidditch tournaments, the exact score can matter for a team's placing, meaning even a team that would win when the Snitch is caught will wait if getting it too soon would win the game but lose the championship. (As happened with Gryffindor in <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, <em>Order of the Phoenix</em>, and <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>.)
</li><li> It also bears noting that J.K. Rowling's "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/QuidditchThroughTheAges">Quidditch Through the Ages</a>" book characterizes Quidditch's rules as primarily being a senseless, thrown-together mess of traditions kept for tradition's sake. (A lot like some real sports, come to think of it.) The Snitch itself only exists because of a riot that once broke up a Quidditch game when the players stopped playing to catch a bird intentionally released by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">the chief of the Wizard's Council</a> so that the players would hunt the bird for his own amusement rather than play Quidditch for his own amusement. The 150 number is how many gold coins he offered as an incentive, and we're told that it would be worth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculousFutureInflation">quite a bit more today</a>, so it's probably lucky that it's only 150.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmOfTheBook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FilmOfTheBook">film version</a> of <em>The Philosopher's Stone</em> emphasises this element of it further, although the likelihood is far more that this is a case of sloppy research than deliberately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshading</a> this trope - Wood explains to Harry, <em>directly after explaining scoring rules with the Quaffles</em>, that "you catch [the snitch], Potter, and we win."

On his 49th day, he had a mere $5,000 ($19,700 to $14,800) lead over the second place contestant and had to have the right answer (his opponent was incorrect) to win, which he did. Another of his games saw one of his opponents wager everything on a Daily Double late in Double Jeopardy! and guess correctly, and that opponent briefly took the lead before Jennings reclaimed the lead just before the end of the round; with Jennings leading by less than $2,000, both he and his opponent engaged in a truly dramatic Final Jeopardy! ... with Jennings winning.

Mark Ortega and Joseph "Bam-Bam" Mauro were pretty neck and neck coming into the Eliminator, with Mark given a 4-second penalty for trailing Joseph by eight points. In the Eliminator, Mark caught up to Joseph as the latter failed to climb the first wall, then fell as he made it over. The two are dead even as they fight past the medicine balls and Mark makes a dive across the line as Joe tears through the ribbon, leading to a photo finish. After reviewing the video, they determined that Mark crossed the finish line first when he threw his arm out over the line with a time of 48.86 compared to Joseph's 48.88, meaning Mark beat Joseph by <em>two hundredths of a second</em>.

<ul><li> In the English First Division (now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EnglishPremierLeague">Premier League</a>), Liverpool vs Arsenal at Anfield in 1989 is considered the most iconic example of this in football. By sheer coincidence, this match had been postponed due to the Hillsborough Disaster, and so took place on the last day of the league season. Having thrown away a significant lead they'd had earlier in the season, Arsenal were now three points behind Liverpool at the top of the table, with slightly inferior goal difference but having scored more goals. If they wanted the title, they'd have to beat Liverpool, at their home ground, by two goals or more, something no team had done in three years, and something Arsenal hadn't managed in <em>fifteen</em>. Furthermore, Liverpool had never previously been defeated when playing forwards John Aldridge and Ian Rush together. Arsenal had it all to do. Yet they went 1-0 up early in the second half thanks to an Alan Smith header. Then with 25 seconds left <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYeIlI3gutk">this happened.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> This goal was <a class="urllink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/mar/29/arsenal-liverpool-1989-football">credited not so long back<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (along with Hillsborough and the launch of Sky TV) with saving the institution of British football, which at the time had a (admittedly not undeserved) reputation as being filled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootballHooligans">Football Hooligans</a>, <em>especially</em> Liverpool. The Liverpool fans, who by rights should've been livid with having the title snatched from under their noses in the last ten seconds of the league (the celebratory champagne was even on its way to the Liverpool dressing room), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GracefulLoser">instead chose to applaud Arsenal's well-deserved victory.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> The Turkish national team was nicknamed "The Comeback Kings" in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/EuropeanChampionship">Euro</a> 2008 for doing this <em>repeatedly</em>:
<ul><li> Won against co-host Switzerland by a last-minute goal from outside the box in the group stages.
</li><li> Pulled back from 0-2 to 3-2 against the Czech Republic in 15 minutes, with the third goal scored in the last minute, also in the group stages.
</li><li> In the quarter finals, held off the much stronger Croatia for some 119 minutes after going to extra time, when, <em>one minute before the end</em>, Croatia scored. Since it's virtually impossible to score a goal with only a few seconds on the clock in soccer, Croatia's fans and management were already celebrating. Yet Turkey went on to score out of nowhere in the last minute and then win easily on penalties, having totally crushed Croatia's spirit with that incredibly unlikely comeback.
</li><li> Karma finally intervened in the semifinals, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GermanicEfficiency">Germany</a> scored the winning goal (3-2) in the 90th minute, denying the Turks an extra time they were already counting on. This match was infamous for the international TV coverage failing during the second half due to adverse weather conditions in the TV broadcast centre in Switzerland - many worldwide viewers saw little of the second half, while broadcasters in the UK and France switched to delivering their RADIO commentary through the TV for a time.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2006 MLS Cup. The New England Revolution scored 8 minutes into the second overtime to go up 1-0, but since it was not sudden death like many sports, the Houston Dynamo had time to score the tying goal - and did, just over a minute later. The Dynamo eventually won on penalty kicks.
</li><li> Likely the most famous example is the 1999 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UEFAChampionsLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/UEFAChampionsLeague">UEFA Champions League</a> Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich. With Bayern leading 1-0 going into stoppage time, United equalised with an absolutely wild goal and then scored the winning goal two minutes later with virtually the final kick of the game. The ending was so unexpected that they had to take the Bayern Munich ribbons off the trophy before presenting it. Not only did United win in the most dramatic fashion, but the victory made them the only English team to do "The Treble" — winning the UEFA Champions League, FA Cup and the Premier League in the same year.
<ul><li> This wasn't exactly novel for United — they did basically the same thing to overhaul Liverpool in the fourth round of the FA Cup earlier that season. In fact, they did this <em>so often</em> under Alex Ferguson (later Sir Alex) that the phenomenon was dubbed "Fergie Time". Moments before the equalizing goal in the aforementioned UEFA Champions League Final, English commentator Clive Tyldesley even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> it, remarking, "Can Manchester United score? They always score!"
</li></ul></li><li> In the last round of group matches during the 2002-03 Champions League first group stage, Newcastle United, having led Feyenoord 2-0 at one point, had been pegged back to 2-2. With Dynamo Kyiv trailing 1-2 to Juventus in the other match, the winner between Newcastle and Feyenoord would progress to the second group stage; if it was a draw Dynamo would progress instead. In the first minute of injury time, Craig Bellamy scored the winner to send Newcastle through to the next round. To date, Newcastle United are the only team in Champions League/European Cup history to lose their first three matches in a group stage and still progress to the next round.
</li><li> The 2004 Copa América Final between Brazil and Argentina. The score was 2-1, but Brazil managed to score a goal at the <em>last second</em>. This is made even more dramatic, because Brazil and Argentina are the biggest rivals in the history of football. Brazil then won the penalty shootout.
</li><li> Liverpool were 3-0 down against AC Milan at half-time in the 2005 UEFA Champions League final. Milan were considered to be possibly the best team on the planet at the time, while Liverpool had lost their star striker to Real Madrid the previous summer and wriggled into the final via luck, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">a never-say-die attitude</a> and a few moments of magic from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Steven</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">Gerrard</a>. Fifteen minutes into the second half, after three goals in six minutes, the score was 3-3. However, the actual last play was a double save from Liverpool's goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek against Andriy Shevchenko (then one of the best players on the planet) near the end of extra time that was later voted the greatest UEFA Champions League moment of all time. Those saved took the match all the way to penalties, which Liverpool won.
<div class="indent"> Andriy Shevchenko misses this with less than 3 minutes to go. You may as well start carving Liverpool's name on this trophy.
</div><ul><li> Earlier in the campaign, they needed to beat Olympiacos 1-0 or by 2 goals to progress to the knockout stage. Problem was, Olympiacos were the ones leading 1-0 at half time, which meant they needed to score at least three goals to progress. With three and a half minutes left, with the score at 2-1 to Liverpool, Gerrard responded with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9-P2UF9JIg">this goal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and the commentator promptly went berserk.
</li></ul><div class="indent"> OOOOH YA BEAUTY! What a hit, son! What a hit!
</div><ul><li> The following year, Liverpool were 3-2 down in the FA Cup final with only seconds left on the clock. The ball was lobbed into the box, knocked out and fell to Gerrard. The man could barely walk. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uVF74OqZDY">So he did this.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Once again, they won on penalties.
</li><li> Really, Liverpool are just as prone to this as United were under Alex Ferguson. Take their 2016 Europa League quarter-final against competition favourites Borussia Dortmund, who were in the process of challenging the near-unstoppable Bayern Munich for the German title. They would finish second in the Bundesliga and were one of the most feared teams in Europe, while Liverpool (then 8th in the Premier League) were generally seen as a fallen giant. The only advantages Liverpool had were manager Jurgen Klopp, who had previously managed Dortmund and knew the team inside out, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">stubbornness</a>. In the first leg, at Dortmund, they executed a perfect containment strategy, getting a 1-1 draw and thereby a valuable away goal<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7ozev');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7ozev" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7ozev');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In European club competitions, there's something called the away goals rule. If the two teams are tied on aggregate after the second match has ended, then the team that has scored more goals at the opponent's stadium goes through, with extra time only taking place if they have scored the same number of away goals.</span>. Dortmund responded by coming to Anfield and scoring two goals in the first eight minutes, putting them 2-0 up on the night and 3-1 up on aggregate, meaning that Liverpool had to win outright. Liverpool duly pulled one back, making it 2-1 (3-2). Dortmund promptly scored again, making it 3-1 (4-2). There were less than 25 minutes to go, but Liverpool steadily hauled down their technically-superior opponents, making it 3-3 (4-4). At this point, Dortmund were still going through on the away goals rule. Then, in stoppage time, Liverpool scored a 4th, making it 4-3 on the night and 5-4 on aggregate. In the words of the commentator, "Liverpool have come back from the dead!" Afterwards, #ComeBackKings was trending on Twitter, and most appropriate it was too.
</li></ul></li><li> Speaking of FA Cup Finals, the 1993 FA Cup Final was won by Arsenal in the dying seconds after defender Andy Linighan outjumped Sheffield Wednesday's Mark Bright to head home from close range. Even sweeter for Arsenal? Linighan was playing with a broken nose, having earlier been elbowed in the face... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedKarma">by Mark Bright</a>.
</li><li> FC Barcelona needed either a win or a score draw to advance to the 2009 Champions League final. After Chelsea took the lead 10 minutes in, the result didn't change until the third minute of stoppage time, when the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIrg7CFy2T4">"Iniestazo"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> happened.
</li><li> Jimmy Glass. The fate of Carlisle's attempt to avoid relegation from the Football League (and probable folding due to the subsequent financial blow) has come down to the fourth minute of injury time in the last game of the season, when Glass, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">their (on loan) goalkeeper, comes up for a corner</a>. Via a couple of rebounds and deflections, it comes to him in the six-yard box, and he duly pokes home. The result is the world's fastest pitch invasion, as 7,000 Carlisle fans immediately mob him in celebration, and one of the most iconic moments in Football League history.
</li><li> The Manchester Derby in September 2009 (voted the best match of the first 20 years of the Premier League) featured bad blood, great play, blunders, irony, and this trope. Already a heated match due to it being a local derby, tensions were even higher because of Carlos Tévez, who had left Manchester United and joined Manchester City in the previous offseason<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note80m49');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note80m49" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note80m49');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There had been much commotion from United fans to keep Tévez, but the United front office refused to do so, giving Tévez added incentive as well</span>. Three times, United scored; each time, City equalized, with the third equalizer coming in the 90th minute after a horrific mistake from normally-solid United defender Rio Ferdinand. With five minutes of added time given, a desperate long ball by United landed at the feet of Ryan Giggs, who found Michael Owen<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9c51j');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9c51j" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9c51j');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">who ironically was famous for his time at Liverpool, another fierce rival of Manchester United</span> unmarked. Owen duly scored with the last kick of the game, and United won 4-3. City complained that the added time was more than five minutes, with United fans firing back that the celebration for City's third goal was the reason more time was added on. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV1d4lwhVm8">See the highlights here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Qualifying for the 2010 World Cup between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, with Bahrain advancing on a draw, 1-1 as they head to stoppage time. Saudi Arabia scores one minute into stoppage time, breaking Bahrain's hearts <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1nMBPPum-M">until they score with seconds to play<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. As the commentator says, "Bahrain were down and out and dead and buried and now they're back in."
<ul><li> Unfortunately they were then beaten by New Zealand in the final World Cup play-off.
</li></ul></li><li> During the 2010 World Cup round-robin match between the United States and Algeria, the United States needed a win to advance. The score was tied at 0-0 going into stoppage time in the second half. Landon Donovan scored the winning goal for the United States during stoppage time, causing <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbn3rOPmR9w">very emotional reactions all over the United States<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> They did it again in World Cup qualifying action against Jamaica. They scored early to go up 1-0, but at 89', Jamaica equalized. At 90'+3', Michael Bradley passed to Bradley Evans, who slotted it in and won the match 2-1. The US went on to win all three June qualification games and take the lead in the Hex.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note104njl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note104njl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note104njl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Short for "Hexagonal", referring to the fact that the final group of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying has involved six teams since the 1998 qualifying cycle.</span> The USMNT eased from there to qualify for the World Cup proper.
</li></ul></li><li> A-League, 2006-07 Major Semi-Final. The first leg had ended goalless, and the second saw away team Adelaide United take an early lead, and even though home team Melbourne Victory equalised, Adelaide looked set to go through to, and host, the Grand Final on away goals. Two minutes into second half injury time, a substitute, who had never scored for Melbourne, and never did again, loops a header over the keeper and sends Melbourne into the Grand Final. Melbourne ended up crushing Adelaide 6-0 in the decider.
<ul><li> The 2010-11 Grand Final. Brisbane Roar, the red hot favourites, against the Central Coast Mariners, who have never won the Grand Final. The match goes into Extra Time at 0-0, when a substitution turns the game in the favour of the Mariners. They score in the 96th and 103rd minutes, leaving Brisbane 15 minutes to come back in the 2nd half of extra time. Time slowly ticks away, until the 117th minute comes and Brisbane score. The final kick of the game is a corner kick in the 120th minute, which one of their defensive midfielders jumps up and scores with. They then win the Grand Final 4-2 in a penalty shootout.
</li><li> The year after in the 2011-12 Grand Final, Brisbane came up against Perth Glory. Perth were massive outsiders, but fought and harassed the free flowing Brisbane team and scored through a Brisbane own goal in the 54th minute. Brisbane managed to push and force an equaliser in the 84th minute, then in the 4th minute of injury time Brisbane were awarded a penalty after their striker was tripped when about to shoot, he scored and won the game for Brisbane.
</li></ul></li><li> Happened not once, but arguably twice in the 1970 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWorldCup">World Cup</a> semi-final between Germany and Italy. Italy led 1-0 for all of regular time, until Germany equalized in the 90th minute, leading to extra time and a total of 5 goals, the final, decisive goal happening in the 111th minute. This game was dubbed the "Match of the Century" for a reason, and there's still a plaque at the stadium remembering it.
<ul><li> The two got to it again in 2006, where Italy won in extra time with goals in the 119' and 121' minutes - even more painful for Germany as they were hosts that year. The second goal broke a record that had stood since 1990, when England scored over Belgium at the 119th minute of their round of 16 game.
</li></ul></li><li> Arsenal v Liverpool in the 2010-11 Premier League; after an injury to Jamie Carragher, and other delays, the referee calls for <em>eight minutes</em> of stoppage time. Arsenal finally manage to work their possession and pretty play into an opening, they win a penalty in the 97th minute, Robin van Persie converts it in the 98th, 1-0 Arsenal, They Think It's All Over. It's not. The referee adds on time for the remonstrations and penalty, Liverpool win a free kick at the other end, it breaks towards Leiva, he's fouled, and Liverpool have a penalty of their own. Dirk Kuyt steps up and scores; the <strong>102nd</strong> minute goal really <em>is</em> the last play.
</li><li> The 2010 Europa League Final between Atlético Madrid and Fulham was decided by a last-minute goal in extra time from Atleti's Diego Forlán.
<ul><li> A final they were playing thanks to another extra-time goal by Forlán in the semi-final against Liverpool.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1995/96 season of the Danish Superliga, saw Brøndby IF (<em>the</em> top dog of the league) and Aarhus GF (fielding perhaps their best squad of the past 25 years) locked in a hard-fought duel for the title. In round 30 (of 33) the two faced each other on Aarhus' homefield, Brøndby leading the table by 1 point. In the dying moments of the first half Peter Møller pulled Brøndby ahead 0-1. After 75 minutes, however, Aarhus had pulled together an extraordinary comeback to lead 3-1. A late goal brought Brøndby some hope, and with about 2 minutes to go, Brøndby got a corner kick. On a whim, Brøndby's goalie, Mogens Krogh, decided to move into Aarhus' penalty area <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">in a desperate attempt to disrupt Aarhus' defence</a> (Krogh later admitted he didn't have the approval of coach Skovdahl to make this move). In a frantic play, Krogh managed to score the equalizer with 90 seconds to go. The match ended 3-3. At the season end, Brøndby secured the title with 67 points against Aarhus' 66.
<ul><li> Years later, Brøndby was fighting a battle to avoid relegation (it would have been their first ever, since reaching top flight football in 1982). As it happened, in the last round of matches, they would be playing away against AC Horsens, their main contender in the relegation battle. Thanks to a curious win the week before, Brøndby only needed a draw to stay up. However, the match was incredibly dirty, with the referee quickly losing control of the match, refusing to penalise very hard tackles made by AC Horsens players, while penalising Brøndby players at random. One tackle injured Brøndby's main striker, and when a Brøndby player complained to the referee, he recieved his second yellow card and was sent off. With Brøndby down to 10 men, AC Horsens came closer and closer to scoring. That is, until 3½ minutes into overtime, when <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U1Q9qQnAZs">this happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In the first leg of the 2012 Copa del Rey Quarterfinal, 3rd Division Mirandés were leading 1st Division Espanyol 2-0 in the 85th minute, but Espanyol came back to win 3-2. Then, in the second leg, the score was 1-1 in injury time before a last-minute free kick saw Mirandés win 2-1 and reach the semi-finals on away goals.
</li><li> The 2012 English Premier League was won in the last match of the season by Manchester City over Manchester United with two goals in stoppage time. United needed to beat Sunderland to stand a chance of overcoming City in the final standings, while City faced Queens Park Rangers. Both matches were played simultaneously; United scored against Sunderland after twenty minutes, putting the pressure on City. City scored against QPR after 39 minutes, retaking the title provisionally. Then QPR equalised after half time and with sixteen minutes remaining sensationally went ahead, leaving City needing two goals to win the Premier League. They got the equaliser right on full time and had five minutes of stoppage time to get another. At the same time United vs. Sunderland finished 1-0 in United's favour, leaving United looking like the champions until City's Sergio Agüero fired in a winner close to the end of stoppage time. The goal is known as "93:20", the timestamp of the match where Aguero scored.
<div class="indent"><strong>Martin Tyler:</strong> AgueroooOOOOOOOO! <em>[Agüero scores the goal, crowd goes wild]</em> I swear, you'll never see anything like this ever again! So watch it! Drink it in!
</div></li><li> A 2013 play-off semi-final between Watford and Leicester ended when the Watford goalkeeper blocked a penalty kick, and then blocked the followup shot before Watford drove the ball immediately down the field. Troy Deeney scored the winning goal just as time was about to be called, putting Watford up 3-2 on aggregate score and sending them to the final.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bill Leslie</strong>: Here's Hogg... DEENEY! <em>(crowd cheers)</em> Do not scratch your eyes! You are really seeing the most extraordinary finish here!
</div></li><li> The 2012 UEFA Champions League Final. In the red corner, Bayern Munich, playing on home turf. In the blue corner, Chelsea, who had eliminated FC Barcelona, the reigning Champions, in the semifinals with virtually the last kick of the tie after being 2-0 down with ten men. With seven minutes remaining, Bayern breach the Chelsea defence to take the lead. However, with two minutes of normal time remaining, Chelsea equalise. The match goes to penalties, and with literally the last kick of the game, Didier Drogba scores with his penalty to win the final for Chelsea. He also scored the equaliser, and with his announced intention to leave Chelsea, his penalty was also the last kick for him as a Chelsea player.
</li><li> The United States women's national soccer team seems to have a habit of this in recent tournaments.
<ul><li> In the 2011 Women's World Cup quarterfinal against Brazil, the USA were down 2-1 in extra time when Megan Rapinoe crossed a ball in to Abby Wambach, who headed it home to tie the game in the <em>122nd minute</em>. The USA would later go on to win in the penalty shoot out. Wambach's goal is the latest in World Cup history, and the second-latest in women's soccer history, behind...
</li><li> In the semifinal of the 2012 Olympic tournament, the USA came from behind to equalize against Canada three times. Fast-forward to the 123rd minute and Alex Morgan slotted home a header to win the game for the USA.
<ul><li> Not to be outdone, the Canadian women who suffered that loss against the USA would get <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVcTjFpy3M">a last-minute victory of their own<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in the bronze medal game, courtesy of a Diana Matheson header.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the 2008-2009 La Liga, Real Madrid (who needed a win to continue challenging uber-rival Barcelona for the league) were drawing 2-2 against Getafe in the 87th minute when a Getafe striker, Casquero, was tripped in the penalty area by Real defender Pepe. Getafe were awarded a penalty kick and Pepe was sent off, leaving his team a man down. Casquero stepped in to take the penalty himself, and did <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton&lt;!--C3--&gt;ADn_Panenka#Panenka_penalty">a Panenka<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a type of kick that if scored is considered humiliating for the goalkeeper. Real's keeper Iker Casillas, however, caught the ball and immediately passed it to his teammates, who went on to score before full-time. Casquero was the national punching bag for weeks after.
</li><li> Ghana were awarded a penalty kick in the very last moment of extra time against Uruguay in their 2010 World Cup quarter-final, after a clear goal for Ghana was punched away by Uruguay's Luis Suárez. The penalty was missed, leading to a penalty shootout which Ghana lost, eliminating the last remaining African team in the South Africa WC<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note11utz7');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note11utz7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note11utz7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Had Ghana won, they would have been the first African team ever to reach the semi-finals of a World Cup</span>.
</li><li> After coming back from a 3-0 loss with a 5-0 second leg win in the 2013/14 Europa League Quarterfinals, Valencia lose 2-0 to Sevilla in the first leg of the semis. In the second leg, they pull it off again, coming back to 3-0. Come the 93rd minute, former Valencia player Albelda comments on the radio how it was a done deal by then and how he never saw their comeback in danger, since Sevilla <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TemptingFate">clearly weren't going to score the away goal that would put them through in the few remaining seconds.</a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YACIao80q1M">You know where this is going<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The 2000/01 Bundesliga saw an example of this. "Plucky Underdog" Schalke 04 was chasing "Eternal Champion" Bayern Munich every game of the season. They were level on points after 32 of 34 matches and both headed towards a draw on the penultimate day of the season, when in the third minute of stoppage time almost at the same time Bayern and Schalke's opponent Stuttgart both scored. Thus before the last day, Schalke were trailing by 3 points, and with Bayern playing at Hamburg, only just above the relegation zone, all seemed sealed against Schalke, especially since they went down by two goals themselves against unfancied Unterhaching, only to equalize and immediately fall behind again. In the end, Schalke was able to turn the match around to a "comfortable" 5-3 victory. Then, unexpectedly, 2 minutes from time Hamburg scored the 1-0 against Bayern, putting Schalke in pole position on goal difference. And Hamburg defended the lead until the 4th minute of stoppage time, when a controversial ruling for a handled back pass (and of course Hamburg's goalkeeper who did this was on loan from Schalke) gave Bayern a last shot at the title. At the same time, the whistle was reported in Schalke as the final whistle, so that they would be champions for the first time in half a century, and pitch invasion and celebration followed immediately - until the live scenes were shown on the stadium screen (the free kick was somewhat delayed due to many protests in Hamburg). Bayern converted the last kick, by now 12 minutes in stoppage time, drew and thus became champions (again). Schalke since then carries the moniker "Meister der Herzen" (champion of hearts) and the validity of the ruling is still heftily discussed, with fans and players from both Schalke and Hamburg insisting to this day that this wasn't an intentional pass and thus could be handled.
</li><li> After coming from Lima with a 2-2 result against Sporting Cristal, FBC Melgar was having a very hard time against Sporting Cristal, despite being the locals, and despite they were scoring, Cristal scores, until the point that they were 2-2 and with that leading to end into a penalty shootout, where Cristal were well known to win in most scenarios. However, just 2 minutes before the end of the match and on the injury time, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSqzb5id71c">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> happened.
</li><li> The 2014 UEFA Champions League final. Minute 93. Atlético de Madrid are winning 1-0 against Real Madrid. Atleti fans are already savouring the title (which they have never won). Then, Real gets a corner kick... and Sergio Ramos heads it into Atleti's goal, literally tying the game in the last minute. The morale shock was so high that Real proceeded to curb-stomp Atleti in extra time to win 4-1.
<ul><li> Sergio Ramos has scored so many goals in the last play that the fans and the press jokingly call the extra time after minute 90 "Noventa y Ramos" (<em>Ninety Ramos</em>).
</li></ul></li><li> The 2016-17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16. FC Barcelona had lost to Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg by 4-0, which meant they had to win by 5 goals at least. They manage to score three goals in 50 minutes, but then Cavani scores again in minute 68 - which means they need three more goals. Neymar manages to score a free kick on minute 88, and then a penalty on 90. PSG tries to fortify itself... but in the last minute, Neymar kicks the ball into the box and Sergi Roberto kicks it in, scoring the 6-1 Barça needed to offset their previous loss and go on to quarter-finals. This is the first time in UEFA Champions League/European Cup history that a team has overcome a 4-goal deficit from the first leg to progress to the next round.
<ul><li> They become the victim of these <em>again</em> two years later. They are drawn against Manchester United, who suffer an inconsistent season under Jose Mourinho and had to replace him with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. They take 2-0 advantage going to the second leg courtesy of goals from Kylian Mbappe and Presnel Kimpembe with Man. United lost their talisman Paul Pogba after got red card in the first leg. PSG then proceed to implode themselves in the second leg against depleted United side. Romelu Lukaku scores in the second minutes after exploiting horrible backpass from Thilo Kehrer. PSG then equalise several minutes later, and United had to score at least two goal to advance. The usually solid Gianluigi Buffon then uncharacteristically failed to catch Marcus Rashford long range effort and the loose ball was exploited by Lukaku to bag his second goal. As the closing minutes draw to a close and United seems to eliminated in the round of 16 for two consecutive year, substitute Diogo Dalot tries his luck with long range strike. The ball struck the arm of Presnel Kimpembe, and after some VAR reviewing the referee awarded penalty to United. Rashford then stepped up to take the penalty and proceed to smash it past Buffon in the injury time.
</li></ul></li><li> The Euro 2004 semifinal between Greece and the Czech Republic finished 0-0 in 90 minutes. As a result, the game went into extra time, which, for this tournament, used the silver goal rule<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note122eja');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note122eja" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note122eja');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">if somebody was leading at half-time in extra time, they won</span>. At the end of the first half, Greece had a corner that was played into the box, before being headed into the goal by Traianos Dellas, which gave Greece the lead and a place in the Final that nobody had predicted a minute later.
</li><li> During the final match of their 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign, England needed at least a draw to qualify, but were 2-1 down going into stoppage time. Cue David Beckham <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2wpH09cOU4">doing what David Beckham does best<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. This goal had the added effect of <em>instantly</em> turning Beckham from one of England's most hated footballers (after his petulant red card at the previous World Cup) into one of its most beloved.
</li><li> In the 2003 Women's World Cup, Sweden took a 10 lead through Hanna Ljungberg late in the first half. Germany equalised just after the break thanks to Maren Meinert. Neither team scored again in regulation time, sending the match to extra time, which then operated under the golden goal rule (i.e. pure sudden death). Cue Germany's Nia Künzer ending the match and claiming the World Cup eight minutes in.
</li><li> During one group stage in the 2019 Women's World Cup, Cameroon and New Zealand played each other for the chance to get out of the group - since some third place teams were allowed out, either of them would advance if they won (and ended up with three points), while neither would advance if they tied and both had one point. The two teams were tied at the 90-minute mark and tied for nearly all of the few minutes of stoppage time, only for Cameroon to score in the literal last play before the final whistle was blown.
</li><li> A particularly dramatic case of this happened in the Brazilian second division in 2005, known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batalha_dos_Aflitos">"Battle of the Afflicted"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, due to both the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est&lt;!--C3--&gt;A1dio_dos_Aflitos">venue name<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and how it was tension all-around: Grêmio, a traditional team relegated shamefully the previous year, visited Náutico for the final game of a four-team group, top two receiving the promotion to the top level. At the 70th minute, Grêmio already one player down, receives a controversial penalty (the ball hit a defender's elbow) that leads to a second red card. The team surrounds the ref to complaining... and two are expelled, leaving Grêmio with the bare minimum of seven players. Chaos ensued, with the whole thing being interrupted for 25 minutes, meaning that if the game was restarted, there would hardly be any time for anything other than the penalty. And Náutico managed to have the kick saved, with Grêmio's counter-attack resulting in a goal that gave them the title!

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaOne">Formula One</a>. Lewis Hamilton won the 2008 championship from Felipe Massa on the last corner of the last lap of the last race. Going into the final race in Brazil, Hamilton held a seven-point lead in the drivers' championship over Massa, meaning that if Massa won he would need to finish fifth or higher to claim the title - a sixth place finish, and the resulting points tie, would give it to Massa by virtue of number of races won. After running wide on lap 69 as a result of a very wet track, Hamilton fell to sixth, where he stayed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=VsLX2Uen2dc#t=160s">as Massa crossed the line to take the race win<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. As the Ferrari pit crew and the crowds celebrated what they thought was Massa claiming the championship at his home race, Hamilton was still trying to fight his way past Sebastian Vettel to retake fifth, when— "Is that Glock? Is that Glock going slowly?" Timo Glock, who was still on worn-out dry tyres on the wet track, had slowed dramatically, and Hamilton passed him in the last corner, finished fifth and won the championship.
<ul><li> Tragically, the cameras caught Massa's family and mechanics <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlJWwuV9eBw">celebrating prematurely<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTheSet">One of the mechanics got quite angry</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2011 Canadian Grand Prix was the longest race in F1 history, as various stoppages for poor weather stretched its duration out to 4 hours, 4 minutes. Jenson Button, who had been last when the final stoppage occurred, put in an astonishing performance after the restart to climb his way up to second by the start of the final lap. With a few corners to go, and Button closing in, reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel made an uncharacteristic error and span wide, allowing Button through to win and seal one of the greatest performances of his entire career.
</li><li> The Indianapolis 500 lead has changed hands on the last lap on two occasions (shown below). Seven other races (1982, 1992, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2014, and 2015) were won by margins of less than a second (not counting victories under yellow).
<ul><li> 2006: Sam Hornish was in second behind Marco Andretti with two laps to go. On lap 199, Hornish tried to squeeze past Andretti in turn 3, but had to back off and lost nearly a full second. On the final lap, Hornish caught up (considering the laps take barely 40 seconds, a heck of a piece of driving by itself), then passed Andretti on the final straightaway about <strong>one second</strong> before crossing the finish line. Watch the clip <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GT9R8xwu6rY">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, and count the number of times the announcers say "Marco's gonna win this thing!". Marco Andretti's comment? "Second's nothing."
</li><li> 2011: Rookie driver JR Hildebrand inherited the lead on fuel strategy three laps from the end when cars ahead had to pit. He made it all the way to the last corner when he misjudged a pass on a slow lapped car, drifted wide into the wall and wiped the right side wheels off his car. As he slithered agonisingly towards the finish line he was passed by Dan Wheldon in the final few hundred metres. By tragic irony Hildebrand and Wheldon would be involved in a massive crash in the last race of the year; Hildebrand walked away unscathed but Wheldon died from head injuries. A further irony is that Wheldon only ran a part-time schedule that year, having lost his drive with the Panther Racing team - to Hildebrand.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans was the first time that the loophole-abusing Porsche 917 was entered, and throughout most of the race, the sheer speed of the Porsches was difficult to compete with. However, the untested cars were unreliable and attrition set in. The race was eventually contested between a fast prototype Porsche with failing brakes and the then-overweight and underpowered Ford GT 40 driven by the rookie, Jacky Ickx. The last hour of the race had the two cars swapping places constantly, and ended up with Ickx's GT 40 winning by a scant 120 metres after 24 hours of racing.
<ul><li> Le Mans final laps are usually parade laps as the winning car is often laps ahead by the finish. Other close finishes at Le Mans that have taken place at full speed include in 1983 when the two Rothmans Porsches were 17 seconds apart at the line. The lead car had a broken engine and it seized practically as it crossed the line to win. In 2011 the gap between the winning Audi R18 and 2nd placed Peugeot was 13.8 seconds, or about the length of the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apb49DI4Xs4">last few corners<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The 2016 race was all set to be Toyota's first victory... until their lead car broke down just after starting what would have been its final lap, and the second-placed Porsche 919 came screaming past with three minutes left on the race clock. The Toyota began to slow halfway round its penultimate lap with a turbocharger problem so unexpected that the driver of the other Toyota thought it was slowing up for a team photo-op at the finish. With a minute's lead over the Porsche the Toyota still made it to the line first so had the problem risen only a lap later they would have still won.
</li></ul></li><li> The 1976 Daytona 500 went into the last lap with Richard Petty and David Pearson running 1st and 2nd respectively. Pearson passed Petty for the lead on the backstretch, but as the two entered the 4th and final turn, Petty passed Pearson back. Approaching the finish line, the two cars made contact and both hit the retaining wall before spinning out onto the infield grass. Petty's damaged car ended up stalling a mere 150 feet from the finish line. As members of Petty's pit crew ran over to try and get him re-started, Pearson limped his equally-wrecked car past Petty and over the line for the victory. Both drivers had been so far ahead of the rest of the field that Petty was able to eventually re-start his car and, despite the delay, cross the finish ahead of the 3rd place driver for second place.
</li><li> Tony Stewart won the 2011 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NASCAR">NASCAR</a> Sprint Cup championship by 1.3 seconds in the last race of the year. Stewart won the race ahead of Carl Edwards second, tying the two on points with Stewart winning by virtue of having more wins in the year.
</li><li> Talladega Superspeedway is known for this in NASCAR, because the finish line is past the exit to pit road, unlike Daytona where the finish line is in the tri-oval. Numerous races there have been decided by a last lap pass in the tri-oval area.
</li><li> The 2011 British Superbike Championship came down to the last corner of the last lap between riders Tommy Hill and John Hopkins. The two riders battled nose-to-tail for the last two laps, the lead changed hands <em>six times</em> on the last lap and Hill beat Hopkins to the line and the title by 000.6 seconds. Needless to say it was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjePvNcu8n4">quite a finish<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Professional drag racing is all about this, particularly in the top tiers of high-powered nitro-fueled cars. Winning margins measured in hundredths or even <em>thousandths</em> of seconds are not uncommon.
</li><li> In MotoGP, one race had to be decided via a tiebreaker because the first two riders crossed the finish line in <a class="urllink" href="https://img.europapress.es/fotoweb/fotonoticia_20110717123040_640.jpg">a dead-heat<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>. Both Hector Faubel and Johann Zarco finished on the exact same time in the 125cc class race at the 2011 German motorcycle Grand Prix in Sachsenring, forcing the MotoGP officials to go to the tiebreakers and ultimately declared Faubel as the winner as he had set a laptime that is faster than Zarco during the race.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FormulaE">Formula E</a> race at Mexico City in 2019 came down to the wire as Pascal Wehrlein of Mahindra was running out of usable energy in his car whilst Lucas di Grassi's Audi was hot on his tails on the final lap. The race (which was timed for 45 minutes + 1 lap) had gone on for one lap longer than expected and that had already caught out both Nissan drivers, who ran out of juice on the final lap and led to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-KzZXXU1nw&amp;t=519s">some... colorful language rant in French<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by their driver Sébastien Buemi. Coming out of the final corner, Wehrlein's car ran out of usable energy and di Grassi took advantage of it by pulling his car to the right to win by just a few meters on the line.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder20');">    Baseball </div><div class="folder" id="folder20" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In baseball, since the teams take turns with the visitors batting in the top of the inning and the home team batting in the bottom, a Down To The Last Play moment can really only happen to the home team. This is often referred to as a "walkoff" - originally to signify the losing pitcher having to "walk off" the mound alone and (for the moment) unloved, but now the term is more focused on the home team (and their fans) walking off the field in celebration once the winning run scores.
</li><li> Ten World Series have ended in this way, with the home team winning the last game on a walkoff. However, four of those occurred before Game 7, so those Series would have continued if the road team had won that game. Six World Series have been won in true Down To The Last Play fashion, with the home team winning in the last at-bat of a winner-take-all final game:
<ul><li> In 1912, the Red Sox beat the New York Giants on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game <strong>8</strong>. Game 2 was called on account of darkness with the game tied.
</li><li> In 1924 the Washington Senators beat the New York Giants on an RBI double which bounced over the New York third baseman's head in the bottom of the 12th inning.
</li><li> Possibly the most famous example is the 1960 World Series, which was the first World Series to end with a true Down To The Last Play home run. Bill Mazeroski's homer on the second pitch in the bottom of the 9th gave the Pittsburgh Pirates a victory over the New York Yankees.
</li><li> In 1991 Gene Larkin's single in the 10th won the Series for the Minnesota Twins over the Atlanta Braves.
</li><li> In 1997 Edgar Rentería's single in the 11th won the Series for the Florida Marlins<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note13cvgj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note13cvgj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note13cvgj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">now Miami Marlins</span> over the Cleveland Indians.
</li><li> In 2001 the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Yankees in the bottom of the 9th when Luis Gonzalez floated a pop fly over Derek Jeter's head and into short left field.
</li><li> In Game 7 of 2014, the Kansas City Royals had Alex Gordon on 3rd as the tying run in the bottom of the 9th. A phenomenal Series-long performance by Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner was arguably all that stopped Kansas City, as it ended in a foul-out by Salvador Perez.
</li></ul></li><li> However, all six of the World Series victories listed above came with the game tied before the last play, so in each of them the game would have continued if the batter had made an out. In fact, in the history of baseball's postseason dating back to 1903, only one postseason series has truly come Down To The Last Playa hit by the home team, in the bottom of the last inning of the decisive game, with the home team trailing with two outs, which turned defeat into victory. That was the 1992 National League Championship Series between the Atlanta Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates, in which Francisco Cabrera of the Braves drove a single to left in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 7, scoring two runs, winning the game 32 and winning the series 43.
</li><li> If you expand Down To The Last Play to include games where the comeback <em>fails</em>, where the home team has a chance to win at the end but does not, this section would be longer. One famous example is the 1962 World Series. The Yankees were clinging to a 10 lead over the San Francisco Giants in the bottom of the ninth of Game 7 when Matty Alou led off with a single. Next came two outs and then Willie Mays' double into the right field corner, giving the Giants runners at second and third. The next batter, Willie McCovey, hit a screaming line driveright to Yankee Bobby Richardson at second, who caught it to win the game and the Series.
<ul><li> This was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> for the next several months in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts">Peanuts</a></em> where Charlie Brown would shout "Why couldn't McCovey have hit the ball 3 feet higher?" (or even one foot)
</li></ul></li><li> Many individual games, of course, have been won in Down to the Last Play moments. Some notable examples are listed below.
</li><li> The only World Series besides 1960 to end on a home run was in 1993. Toronto won four games to two when Joe Carter's three-run homer in the bottom of the 9th won Game 6 86.
<div class="indent"> <strong>Blue Jays radio announcer Tom Cheek:</strong> <strong>Touch 'em all, Joe!</strong> You'll never hit a bigger home run in your life!
</div></li><li> In the 1986 World Series the Boston Red Sox, leading the Series three games to two, led 53 going to the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 6, and were three outs from a championship. The first two New York Met batters made quick outs. The Shea Stadium scoreboard operator prematurely flashed the message <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssumedWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssumedWin">"Congratulations World Champion Boston Red Sox"</a>. Then <em>everything</em> fell apart. Three straight singles cut it to a one-run game and put the tying run at third. A new reliever was brought in, and a wild pitch allowed the tying run to score and the winning run to advance to second. Then, an infamous error, as veteran Boston first baseman Bill Buckner let the ball get past him, allowing the winning run to score. The Mets then won Game 7<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note14qjg0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note14qjg0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note14qjg0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the Mets fell behind 30, then came back after the scoreboard operator replayed Buckner's Game 6 error</span> and the championship.
<ul><li> However, even in that game, the error came after the game had already been tied. The only time in postseason history that an error <em>directly</em> led to a team losing a game that they would have won right then and there if the play had been made came in 2009, when with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning in game 2 of the NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals, the Cardinals ahead 21, Cardinals left fielder Matt Holliday dropped a line drive off the bat of James Loney, allowing the inning to continue. The Dodgers went on to score twice in the inning and won the game, eventually sweeping the series.
<ul><li> This was not the first time that Holliday had been involved in such a moment. In 2007, he was a member of the Colorado Rockies, who had been buried deep in the NL wild card standings <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally">when they went on an 11-game winning streak</a>, but when that streak was snapped in the third-to-last game of the season, they found themselves two games back with two left to play, needing to win both of their last two games and have San Diego lose both of their last two just to have a chance at a one-game playoff. (The New York Mets were also tied with the Rockies and were just one game back in <em>their</em> division, so the tiebreakers had the potential to get even <em>more</em> complicated.) San Diego entered the ninth inning of their penultimate game ahead 32, but with two outs and two strikes, Tony Gwynn Jr.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note15eutu');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note15eutu" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note15eutu');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">whose father played his entire <em>Hall of Fame</em> career as a member of the Padres, making this even more painful for San Diego fans</span> hit a game-tying triple for the Milwaukee Brewers, who won the game in 11 innings (a walk-off) to give the Rockies life. The Rockies would end up winning their last two and the Brewers beat the Padres again the next day, setting up a one-game playoff in Colorado that was tied at 6 at the end of nine innings. San Diego scored two runs in the top of the 13th, but Colorado led off with two straight doubles, followed by Holliday hitting a game-tying triple and then scoring on a sacrifice fly in which he may not have ever actually touched home plate. Just to add to the madness, statistics compiled in one-game playoffs are counted as regular season statistics. Holliday's game-tying hit was his second RBI of Game 163, giving him a total of 137 on the season—one more than Philadelphia's Ryan Howard, whose 136 led the National League through 162 games.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Kirk Gibson of the Los Angeles Dodgers, who was dealing with injuries to both legs that caused him to limp visibly as he walked to the plate, hit a two-run homer—on a three-ball, two-strike count with two outs—in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series to beat the Oakland A's 54. The victory propelled the underdog Dodgers to a shocking five-game victory over the heavily favored Athletics.

</div></li><li> The New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers played a special three-game tiebreaker for the 1951 National League championship after finishing the season with identical 9658 records. In the bottom of the ninth of the third game, trailing 42, Bobby Thomson hit a three-run homer off of Ralph Branca to win the NL pennant. Thomson's homer is remembered to this day as <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_Heard_%27Round_the_World_%28baseball%29">The Shot Heard 'Round the World<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Fifty-three years later, in the 2014 National League Championship Series, Travis Ishikawa hit a 3-run walk-off home run to lift the Giants (now in San Francisco) over the St. Louis Cardinals and send the Giants to their third World Series in five years.
</li></ul></li><li> One of the weirdest Down to the Last Play moments in history was <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle%27s_Boner">Merkle's Boner<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaveAGayOldTime">ha ha ha, stop laughing</a>), which happened on September 23, 1908. The Giants should have beaten the Cubs on a walkoff single in the bottom of the ninth inning, but Fred Merkle, who was on first base, failed to advance to second. The Cubs retrieved the ball, which may or may not have gone into the stands, and threw to second base for a force out of Merkle. The game was called on account of darkness immediately after. Naturally, this proved crucial, as the Cubs and Giants wound up tied for first place and the game had to be replayed. The Cubs beat the Giants in the makeup game and won the pennant.
<ul><li> The entire story of that play was that the rule that the Cubs enforced was traditionally <em>not</em> enforced at the end of games back in those days, due to fans normally storming the field after such a walkoff. The Cubs themselves tried the same trick a few weeks before, only to have the umpire say that he did not recall whether the runner had touched second and thus the walkoff stood. The ump promised the Cubs he'd watch and call it the next time he saw it...which happened to be the Merkle game.
</li></ul></li><li> Game 6 of the 2011 World Series provided several remarkable moments.
<ul><li> The Texas Rangers, seeking their first championship in forty years of existence (fifty if you count their previous 10 years as the Washington Senators), led the St. Louis Cardinals three games to two, and led 75 in the bottom of the ninth inning. With two outs and two runners on base, David Freese fell behind the count 12, leaving the Rangers one strike away from victory and a championship. Freese hit the ball over Nelson Cruz's head and off the right-field wall for a two-run triple to tie the game at 7.
</li><li> After Yadier Molina flied out to end the ninth, the Rangers proceeded to take a 97 lead in the top of the 10th on a homer by Josh Hamilton. The Cardinals came up in the bottom of the 10th and went single, single, sac bunt to advance the runners, and RBI groundout to make the score 98 with two outs. Lance Berkman batted next and fell behind the count 12, leaving the Rangers <strong>again</strong> one strike away from victory and a championship. After the next pitch was a ball, Berkman lined a single to center field, again tying the game, this time at 9.
</li><li> Finally, after the Rangers failed to score in the top of the 11th, Freese had his second hero moment in three innings, leading off the bottom of the 11th with a home run to center that won the game 10-9. The Cardinals won Game 7 and the championship the next day.
</li></ul></li><li> June 23, 1984: Bottom of the 9th, 2 outs, The Chicago Cubs were trailing the St. Louis Cardinals, their hated rivals, 98 and Bruce Sutter, the best closer in the game at the time and a future Hall of Famer, was on the mound. Up walks another future Hall of Famer, Ryne Sandberg, who proceeded to drive a home run off Sutter to tie it at 9. In the 10th, the Cardinals would score twice to make it 119; the Cubs were able to get a runner on base, but were once again down to their final out when up walked Sandberg again, again to face Sutter... and again he saved the Cubs by driving a two-run homer into the bleachers. The Cubs won the game in 11 and cement their claim to be contenders in 1984 after being known as "Lovable Losers" for decades beforehand.
</li><li> The 2016 World Series not only went to Game 7, it went to extra innings, along with a rain delay right after the ninth inning ended, just to add to the drama. However, it also averted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryYearTheyFizzleOut">Every Year They Fizzle Out</a> for the Chicago Cubs, who won the game 8-7 in the 10th inning, ending a 108-year-long drought between World Series titles.
</li><li> On July 27, 2017, Toronto Blue Jays batter Steve Pearce pulled off a walk-off grand slam in the bottom of the 10th to beat the Oakland Athletics 8-4. However, just 3 days later against the Angels, Pearce proceeded to do so <em>again</em> in the 9th for an 11-10 victory (also notably an "ultimate" grand slam, since it eliminated the entire deficit). He is only one of three batters in MLB history to have hit two walk-off grand slams in a single season.
</li><li> In a no-US example, during a quarterfinals match up at the 2018 Japanese High School Baseball Championship or the Summer Koshien, the biggest competition in Japanese sports, Omi Brotherhood High School clung onto a 2-1 lead heading into the bottom of the ninth, Kanaashi Nogyo High School loaded the bases with no outs, and won the game on a 2-run suicide squeeze. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Kanaashi Nogyo would eventually make it all the way to the finals, becoming the first team in over 100 years from Akita Prefecture to make the finals. The previous time a team from Akita reached the finals? 1915, the first year of Koshien.</span>

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder21');">    Basketball </div><div class="folder" id="folder21" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Basketball lends itself to these moments quite often; it is common for a team to go from defeat to victory on the last shot.
</li><li> In what may be the most shining example, the 1983 NC State Wolfpack's improbable run that earned them the nickname "Cardiac Pack".<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note162k4o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note162k4o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note162k4o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Because they put fans into cardiac arrest before finally winning.</span> Ranked 5th in the ACC (which consisted of 9 teams at the time), they had to win the conference tournament to even <em>qualify</em> for the NCAAs. They proceeded to win against Duke 7170 on free throws with time expired. Forced double overtime on last-second shots each time against North Carolina before finally winning 9184, and again on a last second shot against Virginia 8178. They then proceeded to the NCAA Championship game by winning 4 of their 5 games by 2 points or less. In the final game, they managed a 30-foot heave as time was running out, that was caught and dunked for a win as time ran out. This remains the only pre-64-team NCAA tournament image still shown as part of 'great moments' intros. Last second shots in 7 of 9 games to win a title!
</li><li> An infamous example is the basketball final at the 1972 Olympics. When the time expired, the USA had an 5049 lead against the Soviets. However, the referees added three seconds back to the clock on the direct order of the head of FIBA, who had no authority to do so (the FIBA head claimed the Soviets had attempted to call time out prior to the last free throw). After the Soviet shot failed, the referees added three MORE seconds back to the clock due to an error in restarting the clock. In this three seconds—on their third chance to win the game—a Soviet player scored, winning the team the gold medal. The Americans refused to accept the silver and filed a protest, but it was denied. It was the first loss <em>ever</em> for the US Olympic basketball team. To this day, the American players from that game still refuse to accept the silver medals, and at least one has left it in his will that his family can never accept the medal after he dies.
</li><li> A 2004 playoff game between the San Antonio Spurs and the Los Angeles Lakers, who had combined to win the last 5 titles and had each swept the other out of the way during that time, contained two improbable last-second shots. First the Spurs, trailing by a point with 5.4 seconds left, tried a handoff screen from Tim Duncan to Manu Ginóbili. Ginóbili was cut off from receiving the ball, so Duncan just had to just turn around, take a quick dribble, and throw the ball up from the top of the key. He was way off balance and actually fell on his back yet somehow the shot swished through. Now the Lakers had to score in 0.4 seconds or lose. Derek Fisher, who received the inbounds pass, had to grab it, spin around in mid-air, and shoot, all in one quick motion, because the clock starts the instant it touches any player. It also went right through the net, giving LA the game and a 32 series lead, cementing Fisher's reputation as one of the best clutch shooters ever, and leaving Duncan's shot as one of the best all-time clutch plays that didn't result in a win. As Shaq said, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSnAvhvfniw">"One lucky shot deserves another."<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JawDrop">Jaw Drop</a>.

</li><li> In Game 5 of the 1987 NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and Detroit Pistons all Detroit had to do was inbound the ball to win. But Boston forward Larry Bird stole the pass and while falling out-of-bounds passed to guard Dennis Johnson for the game-winning layup with one second left.
</li><li> The University of Virginia Cavaliers tend to do this a lot. There's a reason fans sometimes call them "Cardiac Cavs":
<ul><li> vs. Duke, 2001: The Blue Devils tried to inbound with 9 tenths left to play this trope straight, but <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPf3sAtJfw8">a steal by Adam Hall subverted it.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

The Cavaliers' Malcolm Brogdon made a basket with seconds left... enough seconds for Duke's Grayson Allen to make his own buzzer-beater. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsZstyQQ0Uw">It may have been a travel<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, but it counted, and Duke won.
</li><li> You think Wake Forest in 2016 is Up to Eleven? That's nothing compared to March 1, 2018 at Louisville. Virginia had erased most of a 13-point second-half deficit, but was still down 6662 to the Cardinals with Ty Jerome set to shoot three free throws, having been fouled on a three-point attempt... with <em>9 tenths left</em>. What happens from there?
<ul><li> Jerome hit his first two free throws, then deliberately missed the third. However... the Cavaliers were called for a lane violation, giving Louisville the ball behind its own basket.
</li><li> The Cardinals' Deng Adel tried to inbound, but apparently forgot a basic basketball rule and ran the baseline for a traveling violation.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1kuf7');"><sup>The rule </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1kuf7" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1kuf7');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The only time a player making an inbounds pass is allowed to move from his spot is after a <em>made</em> basket or free throw.</span> That gave the Cavaliers the ball under Louisville's basket, with the same 9 tenths left.
</li><li> Which was enough time for De'Andre Hunter to catch the inbounds pass and put up a three... that went in off the backboard, giving the Cavs an utterly improbable 6766 win.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In a 2010 game between Georgia Tech and Maryland, Georgia Tech scores the go-ahead basket with 3 seconds left on the clock. Maryland star PG Greivis Vásquez drives it down the court and makes what appears to be the game-winning basket from half-court, only for it to be called back because Maryland coach Gary Williams called a timeout with 1.5 seconds left. The game looks all-but-squandered until the ball gets inbounded to Maryland's Cliff Tucker, who promptly hits the game-winning shot.
</li><li> Maccabi Tel Aviv has more than one example of this, but probably the most memorable one is the "algiris Miracle": Maccabi Tel Aviv vs. algiris Kaunas, the last game in group G of the 2003/4 Euroleague Top 16, which ended up being the game that decides which team wins the group and qualify to the Final 4. With algiris leading by 5 points with only a few seconds left on the clock, it seemed to be all over for Maccabi. Maccabi scored a quick 2 pointer and made a desperate foul on one of algiris players. Not only does the player miss both free throws, but one of algiris players entered the key too early, stopping the clock and giving Maccabi the ball with 2 seconds remaining. Then <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxq41-rsEv0">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> happens, sending the game into overtime and giving Maccabi a huge morale boost, with which they proceed to win the game and eventually, the Euroleague title.

In overtime, Eastview scored with 2.5 seconds left to go up 2. Hopkins threw the ball the length of the court. One of their players, Blake Hoffarber, fell on the floor, the ball bounced his way, and he grabbed the ball and threw it at the basket, <em>while sitting down on the floor</em>. It went in to tie the game. It <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJoxGpEswOI">has to be seen to be believed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Eric Gordon was at the line with a chance to tie it. He missed the first and intentionally missed the second. Indiana got the rebound. D.J. White was fouled on the putback with 3.1 seconds left and had a chance to give Indiana the lead, but he missed the free throw. He then got fouled <em>again</em> on the rebound with 1.5 seconds left. He split the pair to make it 5857 Indiana. After a timeout, Travis Busch <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u51znupszPw&amp;t=35s">threw a baseball pass<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> almost the length of the court.

Vanderbilt's Barry Goheen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl3t7HLZMZ4&amp;t=27s">hit a 3 with 5 seconds left<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to make it 6766 after Pittsburgh's Jason Matthews hit two free throws with 12 seconds left. After Charles Smith hit two free throws with 4 seconds left, Goheen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl3t7HLZMZ4&amp;t=3m9s">took the ball upcourt<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, then hit a 3 at the buzzer to force OT. Vanderbilt won 8074 to advance to the Sweet 16.
</li><li> In the 2013 New York state Section 1 Class AA high school championships, with Mount Vernon leading New Rochelle 6058, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-rsGQ5JNqA">Khalil Edney's in-bounds pass with 2.9 seconds left<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is intercepted by a Mount Vernon player, who heaves the ball up into the air to kill the clock—only it comes down in Edney's hands with enough time for him to toss up a half-court shot, which goes in and, after a lengthy video review, is ultimately counted, giving New Rochelle the 6160 win.
</li><li> In 2014's NCAA Division III playoffs, The University of Texas at Dallas Comets hosted the regional for their division. The final of said regional pitted them up against Whitworth, a school from Washington state. The game went to overtime off of a Whitworth basket to close out regulation, and UTD fell behind by seven early in the overtime. They came roaring back thanks to good free throw shooting and poor free throws by Whitworth, making it 7775 with 9.6 seconds left to play. UTD fouled the inbounder, stopping the clock with 7.1 left and forcing a one-and-one free throw, which was missed. With the final 7.1 seconds, UTD dribbled the ball upcourt, and then put up a shot at 0.4 seconds left. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVv_UMwGBNU">The last 9.6 seconds of clock time can be seen here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Colonial Athletic Association men's semifinals, William &amp; Mary vs. Hofstra, March 8, 2015. The game went to double overtime, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">there were three "last plays"</a>. Eventually, W&amp;M's Dixon hit a three-pointer to win. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShQq1WDgVGo">The highlights are here.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> The Villanova Wildcats defeated the North Carolina Tar Heels to win the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I championship with, for the first time in tournament history, a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-CDHXaATcc">3-point buzzer beater<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. On the North Carolina "Team Stream" broadcast of the game being broadcast by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TNT">TNT</a>, the commentators almost immediately fell silent, stunned by the last-second victory.
</li><li> The 2018 Division I Women's Final Four featured not one, not two, but <em>all three</em> games featuring this trope. In the first semifinal, the always-dominant UConn Huskies managed to force overtime after trailing by five with just 21 seconds left after Kia Nurse stole the ball and scored the game-tying layup with 10 seconds left (though they actually forced another turnover and couldn't get the game-winner in regulation), but Notre Dame's Arike Ogunbowale broke a tie in the closing seconds of overtime to dispatch the undefeated Huskies. The second semifinal was just as intense, with Louisville scoring to take a 3-point lead with 11 seconds left, Mississippi State tying it up with 6 left, and Louisville putting up a potential buzzer-beater that didn't fall; sadly, the overtime wasn't quite so intense, with State handily beating the Cardinals. The championship game was the only game of the Final Four to end in regulation... with <em>another</em> buzzer-beater by Ogunbowale, this time from 3-point range, giving the Fighting Irish the title.
</li><li> In Game 7 of the 2019 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals between the Toronto Raptors and the Philadelphia 76ers, Kawhi Leonard received an inbounds pass from Marc Gasol with 4.2 seconds on the clock and a 90-90 tie. Then, while defended by Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons he launched a fadeaway buzzer beater which bounced on the rim <em>4 times</em> before going in to become the first Game 7 game-winning buzzer-beater in NBA history. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">usually reserved</a> Kawhi roared in celebration, Embiid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears">broke down in tears</a> while walking to the locker room and the Raps would go on to face the Milwaukee Bucks in the East Finals. For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatAsBackstory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatAsBackstory">added drama points</a> 18 years earlier, Raptors legend Vince Carter shot from the <em>very same spot</em> (off-balance jumper from the short corner), in the <em>very same situation</em> (Game 7 of the East Semifinals against the Sixers) and missed, which allowed the Allen Iverson-led Sixers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals... and face the Bucks. And the Raps would also beat Milwaukee and go to the Finals against a juggernaut, star-studded, heavily favored team from the West Coast (Lakers in 2001, Warriors in 2019). Unlike Philly, however, Toronto managed to snatch the "chip" from the Golden State Goliath in 6 games, their first in franchise history. If it were an ending of a sports movie, critics would call it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">cliched and contrived</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> Real life is stranger than fiction example. Boise State University, a huge underdog to the perennial-powerhouse Oklahoma Sooners, won the 2007 Fiesta Bowl by scoring on three trick plays on the last play of the game and in overtime. The touchdown scoring ones (a hook and ladder, and a halfback pass) and the final 2-point conversion to win in overtime (a Statue of Liberty play) were all well-known trick plays that fail more often than they succeed. To add to the theatrical quality, the player who made the winning score popped the question to his cheerleader girlfriend after the game (on national TV). She said yes.
</li><li> American Football has had plenty over the years... but one stands head and shoulders above all others in terms of sheer insanity. It is known, even to Wikipedia, simply as "The Play". In 1982, college football teams representing arch-rivals California<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note176ghf');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note176ghf" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note176ghf');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">the flagship campus in Berkeley, to be specific - nine of the ten undergraduate campuses of the University of California system run their own NCAA-affiliated programs (UC Merced was founded in 2005 and is a part of the NAIA) </span> and Stanford played their season-ending game. After a spectacular drive led by John Elway, Stanford took a 2019 lead on a field goal with four seconds left, meaning Cal had to return the ensuing kickoff all the way or they'd lose (theoretically, they could down it promptly and try for a Hail Mary, but that's much more difficult). In the equivalent of a rugby play, Cal used five laterals to keep the play alive until they ran it into the end zone and scored a touchdown. Bonus points because the Stanford band and team thought they had <em>already won</em>, and were filing onto the field  at one point, they were at least 20 yards downfield  for their victory tune  and a band member got clobbered in the process. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fZCCAqoSwY">It has to be seen to be believed, really.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (One of the passes may have been thrown after the player was already down by contact, and so Stanford to this day refuses to acknowledge the game as a Cal win.)
</li><li> Also older, and a rare example of both sides of the trope showing up: 1994 Texas HS football: Plano East pulls off a near-impossible 24-point comeback with three minutes left in the fourth quarter. With only seconds on the clock and only the final kickoff to perform, John Tyler High takes the kickoff right back up the field, pulling off the Miracle Win/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Downer Ending</a> combo. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHkABO0VwCg">The play-by-play is almost as entertaining, for different reasons.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In October 2007, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CollegiateAmericanFootball">Trinity University football team</a> recovered from a two-point deficit with two seconds remaining in one play, to win the game 2824. They moved the ball sixty yards to reach the end zone, and they only needed <em>15</em> laterals to pull it off.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> XXXIV, the favored St. Louis Rams took a 2316 lead just after the two minute warning in the fourth quarter. The underdog Tennessee Titans started their final drive of regulation at their own 10 yard line in an attempt to tie the game and force the first ever Super Bowl overtime. The Titans manage to move the ball 80 yards in 1:48. On the Rams' 10 yard line with time for one last play, Titans QB Steve McNair completed a pass to wide receiver Kevin Dyson, who was wide open and set to make the game-tying touchdown. At the last moment, Rams linebacker Mike Jones ran towards Dyson, grabbed him by the legs and dragged Dyson to the ground. Dyson stretched the ball out in an attempt to reach the goal line (the rule states that only the ball has to cross the plane of the goal line for a touchdown), but the ball stopped only a few inches shy of the goal line and time expired. So, after an 80 yard, 1:48 rally, the Titans fell inches shy of tying the game and the Rams won the Super Bowl 2316.
</li><li> In the 2009 Grey Cup (final of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianFootballLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CanadianFootballLeague">Canadian Football League</a>) game, the Montreal Alouettes were down 2725, 43 yards from the Saskatchewan Roughriders' goal when time ran out (and this was, indeed, after a comeback from 2711 early in the fourth quarter). A 43-yard field goal attempt fell short, but Saskatchewan would receive a 10-yard penalty for having 13 men on the field, and Montreal got to try again. The 33-yard attempt was successful, and Montreal won 2827. Actually, it's even more clever. The Alouettes knew the Roughriders had one too many players, and they went in as fast as possible and rushed their kick before the other team realised they were in fault. It was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit">Xanatos Gambit</a>: Either they scored and won, or they missed, called the penalty, and got to try again much closer.
</li><li> During the 2010 CFL season in a Week 18 matchup, the Alouettes were tied with the Toronto Argonauts 30-30 with 9 seconds left in regulation. Either a successful field goal OR Toronto failing to get the ball out of their end zone should the field goal attempt go wide, scoring a single, would give Montreal the win, otherwise the game would go into overtime. Montreal's field goal attempt does go wide, Toronto kicks the ball out of the back of their end zone, Montreal receives the punt at Toronto's 22-yard line, then punts it back into Toronto's end zone, Toronto tries to kick the ball back out of their end zone while it's on the ground, however, Montreal swats the ball near the goal line and recovers the fumble for the game-winning touchdown. This <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5BFaykcxGg">video<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> breaks down what happens.
</li><li> The 2010 Music City Bowl between North Carolina and Tennessee had a similar last-second gambit to the aforementioned Grey Cup incident, except a bit more awkward. Trailing 2017 in the 4th, a North Carolina field goal would send the game to overtime. In the dying seconds, the Tar Heels sloppily rushed a field goal unit with <em>way</em> too many players onto the field, and T.J. Yates spiked the ball with only one second left. The point of the play was to stop the clock on the ensuing penalty (since Yates had spiked the ball before time ran out), in order to get one more chance for an <em>actual</em> field goal attempt. Confusion ensued when time ran out: a flag was thrown, but the referee declared the game over, and the Volunteers began storming the field in celebration. Eventually, the officials clicked into the Tar Heels' ruse, giving them a 10-yard penalty and putting a single second back on the clock. North Carolina got their field goal, and won the game 3027 in double overtime.
<ul><li> The incident led to an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObviousRulePatch">Obvious Rule Patch</a> by the NCAA in subsequent seasons; in 2011, the rules were changed so that 10 seconds must run from the clock if a foul which stops it is assessed (or a timeout can be taken).
</li></ul></li><li> The tendency to seemingly always <em>lose</em> in these types of situations tends to mark whole franchises as being cursed. The aforementioned Red Sox were the poster children here. As are the Buffalo Bills for things like Scott Norwood missing the potential game-winning field goal in Super Bowl XXV for the Bills to lose 2019, and losing by way of the infamous "Music City Miracle" against Tennessee. Cleveland also has been similarly victimized across the sports spectrum. The Browns' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNaymeIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyNaymeIs">Earnest</a> Byner fumbling at the 2-yard line on a potential game-tying score late in the 4th quarter against the Denver Broncos, the Cleveland Cavaliers being victimized by Michael Jordan with <em>The Shot</em> over Craig Ehlo, and the Bulls blocking Charles Smith's possible game-winning layups 4 straight times at the very end of Game 5 in the 1993 Eastern Conference Finals against the Knicks, it can drive a fanbase insane. Especially with Norwood, who had been clutch all year, and Byner, who was having the game of his life, the moments are even more gut-wrenching because they were two guys expected to come up big when it counts. Just like <em>Casey at the Bat</em>.
</li><li> Another example in which the Buffalo Bills were a victim came near the end of the 1999 AFC wild-card game against the Tennessee Titans in what became known as "The Music City Miracle". With seconds left, Steve Christie hit a 41-yard field goal to put Buffalo up 1615. Then came the kickoff, which was a squib kick first fielded by fullback Lorenzo Neal, who handed the ball to tight end Frank Wycheck. Wycheck then threw a controversial lateral to receiver Kevin Dyson, who took the ball 75 yards for a touchdown (which was confirmed after instant replay showed that Wycheck had not thrown an illegal forward pass), resulting in a 2216 win that led to the Titans march to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SuperBowl">Super Bowl</a> XXXIV (as well as providing a measure of revenge for several older players who were members of the team when they were known as the Houston Oilers and lost the 1992 wild-card 4138 to Buffalo after leading <em><strong>353</strong></em>). The Bills did not appear in the postseason again until 2017, and with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MLBTeams">Toronto Blue Jays</a> making it to the ALCS in 2015, the Bills had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedalOfDishonor">the longest active playoff drought of any team in the "big four" North American sports leagues</a> until 2017 (the Seattle Mariners now hold that record).
</li><li> In the 1998 NFC Championship Game between the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Falcons. Late in the game, Vikings ahead by 7, they bring out Gary Anderson, the only kicker to make every field goal and extra point during the regular season. But he missed a routine 38-yard field goal wide left, allowing the Falcons to get a touchdown to tie the game in the final 2:07. Atlanta promptly won in overtime.
</li><li> In week 15 of the 2009 NFL season, the Pittsburgh Steelers trailed the Green Bay Packers 3630 and faced a 3rd-&amp;-10 at the Green Bay 19-yard line with three seconds remaining. Ben Roethlisberger dropped back and fired a pass toward the sideline, and Mike Wallace made a falling catch in the end zone to tie the game as time expired. The play stood as a touchdown after an official review, and Jeff Reed kicked the extra point to give the Steelers a 3736 win.
</li><li> 2007 Arena Football playoff game between the Chicago Rush and Colorado Crush. (Apparently the Arena League had never heard of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneSteveLimit">One Steve Limit</a>, as these two teams were even in the same division.) Colorado (the home team) had a three-point lead, but was forced to make a goal-line stand against Chicago on the final play. Colorado made an apparent game-winning interception, the confetti was dropped from the rafters...only to discover that a penalty had been called on the play (for holding the intended receiver of the pass), forcing a do-over. Chicago then went for a game-tying field goal, made it, and forced overtime...the start of which was delayed by over <em>15 minutes</em> to clear all of the confetti from the field. Fortunately for the Crush, they won in OT anyway.
</li><li> In Super Bowl XLVI (2012), the New England Patriots were down by 4 points with 5 seconds left on the clock. Tom Brady attempted to throw a Hail Mary pass in the end zone, but it was broken up.
<ul><li> Relatedly, the Patriots got into the Super Bowl when the Baltimore Ravens missed a fairly easy 32-yard field goal on the final play, a field goal that would have otherwise tied the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Say what you will about Tim Couch of the Cleveland Browns; he was able to have two awesome moments in his otherwise lackluster career, both on Hail Marys. On October 31, 1999, he hit Kevin Johnson on a 56-yard bomb to beat the New Orleans Saints for the expansion Browns' first win. Then, on December 8, 2002, he found Quincy Morgan on a 50-yard catch to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars (nearly a year after the infamous "Bottlegate" game against the Jags). To date, Couch is the only quarterback to win more than one NFL game on the final play of regulation with passes of 50 or more yards.
</li><li> In the "River City Relay" game from 2003, the New Orleans Saints trailed the Jacksonville Jaguars 2013 with 7 seconds left, but in a play involving multiple spur-of-the-moment laterals, scored a TD with no time remaining. But the game didn't go to overtime because the Saints <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ZBT3BWaj4">missed the extra point<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> - making this one of the most anticlimactic last-second finishes of all time.
</li><li> The infamous "Fail Mary" at the end of the 2012 Monday Night tilt between the Green Bay Packers and Seattle Seahawks. With the game being officiated by replacements due to the regular officials being locked out by the league, Seahawks QB Russell Wilson launched a desperation pass into the end zone that was grabbed by both Seahawks receiver Golden Tate and Packers defensive back M.D. Jennings. Although Jennings had two hands on the ball, and Tate had only one, the rules treat possession of the ball as something you either have or you don't. There is no such thing as having "more" possession than someone else. After a bit of confusion, the referees awarded a touchdown, as simultaneous possession means the ball belongs to the offense. Despite the rules stating that simultaneous possession was non-reviewable, the officials attempted to review the play, but did not see enough to overturn it. Beyond the confusion as to simultaneous possession rules, there was some controvercy over a potential missed penalty, as some observers believe Tate committed offensive pass interference on the play. The ensuing controversy caused so many fans to call the NFL commissioner's office that the line was disconnected, and the regular officials were brought back the following week.
</li><li> The Minnesota Vikings went into the last week of the 2003 season needing a victory over the 312 Arizona Cardinals to win their division. They were up 1712 with two minutes left, but the Cardinals recovered an onside kick. QB Josh McCown drove down the field and completed a miraculous 27-yard touchdown pass to Nathan Poole. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNwv4GUD8aA">With no time left.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> On <em>4th and 24</em>. The upset loss knocked the Vikings out of the playoffs.
</li><li> In 2013, after an embarrassing 3-9 season last year (with no wins against SEC opponents, including a 49-0 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">Curb-Stomp Battle</a> at the Iron Bowl — their traditional, season-ending cross-state rivalry with Alabama), the Auburn Tigers were experiencing a resurgence. One of their most notable comebacks came on November 16, 2013 — hosting another traditional rival, the Georgia Bulldogs. In the final 40 seconds, Georgia was leading 38-37. But then, Auburn QB Nick Marshall threw a 73-yard Hail Mary, which got a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_8tl0Q2pQg">lucky bounce<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> off two Georgia defensemen into the hands of their wide receiver, who took it the rest of the way for a game-winning touchdown. The "Prayer at JordanHare" was shaping up to be the most iconic moment of Auburn's 2013 season...
</li><li> ...until two weeks later at the Iron Bowl. Alabama had entered the season as two-time national champions, and were in their traditional form throughout. Going into the Iron Bowl, Alabama and Auburn were ranked at #1 and #4 in the nation respectively; for the first time ever, the winner of the game would clinch the SEC's west division and advance to the conference championship. Following an Auburn drive that scored a touchdown, tying the game at 28 with only 34 seconds left, Bama took over in their territory. Auburn stopped them from scoring and even forced a player out of bounds just as time expired, which stopped the clock. The play was reviewed, and one second was put back on the clock. Alabama attempted a 57-yard field goal. If it missed, the game would just go to overtime. Their starter had missed three earlier that game, so they put in the backup. He kicked the ball well, but it fell short, where Auburn returner Chris Davis waited. Davis then <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR7s2m5Z5GA">returned it all the way back to Alabama's end zone for a touchdown<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to win the game 3428, in what would later be known as the "Kick Six".
<ul><li> Auburn went on to win the SEC championship. Thanks to #10 Michigan State upsetting #2 Ohio State to take the Big Ten championship, Auburn got pushed up to #2 on the BCS rankings and played in the BCS Championship Game, where they lost to Florida State.
</li></ul></li><li> Alabama again, this time in 2018. The College Football Championship game against the Georgia Bulldogs. Real give-and-take thriller, especially at the end, tied 20-20. Alabama's Andy Pappanastos lines up to kick for the championships. He <em>slips</em>... and the kick goes <em>wide</em>, meaning the game goes into Overtime. Georgia gets the ball first and despite setbacks, takes the lead with a 51-yard field goal from Rodrigo Blankenship. Alabama's turn, and now they <em>must</em> score. First play, freshman quarterback Tua Tagovailoa gets sacked bad. But, <em>next play</em>, he finds Devonta Smith and connects for the Championship-winning touchdown!
</li><li> Super Bowl XLIX (2015) ended with the Seattle Seahawks trailing the New England Patriots 2824 during the final two minutes of the game, needing a touchdown in order to win the game. Quarterback Russell Wilson started the drive by completing a 33-yard pass to Marshawn Lynch. Then after another 11-yard first down, Wilson threw a long pass that was tipped by Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler, but ended up in the hands of wide receiver Jermaine Kearse who was lying on his back; Kearse somehow managed to keep the ball from hitting the ground, placing the Seahawks at the Patriots' 5 yard line with a real shot at winning the game. But after a Lynch 4-yard run put the ball on the 1, Wilson's pass to Ricardo Lockett with 20 seconds left was intercepted by Butler, deflating Seattle's hopes of winning. However, the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot">wasn't over just yet</a>, as the Pats were backed up in their own end zone, and Tom Brady didn't have enough room to take a knee without risking giving up a safety, which would've given the Hawks one more shot. However, Seattle's defense lost its discipline, incurring consecutive penalties which gave Brady more than enough room to run out the clock.
</li><li> A Monday Night Football game in 2000 between the Vikings and Packers ended in overtime in crazy fashion: Brett Favre heaved a 3rd down pass to Antonio Freeman, which appeared to drop incomplete... and then Freeman got up and ran with the ball into the end zone. Turns out that while Freeman had fallen down, the ball hit him a couple of times and never hit the ground; he plucked it out of the air and, never being touched down, got up and ran it into the end zone for the game-winning score.
</li><li> At the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBlgN85wB6U">2015 Michigan State vs. Michigan<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> football game, Michigan was up 2321 when they were set to punt the ball away with 10 seconds left on 4th and 2. Except the snap was fumbled and the ball went straight to MSU's Jalen Watts-Jackson, who ran it back for the game-winning touchdown as time expired. Not a bad way to beat your in-state rival for the 7th time in 8 years. A Grand Rapids news station was even caught off-guard by the ending, where a mix-up caused a sportscaster outside the stadium to <a class="urllink" href="http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/local-news-delivers-entire-report-on-michigan-beating-m-1737161749">report that Michigan had won<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The "<a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_at_the_Meadowlands">Miracle at the Meadowlands<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" involved the Philadelphia Eagles playing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRival">The Rival</a> New York Giants. Down 1712, the Eagles turned the ball over on downs deep in Giants territory, giving the Giants an apparent victory since all the Giants needed to do was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantWinCondition">run out the clock</a>. However, to do this required running one more play.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note18uvy0');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note18uvy0" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note18uvy0');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The play clock ran for 30 seconds up through the 1987 season, not 40; that's why New York needed to run another play; because if they took a knee on third down, there still would have been one second left in the game once the play clock ran down, requiring a play to be run on fourth down.</span> The Eagles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoNotGoGentle">were not content to give up</a> despite their seemingly hopeless situation. The Giants' offensive coordinator called a stock rush play to protect the QB from the Eagles, who ran a full-scale 11-man blitz to provoke a fumble. Instead, the play call <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">resulted in a fumble</a> that Eagles cornerback Herman Edwards promptly picked up and returned for the game winning touchdown. This result did two things; it immediately ended the career of that offensive coordinator, and it completely changed the way the final few plays of football are played with a special <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_kneel#Defense">victory formation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> designed to <em>specifically avoid another such "miracle"</em>.
<ul><li> 32 years later the Eagles and Giants <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_at_the_New_Meadowlands">met again in the Giants' new stadium<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Once again the Eagles appeared to be in a hopeless situation, down 3110 with only 8:17 left. However a series of quick scores left the game tied with only 14 seconds left and the Giants forced to punt the ball on 4th down. The punter, Matt Dodge, was instructed to punt the ball out of bounds to prevent Eagles return man DeSean Jackson, any chance to run the ball back for a touchdown. Unfortunately the punt did not go out of bounds and after initially bobbling the ball<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note19gefa');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note19gefa" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note19gefa');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">which had the effect of distracting the punt defense team</span>, Jackson ran it back for a touchdown. Since time expired well before Jackson entered the end zone, he because the first person in NFL history to score a walk-off punt return touchdown. Failure to kick the ball out of bounds ended the NFL career of Matt Dodge.
</li></ul></li><li> The 2016 Detroit Lions won a surprising number of games this way, sometimes literally at the last minute; one hopes that Lions fans aren't <a class="urllink" href="http://www.thedrawplay.com/comic/the-cardiac-cats-strike-again/">suffering from cardiac arrest as a result<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> The 2016 Cleveland Browns were about to finish the season 0-16, without any wins or ties. But a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasMiracle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristmasMiracle">Christmas Miracle</a> came in their second-to-last game against the then-San Diego Chargers on Christmas Eve. In the last seconds of the game, the Browns were leading 20-17, and the Chargers were attempting a field goal to force them into overtime. Instead, the Chargers missed it, and the Browns averted a winless season.
<ul><li> The 1980 Cleveland Browns were known as "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz">The Kardiac Kids</a>" for having several games decided by this trope.
</li></ul></li><li> Super Bowl LI:
<ul><li> Super Bowl LI (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOneWith">the one where</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveitDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveitDown">the Atlanta Falcons blew a 25-point lead</a>) was the first Super Bowl to go into overtime, which meant that due to the NFL's OT rules, the game came down to the last play by default, with the final play in question being <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axj4FVhkoL8">James White's 2 yard toss run.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Averted within regulation, as New England scored the tying touchdown and 2-point conversion with 57 seconds, though they did attempt a fake-kneel sweep that ultimately failed just as time expired.
</li><li> Incidentally, the <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/madden-nfl-america/0ap3000000781544/Madden-simulation-Who-wins-Super-Bowl-LI">official Madden simulation of Super Bowl LI<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> also had the Patriots winning over the Falcons in this fashion, scoring the game-winning touchdown on 4th and goal with the Patriots down 20-24 with 20 seconds left in regulation.
</li></ul></li><li> In the 2017-18 NFL Playoffs Divisional Round, the Minnesota Vikings took on the New Orleans Saints. The Saints were ahead by one point with 10 seconds left, neither team had a timeout, and the Vikings were about thirty yards outside of field-goal range. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJzpoj_NxqQ">Then this happened<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It was the first time in the Super Bowl era that a playoff game went down to the last play in regulation through a game-winning touchdown, and the play that won it had been known ever since as "The Minneapolis Miracle".
</li><li> The 1990 college game between the Minnesota Golden Gophers and the Utah Utes. The Utes had blown an early 19-0 lead and the game was tied 29-29 late in the fourth quarter. Minnesota blocked a Utah punt, and after a couple plays, with :08 remaining in the game<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note206hw4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note206hw4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note206hw4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">College football didn't have overtime back then</span>, Gopher kicker Brent Berglund was set to be the game's hero, once he made a sure-thing 29-yard field goal as time ran out. Instead, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn1mb_O6PT4">the Utes blocked the field goal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, then defensive back LaVon Edwards scooped up the ball and ran untouched to the end zone, giving Utah the 35-29 victory.
</li><li> In the 2019 NFL season, the San Francisco 49ers finished 13-3. Not only were all 3 losses against bird-themed teams, their division rival Seattle Seahawks, the Baltimore Ravens, and the Atlanta Falcons, but all 3 losses were thanks to last-second plays: the Seahawks kicked their game-winning field goal in the last seconds of overtime, the Ravens also won with a game-winning field goal, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNeedsOvertime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoNeedsOvertime">albeit before time expired in regulation</a>, and the Falcons scored a last-second touchdown.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder23');">    Other </div><div class="folder" id="folder23" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> A real life example occurred in the 2005 Ashes, specifically in the second Test. Australia were just two runs away from victory when Steve Harmison took the wicket of Mike Kasprowicz to level the series. It was almost universally hailed as the best Test match ever.
<ul><li> Arguably just as exciting was the third Test a week later where Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath (at that time the worst Test batsman in the world) managed to cling on for a draw to keep the series level. The real hero was Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who defied the England bowlers for seven hours before getting out with only four overs to go.
<ul><li> 2009, and the shoe's on the other foot as Monty Panesar and James Anderson hold out for <em>twelve</em> overs - nearly an hour's play. Panesar was a strong rival for McGrath's claim to be the world's worst batsman, and he held out much longer.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> The second ODI match between Australia and England in 2014 had Australia one wicket away from defeat, with 57 runs to make in order to win. James Faulkner, a bowling all-rounder, single-handedly carried the team over the line with three balls to spare.
</li><li> Another cricket example happened at the Adelaide Test between Australia and the West Indies in 1993. For the preceding 16 years, the West Indies were the top cricketers in the world - never losing a Test series for all of the 1980's to <em>anyone</em>. Going into the match, Australia only had to win one more to seal a series victory. The last two batsmen for Australia were one run from winning the series outright ... before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheShaggyDog">Courtney Walsh got Craig McDermott out</a> on the second last ball of the match.
</li><li> Arguably the most notorious example in cricket was the semi-final of the 1999 World Cup, fought between South Africa and Australia. Australia had set a modest total, and the South Africans were set to win in the last over with one wicket in hand. However, a run-out happened with the scores tied, and Australia were handed the victory on the basis that their average scoring rate in the group stages of the World Cup was higher than South Africa's.
</li><li> The rules of fencing (in epee, saber, and foil) state that when the score is tied with one touch remaining, the fencers must salute each other (in other words, when this trope comes into play). When bouts go to five touches, it happens all the time, but it's considerably more epic when it happens in a bout to fifteen.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AustralianRulesFootball">Australian Rules Football</a> has had the Adelaide Crows failing to make it to the semi-finals by the opposing team scoring a goal in the last ten seconds of the last quarter. Twice.
<ul><li> The <em>true</em> "down to the last play" situation, however, is when a player takes a mark or is awarded a free kick within scoring distance when the final siren goes - if this happens, the player is allowed to take their shot after the siren. North Melbourne's Malcolm Blight was the subject of two famous examples. The first was when he kicked a goal from around 80 metres out to defeat Carlton. In the second, Blight had kicked a behind (one point) to tie the score against Hawthorn, but was awarded a free kick as the siren went. He had the option of accepting the behind or taking another shot, chose to take the shot... and missed the goals completely, resulting in Hawthorn winning the game.
</li><li> Hell, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> has <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kicks_after_the_siren_in_Australian_rules_football">a whole list of Aussie Rules examples<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> With the AFL abandoning Grand Final Replays as of 2016, if a Grand Final is still tied after regulation extra time, it will become Golden Point (this trope). The final siren will <em>not</em> sound until the tie is broken.
</li></ul></li><li> The World's Strongest Man contest is almost always decided in this way, with the two final contenders going head-to-head in the final event (traditionally the Atlas Stones) to decide the winner. The 2014 final was a good example; for the first time, three men went into the final round with a shot at the title. Reigning champion Brian Shaw set a remarkable time on his run, but could only watch as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HafthorJuliusBjornsson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HafthorJuliusBjornsson">Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson</a> decimated it; ydrūnas Savickas, despite having been beaten by Hafþór, managed to pip Shaw's time by four-tenths of a second and thus secured the points he needed to win his fourth world title, beating Hafþór by <em>half a point</em>.
</li><li> The 1999 US Open Golf Championship's final day was almost perfectly set up for this trope, especially in the final groupings, which contained three of the most popular golfers of the year.. The young prodigy Tiger Woods was hitting his stride as one of the best golfers of the decade, and fan favorite Payne Stewart was paired with another young gun, Phil Mickelson, who was attempting to gain his first major victory in his career. The fun part? All three were within a shot or two of each other, and the tournament was settled with Payne Stewart's 15-foot putt for par, <em>barely</em> breaking free of the tie between him and Mickelson.
</li><li> In the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2010_Winter_Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics men's hockey final<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, Canada lead 2-1 against the USA. The Americans managed to tie the game by 2-2 in last period, with only 20 or so seconds left for the period, but Canadian Sidney Crosby scored the winning goal during overtime.
</li><li> A similar but much older match was the eight-game <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_Series">Summit Series<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> between Canada and the Soviet Union in 1972. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsPersonal">After going down a game after four games at home</a>, the Canadians went to the USSR <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicResolve">determined to beat the team of "supermen".</a> The tournament was tied and came down to the last game, when Canadian Paul Henderson scored the winner goal with less than a minute left on the clock.
</li><li> Happened at the 2009 Women's Field Hockey Champions Trophy in Sydney, Australia. The Hockeyroos, the Australian women's team, were the only team to have attended each edition of the annual tournament since its inception in 1987. The competition pits six of the best countries against each other in a week-long tournament. Due to the format of rules following an Olympic year, the Hockeyroos had to win to qualify for the tournament in 2010. They won all round games, except against Argentina, who they then faced in the finals. In the finals full time ended on a draw, and golden goal extra time ended with no goals, so the event went to penalty flicks to decide a winner. At the end of five flicks each, both teams had scored three goals. It then went to sudden death flicks, Australia missed and Argentina scored. The Hockeyroos now miss the Champions Trophy for 2010, even though they came second.
</li><li> The 1985 World Snooker Final, between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor fits the Trope ludicrously well. Davis (aged 27) has already won the title 3 times, is the best player in the world, and is hot favourite to win again. Taylor (aged 36) is a lovable Irishman, always joking with the crowd, in the world's top ten or so but apparently outclassed, despite having had a good season (coming back bravely after the death of his mother). In the first-to-18 final, Davis races to an 8-0 lead. Taylor fights back to 11-11, but can't get ahead. Davis takes a 17-15 lead, only for Taylor to pull back again to 17-17. The edgy final frame takes over an hour, and eventually Taylor pulls out a brilliant pot to take it to the final black. He then gets the first chance, but misses badly. Davis looks sure to be left a sitter, but it goes slightly awkward - still, he's left with a pot he'd get 9 times out of 10 to win. He misses too, leaving an easy chance. Taylor steadies himself, and pots it to win 18-17 after nearly 15 hours of play.
<ul><li> That final was awesome, in fact Taylor says that the ninth frame was his turning point. Davis just barely missed a black pot which would have put him up 9-0. Taylor was able to pot the colors and win his first frame. Davis has said that he "lost the plot" after that, and Taylor began to make his comeback. The final 35th frame was an epic, it lasted SIXTY-EIGHT minutes, since each player played so many safety shots. Truly a sight to behold for any cue sports fan.
</li></ul></li><li> Cycling: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TourDeFrance">Tour de France</a> 1989. After winning the Tour de France for the first time in 1986, in 1987, Greg LeMond was seriously injured in an hunting incident; his recovery took two years. The last stage of the 1989 Tour de France was a time-trail; Laurent Fignon was leading LeMond by 50 seconds, by many considered to be a decisive lead, considering the final time trail was a mere 25 km. Using (for the time) unorthodox equipment (flat aerobars; teardrop shaped helmet), LeMond beat Fignot by 58 seconds, winning the Tour de France by the smallest margin ever: 8 seconds. That's 8 seconds after 22 days, 3,285 km and 87h 38m 35s of cycling (a difference of 0.0025%). LeMond would win the Tour de France for a third and last time in 1990.
<ul><li> Fignon later pushed an idea through to management, that the final stage wouldn't be an ITT, and that the general classification would be safe by the time they reached that final stage.
</li><li> In 2011, Andy Schleck had a 57 seconds lead on Cadel Evans before the final counting stage in the general classification that year. The thing is, that stage was an ITT, which is a discipline where Evans is far superior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">highly specialized climbers</a> Andy and Fränk Schleck. The 4-second lead Fränk had, and the 57-second lead Andy had, was not enough, as Evans beat Andy by 2.31 and Fränk by 2.34, leaving the brothers from Luxembourg in second and third.
</li><li> This trope can happen in individual stages as well. In stage 14 of the 2014 Tour, breakaway rider <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer_(cyclist)">Jack Bauer<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (no, not <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwentyFour">that</a></em> Jack Bauer) looked like he was going to hold off the charging peloton, but he was caught less than 50 meters from the finish line. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding">Bauer finished 10th in a stage he looked like he would win</a>.
</li><li> Something almost identical happened to time trial specialist Tony Martin in the 2013 Vuelta a España. Martin, the world time trial champion, attacked at the start of the 175km 6th stage, led the entire stage, somehow kept the peloton back around 10 seconds behind in the final kilometers and was heartbreakingly caught with only 20-25 metres to go to the finish line. Happily however he did succeed with a similar breakaway in the 2014 Tour de France and won the stage.
</li></ul></li><li> Dick Mackey won the 1978 running of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in 14 days, 18 hours, 52 minutes, and 24 seconds, beating Rick Swenson by <em>one second.</em> The thousand-mile race was literally decided by a nose, as Mackey's lead dog was mere inches ahead of Swenson's.
</li><li> A Rugby Union example came in the 2003 Rugby World Cup final between Australia and England in Australia. After a half-time score of 5-14 to England, Elton Flatley kicked penalty goals for Australia in the 47th, 61st and 80th minutes to tie the game at 14-14. English fly half Jonny Wilkinson kicked a penalty goal to put England ahead in the 2nd minute of overtime, which Flatley responded to in the 97th minute with 3 minutes remaining. Wilkinson kicked a drop goal with 27 seconds left on the clock to win the game 20-17 and the World Cup for England. The commentary was special.
<div class="indent"> There's 35 seconds to go, this is the one. It's coming back to Jonny Wilkinson, he drops for World Cup glory. It's up! It's over! He's done it! Jonny Wilkinson is England's hero - yet again! And there's no time for Australia to come back. England have just won the World Cup.
</div></li><li> Probably more common in Rugby than you'd think - since after the 80 minutes passes, play doesn't end until the next stoppage (and even then not if it's a penalty), a well disciplined team trailing by a narrow margin always has time to launch a final attack. Case in point: trailing 29-32 to South Africa by the 79th minute of their opening pool game in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Japan twice rejected taking an easy 3 points with a penalty kick, instead going for the win. Two penalties, one rolling TMO (due to an inconclusive rolling maul) and a couple of reset scrums later (resulting in a total of one lineout and <em>four</em> 5 metre scrums), substitute Karne Hesketh touched down in the corner with his only touch of the game in the 84th minute to seal an improbable victory. Then there's the France vs Wales match during the 2017 Six Nations, which had <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">20 minutes</a></em> of added time before France scored a converted try to edge out Wales 20-18.
</li><li> While most poker games are decided by marginal decisions, high-ranking hands tend to provoke all-ins, often eliminating a player outright. A lot less contrived than sport examples, which require a close score and a well-timed window of opportunity.
</li><li> The 2012 NHL Winter Classic between the Philadelphia Flyers and the New York Rangers came down to a penalty shot. The Rangers had a 3-2 lead with just under 20 seconds remaining in regulation when the Flyers were awarded a penalty shot because a Ranger other than the goalkeeper had covered the puck in the goal crease (similar to the FIFA rule, except that the defender is not ejected, and a missed shot or save is dead). The Rangers' goalie made the save, and the Rangers held on to win the game.
<ul><li> The 2015 Winter Classic is up there, too. A well-contested matchup between the Blackhawks and Capitals was tied 2-2 in the second period and wasn't broken until 12.9 seconds to go in the game, when Troy Brouwer gets a rebound off a broken stick and fires home the game-winner for the Capitals.
</li></ul></li><li> As of 2016, the Stanley Cup has been won on an overtime goal 17 times. The most famous image of such a feat is Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins, who fell over as he scored on the St. Louis Blues' Glenn Hall, and was immortalized celebrating with his arms up as he was flying in front of the crease. However, it should be noted that this goal came at the end of a Bruins <em>sweep</em> of the Blues.
<ul><li> The 1999 Stanley Cup Finals ended on a highly controversial overtime goal scored by the Dallas Stars' Brett Hull on the Buffalo Sabres' Dominik Haek. It's still a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">sore point</a> for Buffalo fans.
</li><li> As of 2016, only two Cup-clinching overtime goals have ever come in a deciding Game 7. Both of those goals were scored by the Detroit Red Wings: by Pete Babando in the 1950 Finals against the New York Rangers, and by Tony Leswick in the 1954 Finals against the Montreal Canadiens.
</li></ul></li><li> Any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Tennis</a> game that goes to the final set<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note21xu18');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note21xu18" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note21xu18');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> either the third or fifth depending on the tournament</span> is like this.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wimbledon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a> 2009 men's singles final (Roger Federer vs Andy Roddick) went 2 sets all 16-14 in the final set. After 76 games, two points in the 77th (it went to deuce) are what wins it.
</li><li> The very next year, Wimbledon saw a longer match in the first round, with American John Isner beating Frenchman Nicolas Mahut <em>70-68</em> in the final set. That's right, that's one hundred thirty-eight games of tennis <em>in the final set alone</em>. It took 11 hours and 5 minutes, not counting the <em>two</em> times the match was suspended on account of darkness.
</li><li> The 2008 final between Federer and Rafael Nadal was this one to the T. Nadal won the first two sets, then when he was one point away from the victory Federer managed to save the third set on a tie-break and won also the fourth set on a tie-break, and in the fifth set they tied at the end of the fifth set, so whoever won two games in a row would get the set, the match and the title. Eventually it was Nadal, in what has bee lauded as one of the greatest matches in the history of teenis. Thanks in part to that victory, he took over Federer as World #1 a couple months later.
</li><li> The 2012 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Tennis">Australian Open</a> — Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic win two sets each, and the fifth goes to deuce before Djokovic wins the last two points in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigGame">nearly six-hour-long final</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This is a trope that could be applied to a match by the Danish handball team in every big tournament since the 2007 World Championships:
<ul><li> 2007 World Championships — Denmark vs Iceland (quarter final), In the end of first overtime of a very goal-rich match between the two arch rivals, the score is 41-41 before the final offensive play, then <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUWxZY5523Q">this happens<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Denmark finished 3rd in the tournament.
</li><li> 2008 European Championships — Denmark vs Germany (semi final). After a very even match, Denmark gets a penalty in the last attacking sequence. The legendary winger Lars Christiansen scores. Denmark later beats Croatia in the final
</li><li> 2008 Olympics — Denmark vs Russia (group stage). The game is a tie at 24-24, when the time runs out and Denmark has a free throw. Direct free throws are almost never scored on, but that doesn't stop the youngest player in the squad, Mikkel Hansen, from <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm4qDfFzoQU">scoring a crazy goal<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, getting very well known in Denmark. Denmark later got knocked out in the quarter finals, getting the worst result ever for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCoach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperCoach">Super Coach</a> Ulrik Wilbek in a big tournament - Mikkel Hansen is now regarded as one of the absolutely best handballers in the world
</li><li> 2009 World Championships - Denmark vs Serbia (group stage). A match which will probably be remembered for horrid defending and goalkeeping, it's a 36-36 tie in the final attack. With a five seconds to go, Lasse Boesen scores a goal, giving the victory to Denmark. Denmark lost the semi-finals and finished 4th
</li><li> 2010 European Championships - Denmark vs Norway (main round). Same as in the 2008 European championship, except the score being 23-23 before Anders Eggert took the penalty. Denmark finished 5th in that tournament.
</li><li> 2011 World Championships - Denmark vs France (final). Again it's the last attacking play, only this time, Denmark is one goal behind the defending champions at 30-31. It's being lined up for a shot, where everyone expects tournament top scorer Mikkel Hansen to take the shot. The ball is passed to Spellerberg instead, who scores and sends it to overtime. Denmark loses the final in overtime.
</li><li> 2012 European Championships - Denmark vs Macedonia (main round). Score is 32-32, 10 seconds left and the Macedonians are lining up for a shot which is to be taken by their star player, Kiril Lazarov. Lazarov shoots, save by Landin, rebound picked up by.. René Toft, pass to Hansen, pass to Lindberg, GOAL and with a second to spare. Video <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD_mJIgBs9s">here. Go to 0:50 to see the sequence)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Denmark went from (literally) zero to hero, the comeback starting with that win, ending with a 21-19 win against hosts Serbia in the final.
</li></ul></li><li> All three races of the 1978 Triple Crown were won by 2 lengths or less, with all three with the same win and place: Affirmed and Alydar, respectively. The most exciting came at the Belmont: the pair remained neck-and-neck down the entire stretch, with Affirmed winning it (and the Triple Crown, the last one for 37 years until American Pharoah won it in 2015) by a nose.
</li><li> In the final match of the final event in the WEC promotion, Anthony Pettis and Benson Henderson had split the first four rounds going into the fifth. With time running down, Pettis unleashed one of the craziest moves in MMA history, jumping off the fence and nailing Henderson in the face with the same foot. It somehow didn't knock Henderson out (though it did send him to the canvas), but did seal a decision win for Pettis and won him the promotion's lightweight championship.
</li><li> Australia's 1999 Cricket World Cup results were a lot like this in the later matches. Their final match in the Round Robin Super Six stage against South Africa was won with only two balls remaining. Their semi-final match, also against South Africa resulted in a tie after a mix-up on the final ball allowed one of the South African batsman to be run out, resulting in a tie and allowing Australia to advance to the final due to a higher net run-rate.
</li><li> ComedySportz. This is a popular improvisational theater "sport" <a class="urllink" href="http://www.comedysportz.com/find_us.html">played around the world<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It's played between two teams trying to get laughs from the audience. Because their goal is only to get laughs, they don't really care who wins or loses. As a result of this, they will do what the audience wants, and they know that the audience will like it when it is down to the last point. As such, a referee will always go out of his/her way in order to make the scores even, by being more strict or more lenient on the given teams. Players will do this as well, by trying to lose if they are winning by a landslide. The most frequent players even lampshade this, by commenting that it seems to happen a lot.
</li><li> The final of the netball competition at the 2010 Commonwealth Games between Australia and New Zealand ended up lasting nearly one-and-a-half times longer than a normal netball game. After 60 minutes, the scores were tied and the game went into extra time of seven minutes each way. After that didn't separate them, the game went into double extra time where the first team to be two goals ahead of the other wins. Ten minutes later, 84 minutes after the game started, New Zealand managed to get two goals ahead of Australia and win the game 66-64, and the gold medal.
</li><li> Giro d'Italia 2012 has the battle between Hesjedal and Rodriguez in the final time trial on the final stage. 28.2 km against the clock, where Rodriguez had a lead of 31 seconds before the stage. While Rodriguez put up one of the best time trials of his career, it wasn't enough to hold off the Canadian, leaving Hesjedal to win the Giro, the first Grand Tour by a Canadian.
</li><li> In a one day international cricket match in February 1981, when New Zealand was six runs behind Australia on the final ball, and New Zealand needed to score a six off the final ball to tie the game. This lead to the infamous <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underarm_bowling_incident_of_1981">underarm bowling incident<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in which bowler Trevor Chappell bowled the ball slow underarm, not illegal but incredibly unsportsmanlike, so it was impossible for batsman Brian McKechnie to even score a single run off it. The incident was condemned by both Australian and New Zealand cricket fans, and even each country's respective Prime Ministers.
<ul><li> Downplayed as it was unlikely that New Zealand would have scored a six off the last ball. McKechnie was a lower-order batsman (number 10 out of 11), facing his first ball, at a venue famous for its large boundary.
</li></ul></li><li> When a volleyball tiebreaker surpasses the regular 15 points and is forced to the "team only clinches it after getting a two point advantage" rule it gets particularly nail-biting. If it reaches the 25 points of regular sets - or even <em>surpasses</em> it - both audience and players will be nervous beyond any description.
</li><li> Similarly, playoffs in ice hockey can get exciting when games go into overtime, because in the playoffs the game doesn't end until one team scores the tiebreaking goal. The excitement grows even more when the game can be a series-clincher (more so if it's for the championship), and <em>especially</em> if it's the rubber game (the last in the series, usually game seven).
</li><li> In 1992 Olympics, gold medal favorite Midori Ito looked unlikely to win a medal at all, thanks to the disastrous short program she skated (she was crumbling under the intense pressure to win). Literally at the last minute of her long program, she threw in her signature triple Axel jump (she was the first woman to ever land one), resulting in her winning the silver medal.
</li><li> Many chess world championship matches were decided in the very last game, for instance, Lasker vs. Schlechter 1910 (Lasker had to win the last game to retain and won), Karpov vs. Korchnoi 1978 (the match went from 5-2 to 5-5, and then Karpov managed to win the last game and retain), Kasparov vs. Karpov 1985 (Karpov had to win the last game to retain, but lost), Kasparov vs. Karpov 1987 (Kasparov had to win the last game to retain and won), Kramnik vs. Leko 2004 (Kramnik had to win the last game to retain and won).
</li><li> In badminton, a match is decided by the best of three games. Each game requires one side to win by scoring 21 points, or two more points than the opponent, whichever is higher. To shorten match times however, a cap of 30 points was added, so if the score is 29-29, the one who scores the next point wins the game. As a result, this trope comes into play when this happens in the third and final game of the match.
</li><li> The 2018 NCAA Super Six team final for women's gymnastics came Down To The Last Routine for UCLA, who hadn't won a national championship in eight years and were up against the scoring machine that was the University of Oklahoma. In a moment that couldn't have fulfilled this trope any better if it was scripted by movie writers, the title came down to the very last routine for UCLA. Peng Peng Lee, a third-year senior<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note23mpq3');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note23mpq3" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note23mpq3');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">she got an extra two years of eligibility due to injuries that took her out of competition for two years</span> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">The Heart</a> of the team, who had already scored a perfect 10 on bars earlier that night, needed an all-but-perfect score to put the Bruins over the top after the team had struggled in the first two rotations. She delivered the performance of her life, scored yet another perfect 10, and clinched the title for the Bruins by five <em>hundredths</em> of a point over Oklahoma. It really has to be seen to be believed.
</li><li> Competitive board games aren't immune from this. The 2018 North American <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scrabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scrabble">Scrabble</a> Championship came down to a final match between Nigel Richards and Joel Sherman, both former champions. Richards led most of the match, but thanks to a fortuitous blank pull, Sherman bingoed out<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note24574y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note24574y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note24574y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">to "bingo" in Scrabble is to use all seven of your tiles at once, a 50-point bonushe did it on his final play, with no more tiles left to draw, so he also suffered no penalty for leftover tiles</span> with STR[i]NGS to win the title.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EurovisionSongContest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> has seen a few very tight finishes in the finals.
<ul><li> 1988 - Switzerland beat the United Kingdom by <em>one</em> point<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note25x4to');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note25x4to" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note25x4to');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This is especially nerve-wracking as, due to the way the judges sequentially announced scores that time (as in, Judge A mentioned which countries got their scores, then judge B did the same and so on), when the last judge gave Switzerland their score, everyone was left thinking just how wide United Kingdom's winning margin would be; instead, said last judge gave UK <strong>no</strong> point</span>. Which would be the narrowest margin of victory until
</li><li> 1991 - Wherein France and Sweden finished level on points, with Sweden winning by getting more sets of 10 points (they had tied on the first tie-breaker, as both got the same number of 12pts).<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note269ssg');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note269ssg" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note269ssg');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Had the current rules been used then - the first tie-breaker is how many countries voted for it - France would have won.</span>
</li><li> 1998 - With just Macedonia left to vote, Israel and Malta were tied on points. Macedonia would give Israel 6pts and Malta 0.
</li><li> 2003 - With just Slovenia left to vote, Turkey, Belgium and Russia could still all win. As a result, the televoting announcer <a class="urllink" href="https://youtu.be/gHizQRUp5cM?t=5m0s">jokingly walked away<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> before giving the votes (and Turkey the win).
</li><li> The Melodifestivalen-inspired voting system in place from 2016  each jury announces in turn, then total televote points are added in ascending order  is deliberately designed to prevent runaway winners and heighten the drama of the results portion of the show (working incredibly well both times)
</li></ul></li><li> The 2019 Cricket World Cup final went down to the final ball twice - first with England being bowled out on 241 runs on their very last ball, forcing a tie-break over, then again when New Zealand were only able to equal England's 15 tie break runs, causing them to lose on the final decider (namely which side had the most boundaries hit during the game). Even on that final ball, it all came down litertally to one play: a run out of Martin Guptil by Jason Roy and Jos Buttler: a split-second throw to down the bails before Guptil could make the winning run. Nasser Hussain comments: "<em>It came down to one bit of fielding. After seven weeks, could he get back for two? Could the throw come in? It did. Could Buttler get it back to the stumps on time?</em>" The sheer drama of this final, as well as the stakes involved, have quickly made this match a candidate for the best match ever in the history of the One Day International format.
