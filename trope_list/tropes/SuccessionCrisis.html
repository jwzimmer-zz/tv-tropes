</p><div class="indent"><em>"The King is dead! Long live the king! ...But </em>who<em> is the king?"</em>
</div><p>In theory, when the King dies, his heir steps straight into the vacancy, replacing him without any fuss, but too often that only happens in theory. In practice, the deaths of kings can be occasions of high drama. Rival claimants — with or without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">Royal Blood</a> — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWrongfulHeirToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWrongfulHeirToTheThrone">dispute the succession</a>, and even after the victor is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning">crowned</a>, they'll discover that their predecessor has left them with a host of problems, leaving their throne unstable for years to come.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>The first problem is deciding who is the rightful heir. There might seem to be a single clear candidate, but any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPrince">Evil Prince</a> worthy of the name can produce documents 'proving' the Crown Prince is ineligible, and must be passed over in favor of themselves (if he doesn't decide to simply resort to outright murder). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">Missing heirs will come out of the woodwork</a>, possibly impostors seizing the moment, possibly the real thing. Other powerful figures with no legitimate claims of their own but plenty of ambition (especially the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">Evil Chancellor</a>) may set themselves up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kingmaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kingmaker">Kingmakers</a> so that they can become the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManBehindTheMan">Man Behind the Man</a> for the winning side. And then there is sometimes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUsurper">The Usurper</a>, who often prefers to dispense with questions of legitimacy and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">take the throne by force</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">because no one else can or will stand up to him</a> and/or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingFamilyMassacre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulingFamilyMassacre">he just slaughtered everyone with a legitimate claim to the throne</a>. Expect lots of backstabbery in this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyDecadentCourt">Deadly Decadent Court</a>.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>This is naturally even worse when, in fact, there is no way to determine the rightful heir. For instance, Roman emperors never had their laws codify who was the emperor's heir (though some techniques were used to try to secure the succession), and while Peter the Great decreed that the Tsar would name his heir, <em>he</em> never actually designated one, leaving the field wide open. An <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectiveMonarchy">Elective Monarchy</a> is almost bound to have a crisis.
</p><p>If the rightful heir is foreign royalty, particularly the monarch of a rival country, almost the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardRoyalCourt">entire court</a> will unite to prevent them inheriting the crown out of simple self-interest. The foreign heir will object to this, vigorously, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAndWhatArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAndWhatArmy">he will have an army backing him up</a>. When there are several candidates with a convincing legal argument, the dispute is normally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">settled on the battlefield</a>, often with the death of one or more of the claimants.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_3"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_3'); })</script></div></div><p>Female heirs (and sometimes, even males claiming inheritance through the female line) may face more difficulty in becoming the next monarch. In countries with a long tradition of ruling Queens, they might stand as good a chance as anyone. Elsewhere, however, the alternative male candidates will argue that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">women shouldn't count</a>, often with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAndWhatArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouAndWhatArmy">the help of an army</a>. Such a situation occurred with Henry I of England's designated heir Matilda (Henry produced over 20 bastards, but only two <em>legitimate</em> kids who grew to adulthood, and she was the only one left by then).
</p><p>Similar problems arise if there are other restrictions on who may hold the crown, such as race, religion, or magical talent. If the rightful heir is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem">underage</a>, they might be passed over completely, but more often, they'll get a regent. The great magnates will compete vigorously for this post, with its near-royal status and opportunity to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilChancellor">corrupt the young ruler</a>. However, even when the laws state that a Queen cannot rule, it is <em>not</em> unknown for a country to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">Loophole Abuse</a> to get out of a Succession Crisis  said loophole frequently being the laws not stating what gender a King must be. More than one nation has thus ended up with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsTheKing">a woman King.</a>
</p><p>Sometimes there's a time limit involved: the prince <em>must</em> be crowned king within a specific timeframe or at a specific time, otherwise someone else gets the kingship. Other times, though, there are no traceable heirs. The late king was childless, and all his close relatives are dead, unacceptable, or unwilling to accept the crown. This gives all the neighboring countries an excuse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown">to nominate a friendly noble</a>, or discover some distant relationship.
</p><p>Or there can be succession mandates with serious penalties. For example, the Grimaldi family owns the country of Monaco, because, basically, they got a contract from France saying so back in the 13th Century. However, their contract ends if the current Prince (or Princess) dies without a direct descendant. There were worries for a time that Monaco might revert back to French control if both of Prince Rainer's children, who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">not exactly known for participating in safe practices</a>, were to be killed and he didn't get married and have another kid fast enough. So far, it looks like there have been some changes in the activities of the members of House Grimaldi and the chance that France will be able to take Monaco back is no longer likely.
</p><p>Even if the new king is the old one's son, they'll soon discover their training didn't properly prepare them for the reality. More often, in fiction, the throne will go to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">someone completely unprepared</a>, either a young prince who didn't expect to gain the throne for many years, or a distant relative <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">or younger prince</a> who never expected to gain the throne at all, and the kingdom will be on the brink of disaster when they take over.
</p><p>The crisis may be external  if the old king died in battle, the new king is going to have to rally a defeated army and turn the war around. Or, it may be internal  examples include an empty treasury, impending (or ongoing) famine, or a brewing rebellion. Either way, the new king will be sorely tested before their crown is safe.
</p><p>If there is no real heir, the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfferedTheCrown">Offered the Crown</a> can produce this as nobles intrigue to get their favorite candidate offered it.
</p><p>The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns">Rightful King Returns</a> is also a common way for this plot to be resolved.
</p><p>Note that this trope is not exclusive to monarchies by any stretch: For a particularly common political plot in the modern day, see the United States' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFifthAmendment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyFifthAmendment">Twenty-Fifth Amendment</a>.
</p><p>This is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>! However, the preponderance of constitutional monarchies (for those nations which still retain a monarch) make future occurrences of this trope highly unlikely. National legislatures ultimately dictate who is or is not eligible for the throne and most constitutional monarchies have clear chains of succession spelled out in law. In the UK, for example, it would take a severe disaster to eliminate heirs to get to the point where there would be a succession crisis. Even if a country declares itself a republic, this doesn't avert the situation entirely  the US has its share of difficulties. See below for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> examples.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMatriarch">Reverend Kasuga's</a> primary motivation in the second and third volumes is avoiding the massive succession crisis that she feared would occur if it became known that Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu died <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">without a male heir</a>. Anyone that has read volume one (set about 80 years later) is well aware that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">the secret came out</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwesomeMomentOfCrowning">at some point.</a>
</li><li> Two shoguns later Tsunayoshi's only heir died, and even after she hit menopause, she held off naming her niece Ienobu successor as long as possible (despite Ienobu being obviously the most qualified candidate) because her father had been rivals with Ienobu's grandfather.
</li><li> Ienobu died with only one sickly, underage heir, reviving the succession crisis, which culminated in a scandal that brought down the senior chamberlain and the privy counselor. This rendered them unable to oppose the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnexpectedSuccessor">succession by coup</a> of Yoshimune of Kii.
</li><li> Yoshimune's two older daughters are in competition for the throne (as the eldest has significant physical and emotional disabilities) but she resolves the crisis by abdicating in favor of the eldest and then ruling from behind the scenes to prevent her younger daughter, Munetake from seizing power.
</li><li> And then the crisis is revived yet again when Ieharu's only daughter dies, with Munetake promoting the claims of her daughter Sadanobu, only for Ieharu to remove her from the succession altogether after Munetake dies by having her adopted as the heir to another family, all at the instigation of Sadanobu's rival for the throne, Harusada. Then she abdicates her claim to the throne altogether to ensure that it goes to her <em>son</em>, making Ienari the first male shogun in decades. Harusada did this to ensure that she'd hold the power behind the throne, without the pressure to bear a daughter.
</li><li> However, that leads to the <em>next</em> succession crisis: Ienari has so many children that one of these is inevitable. Harusada took it upon herself to poison the grandchildren she doesn't like (and it's implied she did that because she was <em>bored</em>) and after her death the various concubines started poisoning each other's children. However, Ienari took a page from Yoshimune and abdicated in favor of one his sons. He also pre-empted another crisis by declaring Ieyoshi's daughter Iesada next in line after him, as she was the only one of his children to show any competence.
</li><li> Another begins to happen during Iesada's reign, as the nobles are divided between Lady Tomiko, who's closer in blood to Iesada but young and female, and Yoshinobu, whom many favor because he's male and quite intelligent, but Iesada considers him to be heartless and unfit to be shogun, believing he would cause the ruin of the Tokugawa regime. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Complicating things further is that Iesada conceives a child, something she thought impossible to do because of all the times she was poisoned. She ends up dying in the middle of her pregnancy though, taking the child with her, and Tomiko is named heir, taking the name Iemochi.</span>

In true fashion, a wrestling tournament is held to see which Kinnikuman is the rightful heir.

After Akito's father, Akira, dies, there's a huge dispute over whether his wife Ren or his child Akito should take over as Head of the Family. Akito ends up winning, since it's in Akira's will, but considering that we only hear about that stipulation from the head maid (who has always despised Ren) after the conflict has had some time to escalate, it's possible she made it up.

Case and point: Baby Beel and his older brother En. Though, it's assumed that whoever inherits the Beelzebub is the true successor to the throne. Since En did not inherit the title despite being the eldest, it's obvious who their father's successor is. This causes En a considerable amount of (somewhat childish) angst, and claim that he is an "unwanted child," perhaps in realization of that and the fact that he tends to act like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat">Spoiled Brat</a>.

</li><li> The Crown enters one after Joffrey's madness becomes widespread knowledge after an incident at a major banquet. One of the reasons Robert's rule was tolerated was because it got the Mad King Aerys off the throne. Westeros will not tolerate another Mad King, to the point of going to war over it. This is an issue because Tommen, Myrcella, <em>and</em> Stannis all died during the Plague  and with Renly disqualified from the line of succession due to having a male soulmate, that leaves only Shireen as the only other possible heir.

In this case, on the eve of the Battle of Endor, Vader himself decides to take steps to ensure the Empire ends up in the right hands, first by declaring himself the Emperor's official successor and that, in the event of his own demise, his chosen heir - his son, Luke Skywalker - will take the throne next. He also sets things up to avoid a succession crisis, by eliminating any others (like Ysanne Isard, and certain dissenting Moffs) who might try to seize control from Luke; these orders go into effect when he contacts Admiral Piett (who'd remained in charge of the fleet but was transferred to another Star Destroyer in order to increase his odds of survival) during his dying moments.

<ul><li> The Lannisters want to keep their grip on the Iron Throne through Cersei's children: unfortunately, her eldest Joffrey is <em>extremely</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxeCrazy">bloodthirsty, sadistic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidEvil">and dumb about it</a>, to the point his grandfather Tywin seriously considers to disinherit him.

Their sister Myrcella inherited brains, kindness and assertiveness, if there was not for her gender. And that's without taking in account their true incestuous parentage, which deprives them from any kind of claim to the crown.
</li><li> On the Baratheon side, Stannis was suddenly killed by a bowel sickness, leaving his daughter Shireen behind. Not only the girl is young and in deep mourning, people are looking at her askew for surviving grayscale with a heavily scarred face and potentially falling sick again, unleashing an epidemic in King's Landing. After Shireen comes her uncle Renly, who's rather proficient as a courtier and diplomat but completely inefficient as a warrior, something the martial Seven Kingdoms tend to mislike. Being gay also means the probability of him siring a successor is depressingly weak.
</li><li> For those dreaming of a Targaryen restoration, the candidates are rather lacking. Viserys was completely off his rocker before he got the brilliant idea to annoy his barbarian brother-in-law into murdering him, so nope. Viserys' younger sister Daenerys <em>could</em> have inherited the crazy gene at the light of her currently destabilizing Essos, on top of being too female for a ruler. It leaves their nephew "Jon Snow", born Jaehaerys Targaryen, who's an accomplished warrior, deeply charismatic, genuinely concerned for the smallfolk's welfare... and very busy dreaming to definitely leave Westeros behind to spend his life in Skyrim, so not interested in being enthroned as King.

Naturally, it doesn't go according to plan.
</li><li> This trope is what starts the main plot of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Maleficent">Maleficent</a></em>: King Henry, the cruel ruler of the humans, is fatally wounded in battle by Maleficent. Because he has no male heir, he proposes to the noblemen assembled before his deathbed that whoever can kill Maleficent will ascend the throne and have his daughter's hand in marriage. At the same time, Stefan, Maleficent's childhood friend, overhears Henry's decree (as an adult, Stefan now works as a servant in the king's castle) and, realizing that this is the perfect opportunity to fulfill his dream of being king, goes to Maleficent, claiming to have come just to warn her. Once he has her drugged and asleep, however, Stefan cannot bring himself to kill her, and simply <em>cuts off her wings</em> and lies to the king, thus gaining the throne in return. Unfortunately, Maleficent is still alive (if no longer able to fly), and out for revenge...

Despite Queen Clarisse's objection, the only way Mia can assume her duties as Queen is if she marries within the next 30 days. Devereaux didn't actually want the throne (he was told that was what his father wanted  it was really a lie created by his power-hungry uncle), and Mia eventually does gain the crown by initiating a new law during her cancelled wedding to allow a queen to be crowned without being married. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">The fact that Devereaux and Mia were falling in love with each other probably helped</a>.

Uther Pendragon fell in love with Ygraine, wife of his enemy Gorlois. In exchange for Merlin's help in winning her, Uther promised his and Ygraine's son to Merlin, who gave the child into the custody of the knight Sir Ector. The nobles of Britain were unaware of this though, so after Uther died, seemingly childless, the nobles fought amongst themselves for the right to become king. Bishop Brice prayed for a miracle that would resolve the crisis; thus, the Sword in the Stone appeared. The nobles and knights in turn tried to pull the sword, but all failed; finally, a tournament was held to decide who would become king, but it was interrupted when it was discovered that Arthur had pulled the sword from the stone, and after it was replaced, it was proven that only he could remove it. Even then, the crisis wasn't fully resolved because several of the nobles refused to accept Arthur as king because of his young age; it wasn't finished until he defeated all these rivals to the throne in battle, followed by securing his kingdom against the invading Saxons and other foes.

</li><li> Much of the first season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey">Downton Abbey</a></em> revolves around a variation of this: instead of a country trying to figure out who will be the next monarch, it's a group of nobles  the Crawley family, the head of which holds the title Earl of Grantham  trying to determine who will be the inheritor of their estate and its title, after the heir presumptive dies aboard the <em>Titanic</em>. The current (6th) Earl, Robert, would very much like to leave as much as possible to his eldest daughter, Lady Mary, but the terms of his marriage contract with his wife Cora put the kibosh on that. You see, the 5th Earl foolishly stipulated that Cora's fortune would be entailed to the estate  that is, assigned to whomever inherited the title "Earl of Grantham." With a few rare exceptions  and this isn't one  British peerages go to "the heirs male of the body" of the grantee; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeirClubForMen">they cannot be inherited in the female line</a>. Lord and Lady Grantham went on to have three daughters and no sons. The solution was for Mary to marry the next male in line, her second cousin and good friend of the family Patrick Crawley (the Earl and Patrick's father were friends growing up), and thus keep hold of her mother's money, but then the <em>Titanic</em> happened, and Patrick was on it. The next closest male relative is the Earl's third cousin once removed (and thus <em>fourth</em> cousin to Mary and her sisters), and he's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan">Self-Made Man</a> who's not sure he wants to marry Mary and give up his career as a corporate-law solicitor to "run the estate" (i.e. be an idle aristocrat). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Eventually he does, quite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">happily</a>, we might add...but he's so very businesslike about that it drives the Earl mad.

Moya's crew lands on a Sebacean planet where succession goes through the eldest child regardless of gender, but only if they are married (to someone who can give them viable offspring) by a certain age. Since Princess Katralla's DNA was poisoned by her younger brother, she despairs of ever finding a Sebacean male who is compatible and thinks she will have to forfeit the throne. This is particularly problematic since Prince Clavor will lead the society into destruction at the hands of the Scarrans if he is allowed to rule. Fortunately for her, John shows up. As he is human and not Sebacean, he is genetically capable of producing an heir with her and is practically forced to wed her. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The Queen even has her daughter artificially inseminated with his DNA to make sure there will be a continuing line.</span>

Daenerys Targaryen, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, finally comes home to Westeros to reclaim her birthright. However, Daenerys was rendered barren by Mirri's spell and cannot have children. Tyrion attempts to discuss it by offering alternatives about who should succeed her, but Daenerys is unwilling to hear it and will only address this after her conquest is complete. Making things even more difficult is her forming a relationship with the new King of the North, Jon Snow, who is revealed to the audience as the trueborn son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, Aegon Targaryen (making him Ned Stark's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism">nephew</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatestStoryNeverTold">not his illegitimate son</a>, as well as Daenerys' nephew), and therefore, by the laws of succession, is the rightful king of Westeros</span>.

This results in Varys scheming for the same purpose. Tyrion argues that the Daenerys and Jon should get married since incestuous marriage has been a traditional Targaryen practice but Varys speaks against this, saying that marrying one's aunt is not common practice in the North, where Jon grew up.

The players are usually hired by a banker to whom the king owed a lot of money and who is being pressured by the Great Houses to foreclose on the Rinaldi estate so they can buy it from him, but he can't until they know what happened to the prince. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">His stepmother drove him completely insane with a curse, he can't even speak coherently. And there's at least two other factions looking for him, and an impostor, and Amalsand wants him dead so her own son can claim the throne.</span>
</li><li> <em>Successors</em> is a game that begins right after the death of Alexander the Great, and chronicles the violent implosion of the Macedonian empire as Alexander's generals fight each other over the empire. Players struggle to either prove themselves the legitimate heir to Alexander's empire, to install one of Alexander's sons on the throne as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppetKing">Puppet King</a>, or to let Alexander's empire fall, murder his heirs, and carve out the strongest successor state from the ashes.

<ul><li> A lot of strategy games are based around a succession crisis. This is not only because it's a highly realistic story, but due to the fact that they are based around wars, that this is actually not that far off from reality.

</li><li> Muslim rulers, introduced in the <em>Sword of Islam</em> expansion, are required to take "open" succession, which means that the son who already possesses the greatest title(s) inherits when you die. And Muslims take Decadence penalties for having male relatives with no lands and are expected to take multiple wives based on their rank, so it's practically guaranteed that your demense will be split up between your many heirs even before you kick the bucket.

</li><li> There are two concurrent succession crises in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins">Dragon Age: Origins</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Fereldan succession crisis, caused by King Cailan Theirin's death without a legitimate heir fighting the darkspawn at Ostagar, frames much of the main plot, but the protagonist only gets involved <em>after</em> the civil war is mostly over. Problem is, the only candidates for the throne are the late king's wife (who isn't of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalBlood">Royal Blood</a> herself), the bastard son of said king's father (by an elven mother, no less, which would make him a target of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">Fantastic Racism</a> if anyone ever found out), and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> (but only if they are of the Human Noble origin and choose to run for it). All the while, a paranoid <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard">manipulative</a> regent with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">facade of righteousness</a> makes the mess even murkier. Just to add to that pressure, a nigh-on unstoppable horde of monsters has nearly destroyed the standing army and is getting <em>very</em> close to wiping out the country outright. The remaining army is on the brink of civil war and all foreign aid has been blocked at the borders until far too late to make a difference. Without getting a king/queen to sort this mess out soon, the country is utterly boned. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Possible resolutions are: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBastard">Heroic Bastard</a> Alistair becomes king, Dowager Queen Anora becomes queen regnant, Alistair and Anora marry and rule together (the outcome of Alistair's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionSpecificSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompanionSpecificSidequest">Companion-Specific Sidequest</a> determining which of them is really in charge), or the Human Noble Warden rules, possibly marrying either Alistair or Anora as well. Additionally, another permutation for a non-Human Noble female PC who romances Alistair (again depending on his sidequest) is for her to become his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMistress">mistress</a>. Whew!</span>
</li><li> The Orzammar Dwarves are in the middle of a succession crisis of their own. One candidate, the son of the late king, is suspected of framing one sibling for the murder of their brother. The other candidate, the head of another noble house, claims the king said on his deathbed that he did not want his remaining son to be king, but no one else can verify this.
</li><li> A succession crisis is averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeII">Dragon Age II</a></em> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Viscount Dumar is killed during the qunari uprising</span>. With no leader available and no heir, the Templars step in and assume total control over the city, which actually makes things <em>worse</em> because the Knight-Commander Meredith is refusing to let a new Viscount be decided, citing the "blood mage problem" as justification for her military rule and that she will allow a new Viscount to be elected once the crisis is averted. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">If Hawke sides with the Templars at the end, s/he becomes the new Viscount upon Meredith's death.</span>
</li><li> Sebastian also mentions that preventing one of these was a factor in him being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedAwayInAMonastery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedAwayInAMonastery">Locked Away in a Monastery</a>. His frustration with being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheUnfavorite">The Unfavorite</a> due to being the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpareToTheThrone">spare to the spare</a> as the third son led to him acting out by being a womanizing hedonist. His parents feared that if Sebastian's various affairs were to produce any illegitimate children, it would have caused a bunch of trouble down the line for their legitimate grandchildren.
</li><li> It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">All There in the Manual</a> that the two strongest clans in Nevarra are gearing up for one of these (the current King and his likely successor are both childless old men).
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2AssassinsOfKings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher2AssassinsOfKings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a></em>, the king isn't even dead. That doesn't stop anyone from waging wars over the king's illegitimate sons to have a better position once he's dead. The king doesn't like that a bit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he dies and things go <em>really</em> to hell.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft">World of Warcraft</a></em>
<ul><li> A succession crisis in the dwarven backstory, called the War of the Three Hammers, ended up splitting the dwarves of Ironforge into the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron clans. Technically, the clans already existed, but the succession crisis and the brutal war drove the Wildhammers and the Dark Irons out of Ironforge, resulting in them forming completely separate kingdoms.
</li><li> Even though King Magni Bronzebeard of Ironforge and of Khaz Modan is still alive at the game's beginning, fears of a future crisis result from the discovery that his daughter Moira is pregnant by Emperor Dagran Thaurissan of the Dark Iron Dwarves, following his kidnapping her and allegedly putting her under his spell, though Moira claims that there never was a spell, nor even a kidnapping. Even if the bastard heir is accepted by the king, the rest of the Ironforge dwarves might rebel in sheer horror and disgust at the thought of a half-Dark Iron being their king.
</li><li> This crisis comes to pass in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarcraftExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WarcraftExpandedUniverse">Warcraft</a></em> novel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShatteringPreludeToCataclysm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheShatteringPreludeToCataclysm">The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm</a></em>, which details the events leading up to the <em>Cataclysm</em> expansion. During the story, King Magni turned to crystal in a ritual to protect his people from the Cataclysm, paving the way for Moira to seize power. The crisis was eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">defused</a> after the Council of Three Hammers consisting of Moira, Muradin Bronzebeard, and Falstad Wildhammer was formed as a power-sharing measure.
</li><li> In one of the comics leading up to <em>Legion</em>, Magni wakes up from his crystal slumber. There are immediately fears that Magni will once again assume the throne, undoing the unity the Council of Three Hammers has achieved, potentially re-igniting the old conflicts and putting everything right back where it started. Fortunately for that, Magni has other issues to contend with, as he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes the Speaker for Azeroth itself</span>.
</li><li> The Shaman Campaign in <em>Legion</em> forces the shamans of the Earthen Ring to resolve two separate succession crises in Skywall and the Firelands, the elemental realms of wind and fire. Both have been leaderless since their prior rulers, Al Akir and Ragnaros, were destroyed in <em>Cataclysm</em>, and two factions in each realm are warring for final control. The shamans, wishing to unite all four elemental lords to fight the Burning Legion, take the side of the less hostile candidates for leadership against the ones that would ignore or kill them out of hand.
</li></ul></li><li> Features twice in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazeUnion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlazeUnion">Blaze Union</a></em>. In the B route, it's revealed that this was one of the reasons that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Luciana and Aegina were ordered assassinated; Alanjame didn't want to deal with a Succession Crisis-inspired civil war while he was trying to take over the country</span>, and in the C route, the fact that Soltier doesn't have an heir and Bronquia would almost certainly destroy itself over picking a new Emperor is why Gram Blaze has no choice but to make sure he stays alive.

<ul><li> Backstory examples:
<ul><li> The 1st Era Empire of the Nords collapsed in large part due to a succession crisis. High King Borgas, the last direct heir of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Ysgramor</a>, fell in battle. A "moot" was held among the Jarls of Skyrim to name a new High King, but they could not settle on a candidate. The War of Succession broke out, costing the Nords all of their territory outside of Skyrim, with Skyrim itself fractured into warring independent territories. It would take over 50 years for the crisis to end, with Olaf One-Eye being named High King via the Pact of Chieftains.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">War of the Red Diamond</a> in the 3rd Era started as the result of such a crisis. After the death of Emperor Antiochus Septim, his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AChildShallLeadThem">15-year-old daughter Kintrya II</a> took over as Empress. However, her aunt, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">infamous "Wolf Queen" Potema</a>, accused Kintrya of being a bastard and therefore illegitimate. Potema declared her son (nephew to Antiochus), Uriel III, as the rightful heir. Potema and Uriel were joined by the disgruntled leaders of several of the Empire's provinces in starting the war, as well as an alliance with the Maormer (Sea Elves hostile to Tamriel), who invaded southern Tamriel, creating a two-front war for the strained Empire. Kintrya would be captured by Potema's forces and would die in captivity. However, her supporters, now led by her uncle Cephorus, would strike back and kill Uriel III, ending his claim to the throne. Cephorus would take over as Emperor, defeat most of Potema's forces, and then kill Potema herself after a protracted 10-year insurgency. It was the largest conflict the 3rd Empire of Tamriel had faced since it was founded (and would remain as such until the Oblivion Crisis).
</li></ul></li><li> A subplot in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsIIDaggerfall">Daggerfall</a></em> involves this between Princess Elysana and Prince Helseth of Wayrest; they both have a claim to the throne, and it's left to a council to decide who would inherit on King Eadwyre's death. A side quest involves either blackmailing (Helseth) or killing (Elysana) a council member to curry favor for either heir. Between <em>Daggerfall</em> and <em>Morrowind</em>, Elysana is coronated Queen of Wayrest and exiles Helseth and his mother, Barenziah, to Morrowind.

The Elder Council, led by High Councilor Ocato, essentially form a Regency. This succession crisis is compounded by the fact that the forces of Oblivion are no longer magically impeded from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellOnEarth">invading Cyrodiil</a>. It is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownplayedTrope">downplayed</a>, mostly from a deliberate choice on the part of the designers to avoid complicated politics in favor of a relatively simple black-and-white saving the world story, partly from the fact that you early on find out there is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenBackupPrince">rightful (bastard) heir</a> who is accepted by the relevant authorities. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Then he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">sacrifices his life to stop the Daedric invasion</a>, setting the stage for the succession crisis in <em>Skyrim</em>'s backstory.</span>
</li><li> As a consequence of <em>Oblivion</em>, another succession crisis occurs. Ocato is named <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">Potentate</a> (a reserve title which can be granted by the Elder Council, effectively establishing a permanent regency), but is soon assassinated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ANaziByAnyOtherName">Thalmor</a> assassins, seeking to destabilize the Empire to make way for the rebirth of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYouElves">Aldmeri</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHumanAlliance">Dominion</a>. War breaks out again as several local powers jockey for the Ruby Throne, eventually ending with the Colovian warlord Titus Mede claiming it. The period is known as the Stormcrown Interregnum, since Potentate Ocato's rule is an extension of the Septim Empire (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FounderOfTheKingdom">Tiber Septim</a> was anointed "Stormcrown" by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Greybeards</a>).

Shortly before the events of the game, pro-independence Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak challenged High King Torygg to a duel for his throne. It is an archaic but legitimate practice among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HornyVikings">Nords</a>. Stormcloak wins by using the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageOfMagic">Thu'um</a> to kill Torygg. Victorious, Stormcloak and his followers feel that he should be named the new High King of Skyrim. The Jarls of Skyrim, who vote for the new High King, are torn due to Stormcloak's use of the Thu'um being seen as cheating. Eastern Skyrim secedes under Stormcloak's leadership, while western Skyrim (and the Empire) support Torygg's widow, Elisif, for the throne, leading to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWar">Civil War</a>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> can resolve the crisis by joining the war on either side, and there's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMod">Game Mod</a> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41087/">available<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that lets you take the throne for yourself.

By completing the quest given to him, Sir Graham is proven worthy of being the childless King Edward's heir, preventing Daventry from falling into chaos when said king dies mere moments after the quest is complete. Recovering the three treasures was more of a way for him to know the kingdom was in good hands, and a final test for his best knight. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanSequel">Fan Sequel</a> took it a step further by creating a legendary first king who handed the throne to his trusted knight when he died in battle without heirs.

After the previous king's death, the choice falls between his two sons Roland (good) and Archibald (not so good). The four royal seers to make the decision fall to "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">tragic accidents</a>": one dies in a boating accident (hit by magical lightning), one slips and falls from the castle wall, one is "randomly" attacked by a dragon, and one dies of food poisoning. Archibald accuses his brother of murder and has him exiled. The player is a general who may choose to support either brother and may even switch sides halfway through. The canonical ending has Roland win, though, becoming the next (and last) King of Enroth.
</li><li> Prior to the events of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuikodenV">Suikoden V</a></em>, there was the Falenan Succession Conflict. After the death of their mother, Princess Falzrahm fought her elder sister Crown Princess Shahrewar for the throne. Rather than a flat-out civil war, both sides took advantage of the royal cabal of assassins known as Nether Gate to kill off supporters on both sides. Eventually, Shahrewar withdrew her claim, only to be promptly assassinated by Falzrahm to <em>ensure</em> the conflict wouldn't continue. Ironically, Falzrahm only ruled for two years before passing away. Having grown up in this poisonous environment, their daughters decided to nip any potential problems in the bud: Arshtat took the throne, while her sister Sialeeds and cousin Haswar agreed to never marry or have children.
<ul><li> Unfortunately, this didn't quite work out as planned. Although the next queen (Lymsleia, the protagonist's younger sister) was never in doubt, a crisis occurred with regards to who would marry her and become royal consort and head of the country's military. This is traditionally decided through a tournament of champions, but since House Godwin won it through drugging or discrediting all potential threats to their champion, a lot of people were upset with this choice. The Godwins then tried to solidify their rule by assassinating the current Queen and Commander right away, when Lymsleia is still too young to rule on her own. The prince (the protagonist) was able to survive this assassination attempt, and much of the country begins to look to him as preferential to Gizel Godwin as leader of the Queendom (including the father of another contender for Lymsleia's hand, with whom the Prince takes refuge). And thus the stage is set for the civil war that comprises the majority of the game.
</li></ul></li><li> Some of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TotalWar">Total War</a></em> games allow this to happen if your faction leader buys the farm in certain circumstances  usually when the leader dies without any male heirs, but it can also happen when the heir presumptive is unpopular enough that one of his royal siblings rebels in an effort to take succession. The manual for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MedievalTotalWar">Medieval: Total War</a></em> (which allowed you to choose which side to support) actually suggested engineering one of these to dispose of a weak family line, and a savvy player who sees one coming can pick his best general, give him the biggest army, and then marry him to a princess. If you're going to have a succession crisis, it's best to make sure it's a <em>quick</em> one.

Unpopular kings or unpopular heirs can cause civil wars in that mod.

The transition into democracy is almost as tense as the succession crisis itself, especially since one of the candidates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeetTheNewBoss">secretly intends to subvert the new system from the inside out</a>.</span>

The series is about Lubek trying to retake the throne.
