</div></div><p>So, you just happen to be the child of that army guy who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative">went native</a> and married <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChiefsDaughter">The Chief's Daughter</a>? Or perhaps the reverse applies and dear mum left home and joined dad on the ancestral family homestead back in rural Smalltownington. This of course is assuming both your parents <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">are alive</a> and love each other (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarCrossedLovers">Star-Crossed Lovers</a> have a tendency to have it rough). You might, after all, be the product of accidental affairs, or worse yet, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildByRape">rape</a>. And then you were born. Congratulations, you are now guaranteed to be despised by one or both sides of your family. Maybe it was that time you wore the ritual face paint to Sunday school...

("Half-caste" is a roughly synonymous term.)
</p><p>Lucky for you, you (hopefully) have the love and support of your immediate family, and if you had a shaman/witch-doctor/priestess <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WitchSpecies">in the family genes</a>, you can most assuredly tell them where to stick their supremacist ideologies by unleashing the can of mystical whup-ass. Conversely, you may need to give the other side of the family the can of whup-ass if the tribe never accepts you as one of them, but let's not dwell.
</p><p>Life may be difficult. If you bear a closer resemblance to one parent over the other, you might tend to stick out like a sore thumb. Fortunately, genetics is probably on your side. Not only are you likely to possess an exotic attractiveness, you may even have the ability to pass as either race at any given time.

</p><p>The "tragic mulatto" is an old trope of period literature, and involves a character of mixed white and black or other ethnic ancestry who's not accepted by his or her community, often with tragic results.

Hybrid children aren't even accepted into standard day-cares. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Legosi's mother feared this discrimination due to being half-wolf and half Komodo Dragon, and tried to look and act like a pure-blood wolf even as her father's scales started to appear on her.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetShopOfHorrors">Pet Shop of Horrors</a></em>: In one story, a Filipino woman marries a much older Japanese man and has a son with him. When her husband has a stroke and begins to suffer from dementia, the rest of his family makes no secret of how they think a mixed-race child is not fit to inherit and that the man's pure-blood Japanese grandson is a much better choice as a successor. Given that the family is shown as being <em>incredibly</em> dysfunctional (notably the grandson is selfish <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and kills his grandfather to please his mother</span> while the mixed-race son is polite and kind), the story is firmly on the side of the Filipino woman and her son.

Oh, and it turned out the man had been faking his dementia and ensured that his mixed-race son inherited everything, now that he saw how despicable the rest of the family was.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ReZero">Re:Zero</a></em>, half-elves experience extreme prejudice and fear. This fear is only heightened by the fact that Satella, the Witch of Envy that once threatened the entire world, was a half-elf. Main character Emilia experiences this prejudice to the maximum extent, since with her white hair and other features she's a perfect match for Satella's description.

While it's somewhat understandable for wizards to be nervous about hanging around someone who turns into a monster every so often, the fact that they only transform during the full moon and the fact that the Wolfsbane Potion allows transformed werewolves to essentially be harmless makes the extent of discrimination against them pretty excessive.

Contrary to what many Westerners might think, Japanese and Korean people <em>do</em> look different if you look closely enough. One extreme example was the Japanese Emperor having to apologize in public because of his Korean ancestor - from <em>800 years ago</em>.
</li><li> Real life is quite fickle with this trope. In one place, those of mixed-race descent are of higher status than those who are purely one race. An example is the Colorist system of the Caribbean, where those who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">look "whiter" (or have a larger percentage of white ancestry)</a> have higher social standing.
<ul><li> It often depends on how each group 'counts' you, and what the rules are. These rules can range from the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_rule">one-drop rule<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and its relatives to mixes being recognized (which varies according to degree), and even strict <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrilineality">female<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineality">male<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> lines. This trope can be a particular problem when the father comes from a group that follows the matrilineal and the mother's people are patrilineal...and then there's the issues caused when the mixed-race individual is seen as 'proof' of their parents' being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CategoryTraitor">category traitors</a>.
</li><li> There is also the factor that if both sides of the family were their respective nations' royalty or nobility it may be much less likely to be a problem, but not always.
</li><li> Drifts all over the place with Eurasians in the Indian subcontinent. Those born to white mothers in mixed-race couples were typically given the one drop rule treatment while those born to British fathers occupied a special mid-tier between colonials and natives. After the 1857 sepoy mutiny, Eurasians of patrilineal descent faced distrust from both sides and their opportunities became severely restricted. Post Independence, however, saw Eurasian communities being given protected status in Indias equivalent of affirmative action.
</li></ul></li><li> Jamaican singer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/BobMarley">Bob Marley</a> was half-white and was bullied about this during his childhood.
</li><li> In his autobiography, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MalcolmX">Malcolm X</a> mentions that his mother hated her light complexion to the point where part of the reason she married his father is because he was dark-skinned and would give her children some color and favored his siblings over him because he was light-skinned himself. Malcolm himself mentioned "hating every drop of white blood in me". Whether they each felt this way because of the color or because of how it came about—Malcolm's grandmother was raped by a white man— isn't clear.
</li><li> Mixed-race couples and their children were historically maligned in the U.S.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note323sb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note323sb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note323sb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Lynching a black man for marrying a white woman was not unheard of, and depending on the time period, they might have gone as far as to lynch her and any children she might have had with him as well.</span> to the point of it being illegal in many states for black people (or others such as Asians, in some cases) to marry a white person until <strong>1967</strong>. Also, since interracial romance and interracial sex were considered immoral, federal sex trafficking laws were routinely used to prosecute black men for being in consensual relationships with white women until the language was clarified to only apply to prostitution, sex slavery, statutory rape, rape, and pedophilia. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildOfTwoWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildOfTwoWorlds">Child of Two Worlds</a> trope didn't come into play as often because a mixed-race child was more likely to be rejected by both parent groups instead of just one or the other.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeghanMarkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MeghanMarkle">Meghan Markle</a> described going through this personally and professionally. Even now, white detractors of her marriage to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheBritishRoyalFamily">Prince Harry</a> makes it clear that they still consider her black, as evidenced by the slurs leveled at them—including a neo-Nazi group deeming Harry a "race traitor" and calling for his assassination—while black detractors snidely suggest that the only reason she snagged him is because of how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButNotTooBlack">light-skinned she is</a> and that she would never have had a chance had she been darker.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrazyRichAsians">Crazy Rich Asians</a></em> star <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryGolding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HenryGolding">Henry Golding</a> has gone through this, lamenting that he's had to deal with white people mistreating him for being half-Asian and Asian people mistreating him for being half-white. In fact, some people criticized his casting in the film for the latter reason.
</li><li> Mixed ancestry isn't strictly necessary to be considered a "half-breed." Even pure-blooded immigrants (or their descendants) who refuse to ghettoize tend to end up shunned by a significant portion of the culture they came from and the culture they've adopted. Simply being born to a couple of mixed <em>cultural</em> ancestry (but the same race) can result in prejudice.
</li><li> Roman general Flavius Stilicho (who was considered one of the most powerful men during the last days of Rome) was the son of a Vandal father and a Roman mother. Despite his mixed heritage, there is little to suggest that he identified himself as anything other than Roman and a Christian as Christianity was the state religion of the Roman Empire at that point in contrast to the Vandals that practiced German paganism or Arianism, but that didn't stop his political rivals from accusing him of duplicity. In fact, this is one of the reasons that led to his downfall as his military failures against Vandals were viewed as him working with enemies against Rome, leading to Stilicho's execution.
</li><li> Comedian and host of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheDailyShow">The Daily Show</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrevorNoah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TrevorNoah">Trevor Noah</a>, experienced this in his childhood. He's spoken and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BornaCrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BornaCrime">written about</a> how his Xhosa mother and Swiss father's relationship had to be kept a secret, because during apartheid in South Africa it was illegal to be in an interracial relationship, though Trevor notes that his mother would've gotten a worse punishment than his father. Then Trevor was born, and he remembers how both Afrikaners and Black Africans would think of him as "half-caste", "mixed-breed", or even a "mutt". One of the things he remembers is that if he was walking down the street with his parents, he and his mother would walk on one side of the road and his father on the other. His mother would also have to avoid holding his hand in public in fear that a policeman would suspect something. Trevor's mere existence was dangerous, because if the white police noticed that he was mixed race, they would realize that his mother had an illegal relationship with his father.
