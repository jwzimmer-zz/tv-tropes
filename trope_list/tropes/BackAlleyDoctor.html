This could be for any number of reasons, from the surgeon having his license revoked, to actually being denied one in the first place, or (if you're lucky) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessForeignDegree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessForeignDegree">he simply got it in the wrong country.</a> One or more patients in the past may have died on his operating table due to improper procedures, mistakes, or lack of proper sanitation. Chances are they still do. Even so, he still gets a lot of business, simply because he never asks any questions. He does, however, expect you to do the same.
</p><p>The Back Alley Doctor typically operates in a dimly lit, grungy, back-alley office, complete with nightmarish surgical tools which may or may not have been recently cleaned. Sterilization is optional, often involving cigarette lighters, hot plates, or that bottle of whiskey he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickNip" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuickNip">sipping on</a> all day, including during the surgery. The whiskey is likely to double as a pain-killer and is safer than any pills he may have on hand.

A Back Alley Doctor funded by organized crime might have as good or better equipment and practices than a legit doctor.
</p><p>On the other hand, he may feature in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia">Dystopia</a> where he fell afoul of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrat</a> at best. His poverty may be the only problem in getting the best in medical treatment — well, that and the danger of getting busted.

</p><p>If more skilled, the Back Alley Doctor may provide plastic surgery as a means to hide the character's identity. Can cross with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenHeartDentistry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpenHeartDentistry">Open Heart Dentistry</a> if one of the reasons he's not a doctor is that he was trained in a completely different medical field; veterinarians working on humans is a common occurrence.

None of them recognized anyone that looked like Mello as Linda had drawn him years ago (that drawing being the only image of Mello they have). It is not known who treated Mello's burns or how, although popular <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpilepticTrees">fan theory</a> (particularly among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YaoiFangirl">Yaoi Fangirls</a>) is that it was his companion, Matt, who is not known to have any medical knowledge or training.
</li><li> Shinra Kishitani from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em>. He <em>is</em> a competent surgeon, though, and wouldn't have any problem getting a license (aside from his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableAge">Improbable Age</a>, that is), if he ever cared to.

Apparently, as Ikebukuro is a somewhat upscale district, even Back Alley Doctors charge a pretty penny there. Or perhaps due to being the local medic for all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza">Yakuza</a> in Ikebukuro, able to handle bullet removals and other "necessary repairs," on the spot, on the quiet, no questions asked, confidentiality guaranteed,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1y9hy');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1y9hy" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1y9hy');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">In other words, by calling on him, they avoid hospitals and thus exposure to the police while keeping valuable gangsters alive.</span> he gets paid well.

What she does frequently (and we do mean frequently) goes beyond the pale. But she can do things that are medically impossible, so people keep seeking her out.
</li><li> Dr. Daisuke Ido from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Gunnm">Gunnm</a></em> is an unusually sympathetic and competent one; he <em>was</em> a licensed doctor back on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FloatingContinent">Tiphares</a> and knows perfectly well what he's doing, but he currently lives in a near-lawless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCity">Mega City</a> on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AfterTheEnd">post-apocalyptic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthThatWas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthThatWas">Earth That Was</a>, so it's hard for him to be anything <em>but</em> a Back-Alley Doctor. Still, he's devoted to practicing medicine, and is practically the closest thing to a proper doctor that the Scrapyard has.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ">Heat Guy J</a></em>, there is an illegal doctor known as "Sensei," who wears a shirt with a skull-and-crossbones on it. He's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">Jerk with a Heart of Gold</a> who's always willing to help <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Daisuke</a> and adopted a little girl he found and trained her as a nurse. For a Back Alley Doctor with a rather gruff disposition (and an implied drinking problem), he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer">good at what he does</a>, as competent as an actual licensed doctor.
</li><li> <em>Injection Girl</em>: A preteen girl this time, who wants to become an idol singer, gets black market breast augmentation procedure from a back alley surgeon. As with the above, the <em>operation</em> goes fine, but the <em>results</em> were undesirable... not because they leak, but because they started <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreastExpansion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreastExpansion">swelling out of control</a> a few weeks later and he ends up turning her into his S&amp;M slave at the end.

He even has a glowing neon sign on his house describing him as such. He takes such pride in this that when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mako moves them up the ranks, he goes by "Front-Alley Doctor." When he becomes the medical officer for the Nudist Beach movement, the Infirmary door has a piece of paper taped to it that reads "Back-Alley"</span>

<ul><li> This RPG has street docs which appear to mostly be a subversion. Not only are they good enough to heal you but you can find ones that are good enough to modify you including <em>adding on to your brain to boost intellect</em>. However, the number one thing needed from these guys is loyalty so they don't decide to kill you/steal your organs and cyberware/turn you in for the sizable bounty/all of the above in any given order. Some of the Shadowrun sourcebooks make things a little more realistic and complex; there are good street docs and very very bad ones. They are also the only kind of doctor that is available to people without a SIN or can't afford Docwagon.
</li><li> An amusing yet disturbing anecdote in 4e's <em>Corporate Enclaves</em> supplement concerns a group of street docs so sloppy that they didn't even bother to clean their bone drill while installing a datajack. Which means, they did <em>brain surgery</em> with <em>unsterilized instruments</em>. Their hapless customer staggered into another street doc's office a day later with a "106-degree fever".

<ul><li> It worsens when you consider a body-chop-shop's no-questions-asked approach to acquiring cybernetic and bionic parts; quite apart from the hygiene and quality of the work and supplies (which the patient has no say in anyway) it has led to gangs who mug you and steal cyber-parts right out of you and leave you there, not caring whether you die or not, to sell the parts to the chop shop ("doctor, why do I get the feeling we've installed this eye three times today?"

</li><li> Also Dr. Zoidberg. While he did get into medical school, he probably got kicked out of there, because he has very little knowledge about human biology. Just look at some his quotes:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Zoidberg</strong>: So many years and so many strange fluids coming out of patient's bodies. <br/>- <br/><strong>Morgan</strong>: And <em>Doctor</em> Zoidberg, do you even have a medical degree? <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: I... lost it... into a volcano. <br/>- <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: What's your problem? <br/><strong>Fry</strong>: (impaled by a lead pipe) Well uh, my lead pipe hurts a little. <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: That's normal, next. <br/>- <br/><strong>Bender</strong>: Where are we, the ass? <br/><strong>Professor Farnsworth</strong>: We're in the heart, better known as the love muscle. <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: Where the food is digested! <br/>- <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: (looking at Leela's X-ray) Well, here's your problem right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head. <br/>- <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: I don't quite know how to say this... Fry is dead. <br/><em>Everyone Gasps</em> <br/><em>Fry Groans</em> <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: Wait, not dead, the other thing. <br/>- <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness. <br/><strong>Fry</strong>: But won't that crush my bones? <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones.
</div></li><li> Not to mention the Human Anatomy Chart in his office is <em>always</em> upside-down.
</li><li> Dr. Zoidberg's degree is actually in Art History.
<ul><li> A field in which he actually <em>is</em> competent.
</li></ul></li><li> He starts the series off with this gem:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Zoidberg</strong>: Now open your mouth... No not that one. <br/><strong>Fry</strong>: It's the only one I've got. <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: <em>Really?</em>
</div></li><li> Immediately followed up with
<div class="indent"><strong>Fry</strong>: Is there a human doctor around? <br/><strong>Zoidberg</strong>: Young lady, I am an expert on humans!
</div><ul><li> It's vaguely hinted a few times that Zoidberg is a perfectly fine physician when it comes to his own species, though.
</li></ul></li><li> In the Comedy Central seasons Hermes gets cyborg upgrades from a Russian surgeon who operates on his desk and uses his scalpels as darts. He's the gentleman pictured at the top of the page, scamming Fry out of his lungs.
</li></ul></li><li> Joked about on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em>: "I wouldn't have used that discount surgeon", and "That time we found out Meg's gynecologist didn't go to medical school" are the lead-ins.
<ul><li> Another one was one of the few references that didn't lead to a segue:
<div class="indent"><strong>Peter:</strong> You said the same thing about that back-alley abortionist. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you changed your mind, but the point is, I <em>found</em> the guy.
</div></li><li> Doctor Hartman is pretty much this, only somehow with a license, real or otherwise. He doesn't know what the human anatomy is called, and uses the books in his office as cheat-sheets. He also prescribed viagra as anti-depressants.
<div class="indent">Do you have any idea how expensive medical school is? I imagine it's pretty expensive!
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AquaTeenHungerForce">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a></em>, Shake gets a nose job in Guatemala. Later a guy (fresh from prison for back-alley surgery) in a van comes by to help reconstruct Shake's messed up face.
<ul><li> This may not be the same guy Carl visited to acquire a black-market secondhand brain for Meatwad.
<div class="indent"><strong>Meatwad</strong>: We callin' in the pros now. Is your buddy out of prison yet? <br/><strong>Carl</strong>: Which one? 'Cause there's three. <br/><strong>Meatwad</strong>: Oh, you know which one: The guy who was in the hotel... with the people... and the welding. <br/><strong>Carl</strong>: Oh, Terry. Yeah, he's out, but part of his parole is he's not supposed to, ya know, do what he was doing... to flesh.
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em>, Billy's dad Harold is depicted as a straight example in the episode <em>The Secret Snake Club VS P.E.</em>. Billy's classmates go to him to be excused from gym class by offering him fried food such as fried cheese sticks. Harold wouldn't give Billy any excuse because he wouldn't be a good father otherwise.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> has an episode in which Francine becomes one of these, working for the Cripple Mafia with her fellow doctor, a teddy bear. In the end, she gets out of her role with the mafia by tricking them into getting themselves all killed by police.
</li><li> Matthew Thorne from the appropriately-named <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> episode "Paging The Crime Doctor". He lost his license for not informing the police when he pulled a bullet out of his brother, notorious crime boss Rupert Thorne. He was relegated to a licenseless, back alley existence afterwards, mostly working for his brother. He eventually turns on his brother when Thorne tries to have Matthew's old college friend Leslie Thompkins killed after she (unwillingly) assisted Matthew in an operation to save Thorne's life, to keep her quiet.
<ul><li> Rupert Thorne finds he needs surgery after collapsing during one of his rants. The X ray reveals a tumor that will kill him if not removed. The surgeon begs him to go a real hospital but Rupert being an amoral crime boss insists that if it isn't done right then and there, it won't be done at all. The abovementioned surgeon agrees.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10UltimateAlien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a>,</em> it was not played even a little bit for comedy in the episode "Catch a Falling Star." A past villain wants <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPlasticSurgery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicPlasticSurgery">a new face</a>. He goes to a <em>veterinarian</em> who owes him a favor. The amount of blood found by the heroes later was apparently impressive. However, it's hard to be sure if they mean leftovers from the surgery or if it's from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch">what Nesmith did to the only guy who knew what he now looked like</a>. This episode is generally considered the height of the franchise's use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerebusSyndrome">Cerebus Syndrome</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllHailKingJulien">All Hail King Julien</a></em> has Doctor S, Rob McTodd's personal plastic surgeon. He claims that he doesn't need a medical license to practice medicine out of a cave, and for some reason, ends up being hired as the kingdom's official doctor. He frequently makes misdiagnosis and his practices resemble a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> more than a doctor.
<div class="indent"><strong>Doctor S</strong>: <em>(Regarding a line of patients)</em> Look at them Nurse Phantom, so many test subjects, and I don't even have to dig any of them up! <br/><strong>Hector</strong>: I don't know why I'm here, I'm in perfect health. <br/><strong>Doctor S</strong>: Not for long!

<ul><li> The Darwin Awards told a story of someone who had a back-alley liposuction procedure performed by his friend in his garage with <em>a vacuum cleaner</em>. Since it's the Darwin Awards, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive">you can guess the outcome</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The only surprising thing is that the cause of death was an overdose of the drugs the "doctor" gave him instead of from having some untrained moron stick a vacuum cleaner into his insides</span>.
</li><li> While hiding out in Buenos Aires, Josef Mengele continued to "practice medicine," specializing in illegal abortions and getting at least one patient killed.
</li><li> There was a case where <a class="urllink" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/20/butt-implants-fake-doc_n_1103933.html">a woman was giving people cheap butt implants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> made of cement, mineral oil, and tire sealant.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/witness-testifies-butt-injection-case-article-1.1179856">And she's not the only one, either.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> In general, there's always the advice to save up the money for cosmetic surgery, instead of cutting corners, as if the above stories aren't an indication, back-alley doctors are especially rife in the cosmetic surgeries field and it's even worse if one goes overseas to get said surgeries, as other countries have different regulations, so, what could be considered legit in one country would very well be back-alley in the US, if not sliding between the two.
</li></ul></li><li> In Kowloon Walled City in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HongKong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HongKong">Hong Kong</a>, there were quite a few dentists who may or may not have had qualifications. Often the conditions were unhygienic as well.
</li><li> Plague doctors during the Renaissance were primarily this. Most of them were failed doctors, aka they either were unable to pass medical school or had their licenses revoked. Despite that though, there is something a bit admirable about people who took on a job that, not only was the pay lousy for the time, but they had a very real chance of dying of plague themselves. Even so, they would try to help anyone that suffered from the black death. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_doctor#Public_servants">They were, however, not quite as discreet or illegal as most of the examples on this game since plague doctors were essentially hired by towns as public servants<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Considering the state of medical practice and knowledge at the time, they possibly weren't any worse than the other licensed doctors in practice either.
</li></ul></li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, combat medics were often recruited from enlistees whose only prior experience was handling knives as butchers or living on a farm. Some medics didn't even have <em>that</em> much experience. Fortunately, their purpose was more to keep casualties alive long enough to be taken to receive advanced care rather than operating on the wounded themselves...
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_Gosnell">Dr. Kermit Gosnell<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a former abortion doctor whose gross malpractice got him sentenced to life in prison without parole. The services he provided and conditions were very much like a typical back alley doctor, but in a "legitimate" institution. Note that Kermit Gosnell <em>did</em> have a legitimate license to practice. His employees, however...
</li><li> Linda Hazzard, whose "medical license" was dubious at best no thanks to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">loophole</a> that grandfathered in alternative medicine practitioners without degrees, set up a sanitorium where she promoted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment">fasting</a> as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Panacea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Panacea">Panacea</a> for all the body's ills. Not only that the regimen she gives to her <strike>victims</strike> patients sounds eerily similar to those suffered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHolocaust">concentration camp</a> prisoners<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7bojk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7bojk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7bojk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">As in her victims were starved to the point that they look like living corpses too weak to even do basic tasks, not to mention that Hazzard would beat the living daylights out of her clients purportedly to further "detox" them, reportedly yelling "Eliminate! Eliminate!!"</span>, she was also found to have forced them into signing their will, effectively swindling them to death. Hazzard was later convicted for her atrocities, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">only served two years jail time</a> and was even pardoned by Governor Ernest Lister. Ironically enough, even <em>she herself</em> was convinced by her own nonsense, eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">dying of starvation</a> in 1938 after attempting a fasting cure on herself.
</li><li> With the price of dental treatment being astronomically high, and with NHS dental charges shooting up to the point where even state-subsidised dental care is beyond the reach of many - to say nothing of the difficulty of finding a British dentist prepared to accept NHS patients - back-street dentistry is now a growing issue in Britain. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note82knr');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note82knr" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note82knr');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Paradoxically, a dental consultant called to give evidence in one trial found the unlicenced dentist's standards of work and general competence so good, that the only issue he had was that the man had never been to univeristy and had no licence to practice. He considered it a pity that a criminal record for practicing without a licence would prevent this person from formally training for the profession...</span>
