Prone to saying "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>" and being somewhat divorced from reality, especially when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">'the book'</a> contradicts common sense. Prone <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">to hog any credit for success</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">slough off any blame</a>, and often inordinately fond of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a>.

</li><li>Noncombatants (with or without a military background) commenting on actual military operations (as professional pundits or otherwise) or wargaming past military operations with other enthusiasts. Often have trouble telling the difference between the 'paper'/theoretical and 'actual' strength and performance of forces. Particularly prone to obsessing over the specifications of weapons and equipment and championing their favourites.

In ancient and tribal societies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">the best fighters were the ones who became commanders</a>. Also, in the days before professional soldiers were a thing, part of the job of a commander was to inspire their forces to fight. If applied to modern battlefields, however, this would definitely be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StraightForTheCommander">If the tactics expert who leads your army dies in the first volley</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitatedArmy">the chances are you're going to lose.</a> And even if he doesn't die, fighting with the troops is going to make it much harder for him to tell what's going on or relay orders.
</p><p>Note that Armchair <em>Admiral</em> is usually an averted trope. Admirals very often work on the warships, and capital ships are floating command centers. They thus share the same dangers as do any sailors, both combat-related and perils of nature. Other admirals instead work at naval headquarters on land.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patlabor_2:_The_Movie">Patlabor 2: The Movie,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> the civilian government and police act this way, undermine their control over the military, and allow the terrorists to attack Tokyo.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidenRose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MaidenRose">Maiden Rose</a></em>, every administration that we see has its own armchair military. In Vol. 2 the brass from Taki's country are particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">obstructive</a> and serve as a contrast to the type of frontline leader Taki is.
</li><li> Lelouch pointedly averts this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>. "If a general does not lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?" While he isn't necessarily on the <em>front</em> lines, he is personally present at nearly every battle he commands. He takes this philosophy to such an extreme that his chess strategies often involve the king being right out with the rest of the pieces, making offensive moves.
<ul><li> Hilariously this doesn't or barely works since his troops are prone to threatening him and running if the battle isn't going in their favor. This is why Lelouch turns the Black Knights into a military force because in his second major battle his troops ran. In the third major battle? They would've ran beforehand but Lelouch the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">Magnificent Bastard</a> that he is told them they had no choice but to fight and threatened to kill himself and leave them helpless when they threatened mutiny.
</li></ul></li><li> Yuna Roma Seiran of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEEDDestiny">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny</a></em> thinks he's a brilliant strategist because of his experience with war games. In practice, he makes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a> Lord Djibril (who at least has a certain <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">ruthless</a><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill">ness</a> to commend him) look brilliant.
<ul><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Mobile Suit Gundam SEED</a></em> by Captain William Sutherland, a General Staff officer notable for both his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">banality</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a>-crossing strategies. Sutherland seems like an armchair admiral who can only recommend the strategies he does because he's never actually seen combat. Yet in the final episodes it's Sutherland who leads the attack on ZAFT from aboard his flagship, the <em>Doolittle</em>; it quickly becomes apparent that he uses the tactics he does not because he is ignorant, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">because he has no regard for human life</a>.
</li><li> Muruta Azrael also counts he sits back and watches the carnage his forces unleash, but should things go wrong he starts throwing hissy fits to the one in charge, and he demands his forces to keep on attacking no matter what.
</li></ul></li><li> General Damon from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyriaChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyriaChronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a></em> and his top brass commanders never take part of the fighting itself, show <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">racism to Darcen soldiers</a>, and overall are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">terrible commanders</a>. It's no wonder that they are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">rather unpopular among fans</a>.
</li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em> plays with this in the form of Gihren Zabi, the son of Sovereign Degwin Zabi, and Supreme Commander of Zeon's forces. A definitive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionBigBad">Non-Action Big Bad</a>, Gihren has, unlike his brothers and sister, never seen combat. He's also a totally ruthless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">psychopath</a> who has no problems with throwing away the lives of his soldiers. At the same time, however, Gihren is also reasonably competent, organising the war effort, leaving the tactical and operational decisions to his siblings, and holding the country together through his genuine skills as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RousingSpeech">an orator</a>. It's not until near the end of the war that some of his strategic mistakes actually begin to catch up with him.
<ul><li> What makes this even worse is that Gihren has a bunch of fanatic fanboys, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam0083StardustMemory">Delaz and Gato</a>, who hang on his every word and would die for his cause. This is particularly bad concerning this trope as Delaz ends up pulling out his fleet when Gihren is killed, considering the (possibly) more experienced Kycillia a waste of time, though that is more due to the fact that she <em>killed</em> him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em> the higher-ranking members of the Police Brigade are seen slacking off, forcing the new recruits to do all the dirty work.

Misato shows him Lilith, the Angels' objective, housed beneath NERV, and explains that if the Angels were ever to reach Lilith, all human life on the planet would end. She goes on to say that, therefore, NERV's command staff is hardly "safe": if Shinji and the other Eva pilots were to fail in their mission, <em>everyone</em> will die anyway, so they're all risking their lives together. This manages to convince Shinji.

Not only do the royal Vinsmokes command their armies, but they directly participate in their battles as well.
</li><li> The army of Midland in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em> is commanded by a totally clueless ring of pompous noblemen. They spend more time arguing over who should get the "honor" of heading campaigns than they do discussing actual viable strategies. This allows Griffith to step in and gain considerable social status through, well, actual military merit.

While Optimus and Megatron often lead from the front (and tear both grunts and each other apart), a few cons talk of one battle where both of them were sealed inside rooms and had sensory feeds of every one of their soldiers fed directly into their brains to better coordinate the battlefield. One con remarks that thousands of lives were turned into statistics as the two leaders sat in their chairs (minds strained to the limit) directing everything. There is no further recording of this practice. Most bot and con leaders tend to avert this, and the one who comes closest to playing it straight is Prowl, who relies on lots of behind the scenes manipulation to get tasks done (he even made a secret behind-the-scenes task force to eliminate threats), but he can normally be seen taking up arms and directing on the battlefield.

In the first couple of seasons nobody ever had to deal with a Stargate in the modern age for such a long period of time, leading to many mistakes.
<ul><li> The best example, however, is the IOA. They make a lot of decisions that aren't logical at all.
<ul><li> It's frequently pointed out in later seasons of SG-1 and Atlantis that the IOA, when faced with a difficult decision, will deliberate until after the deadline so that someone else can make the decision and they can criticize it. While the operating principle behind the IOA is sound (civilian oversight of military operations), they are so incredibly ineffectual as to be criminally negligent.

The <em>Odyssey</em> dead in space, a Replicator Queen churning out little bugs, while four Ori cruisers take turns shooting it.

<ul><li> While the first three seasons do make a few jokes about armchair generals across history (particularly the third one), the fourth and final season is entirely devoted to this trope. It is basically a magnificent take-that towards ruthless, uncaring military commanders who lead from behind and forget that they're sending people to fight and die.

After Blackadder's latest plan to get away from the front (by feigning insanity) fails, he decides to call in a favor from Field Marshal Haig, the British Commander-in-Chief, for saving his life years ago.

<div class="indent">Generals don't smash chairs over people's heads. They don't get Newcastle Brown bottles, stick them in your face and say, "Stitch that, Jimmy." Generals are in the nice, white tent on the hill, sipping Sancerre, directing the battle. They're men of honour.

He's the one who represents the Admiralty, sends Captain Pellew's <em>Indefatigable</em> and three other ships to sail to France, but he himself stays in London. He does not abort the mission when a copy of General Charette's plan gets stolen, probably by spies, and very likely falls to enemy hands. He also insists that General Charette should not be informed about the incident. Pellew is disgusted that men (and among those are his <em>own</em> men for whose lives he feels responsible) are sent to die in a doomed mission.
</li><li> The Danish politicians in <em>1864</em> are portrayed as this, especially the semi-insane, obese Prime Minister D.G. Monrad, who speaks continuously of the Danish People's "will to fight," while continuously ordering the horrendously outnumbered and outgunned Danish conscript army to stand against the overwhelming forces of Imperial Germany. He even rapturously applauds the PTSD-induced <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell">War Is Hell</a> stories of his son, making him both this trope and something of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatBastard">Fat Bastard</a> .

This somehow succeeds despite losses that are horrifically high <em>for the Imperial Guard</em> and gets Chenkov another medal for every gruesome victory. To his credit, Chenkov does not simply order a few thousand more recruits and call it a day- he's right there on the field to participate in killing the Emperor's enemies and "encourage" his troopers (it's said that his bolt pistol has felled more cowards than it has heretics).

<ul><li> When Father Elijah was Elder of the local Brotherhood of Steel chapter, he was every bit this; he insisted on trying to hold HELIOS One against the NCR despite the fact that they were outnumbered and dying in droves, and the only reason they survived at all was because they pulled a coup and removed him from leadership. Many cite the reason for his failure as having been a Scribe (scientist) before becoming an Elder, whereas most Elders are chosen from the ranks of Paladins (soldiers with considerable front-line experience). However, when you encounter him at the Sierra Madre, it becomes clear that the problem runs much deeper; Elijah is in fact a complete sociopath who treats people as though they are machines, or resources, that can be used and discarded.

When the admiral tries to once again claim that the Federation doesn't need them, Picard comes back and asks the admiral point-blank if he's ever been to the frontier, which is very much more dangerous than that admiral's cushy office.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> was almost exclusively fought by armchair generals, officers whose only experience was in wars vastly dissimilar to the realities of trench warfare. Generals would constantly order massive offensives against prepared defenses, despite the fact that trenches and machine guns rendered mass assaults not just useless but horribly lethal to the attackers. Battles would claim as many as a million casualties in exchange for neglible gains.
<ul><li> Germany's offensive was the Schlieffen Plan, an ambitious circling maneuver intended to outflank Paris and force the French army to fight in places they weren't prepared for. However, it was highly dependent on constant movement and didn't make much allowance for delays, of which there were many. The General Staff's insistence on maintaining this plan in spite of the experiences of troops on the ground led to trench warfare which would dominate the remainder of the war.
</li><li> In 1917, roughly half the French army mutinied (technically, as they still manned the trenches and would defend) and refused to participate in any more offensive action over their disgust with armchair generals who would order attacks in all defiance of logic (refusing to cancel attacks after outside forces like weather and botched artillery bombardments derailed the original attack plan). After new generals replaced the old ones, the French discontinued offensives for the remainder of the war.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeKingdomsShuWeiWu">Three Kingdoms</a> had a number of these:
<ul><li> When forces of the state of Wu arrived to assist Zhuge Dan, a general rebelling against their rival state of Wei, the Wu general Zhu Yi found himself driven back by the Wei forces. The Wu regent Sun Chen arrived and gave Zhu Yi reinforcements, ordering him to break the Wei lines to rescue Zhuge Dan. Zhu Yi was again driven back, and the main Wu supply depot destroyed to boot. Sun Chen ordered another attack, but Zhu Yi protested, pointing out his men were exhausted and they had no food left. Sun Chen angrily had Zhu Yi beaten to death and tried to order another attack, but Wu's morale completely collapsed and he was forced to withdraw.
</li><li> Zhuge Liang was a brilliant civil official, but upon being made Prime Minister of Shu he saw himself as a military man. However, while well-read and somewhat experienced (he'd participated in military operations as part of Liu Bei's army), he was stubborn and unable to adapt to the chaotic and fluid nature of a real life battlefield. His plans made sense on paper, but his major flaw was his inability to change them, leading to him sticking to his plans long after the situation on the ground made them impossible. The fact that he was up against talented and experienced generals like Cao Zhen and Sima Yi didn't help.
</li></ul></li><li> Another famous case from China is Zhao Kuo. His family, after failing to convince the king of Zhao of his incompetence, made the king promise he would not punish them should the man fail, and the king kept his word... even after the guy's inexperience <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Changping">cost him half a million men in a crushing defeat inflicted by the state of Qin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. It is also from Zhao's story whereby the Chinese idiom for this trope (纸上谈兵 "zhi shang tan bing", literally "talking about warfare on paper") came about.
</li><li> Prior to the US-led <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">invasion of Iraq</a>, the clash of ideals between General Eric Shinseki and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was like this. Shinseki's ideas were based on established military doctrine on how to control a country such as Iraq, while Rumsfeld's thoughts were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssPull">pulled out of his ass</a>. Rumsfeld simply didn't understand that defeating Iraq's military was the easy part, controlling Iraq's people enough so Iraq could be rebuilt was the difficult part. Rumsfeld also either fully believed in (or actually helped create, depending on your viewpoint) the Bush Administration's view that a war against Iraq would be quick and easy, much to the annoyance of military men who remembered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheVietnamWar">the last time</a> the United States invaded a country and had to deal with hostile locals.
</li><li> General Colin Powell had a run-in with then-Secretary of State Madeline Albright during the planning for intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Powell kept stressing the need for a specific endgame and exit strategy <em>before</em> any military force was applied, having learned this bitter lesson during his combat service in Vietnam. Albright angrily asked him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhenAllYouHaveIsAHammer">why bother having such a powerful military if it wasn't going to be used</a>. Powell later stated that he had to take a moment <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">to rein in his emotions</a>.
</li><li> Quite a large number of self-proclaimed "neo-conservatives" have been named "chickenhawks" for their support of war as a foreign policy tool while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraftDodging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DraftDodging">having gone to some length to avoid military service themselves</a>. Liberal bloggers have also adopted the "chairborne" terminology, as well as referring to "the 101st Fighting Keyboards" and the like.
</li><li> As a lighter example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">Interservice Rivalry</a>, the US Air Force is frequently referred to as the "Chair Force" by the uniformed personnel of other branches. Airmen have also been known to toss the term around themselves, typically from pilots of regular manned aircraft to pilots of UAVs. Ironically, in the Air Force, it's <em>only</em> the officers who are supposed to get shot at — unless one is in Combat Control or Pararescue.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was halfway to this trope. While he did have combat experience, he only made it to the rank of Corporal before taking the reins of the largest army in Europe. While Hitler did come up with some effective strategies, he greatly overestimated his military acumen. The fact that he had made a lucky guess regarding his disposition of forces during the French invasion<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0i74b');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0i74b" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0i74b');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">and in fact many of the successes happened because his generals <em>ignored</em> his orders to stop the advance</span> gave him the impression that he was a closet military genius, which would color many of his decisions throughout the remainder of the war.
</li><li> Stalin also qualified, combined with a severe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a>. Fortunately for him and his troops, he was smart enough to acknowledge this (to himself, not to his troops) and eventually (after the disastrous loss of millions of soldiers) listened to the advice of his generals, and focused more on the political and strategic objectives of the war while leaving tactical decisions to them. Not that this stopped him from being proclaimed "generalissimo" and the "military genius" who won the war anyway.
<ul><li> In an interesting turn of events, he and Hitler seemed to switch roles as the war progressed, with Stalingrad marking the turning point for both: after Stalingrad, Hitler became more involved in tactical decisions which only led to further defeats, while Stalin stopped meddling with battle plans and allowed his generals to do their job.
</li></ul></li><li> President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DwightDEisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> never actually served in combat. He did face criticism for that from military leaders at the time (including George S. Patton), but he's still one of the most decorated military leaders in modern history and served in the military for over forty years, both before and after his presidency. This is justified, though, in that his position as Supreme Allied Commander required more skill in politics (getting headstrong commanders from numerous countries to work together) than leading troops.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> had been described as such during his command in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheKoreanWar">The Korean War</a>, for never spending a night on Korean soil and issuing his orders from the relative safety of Tokyo. Ironically, during his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSoldier">previous 50 years of service in the US Army</a>, he had been the opposite, the one to risk his life even unnecessarily, as in the scouting mission in Mexico and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> in Europe. Enough to have impressed <em>Patton</em> in 1918.
<ul><li> During the New Guinea campaign, he never went to the front lines, which resulted in him repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss">sacking</a> commanders who he felt were slacking off, when they were actually trying their damndest to get through the worst terrain in the world. On at least two occasions, this resulted in the replacement getting credit for a victory the previous commander had been on the verge of winning.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">US Army</a> slang for this is "Chairborne Ranger," after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">75th Ranger Regiment's</a> nickname of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsRainingMen">Airborne</a> Rangers" It's also used as a term for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoldiersAtTheRear">Soldiers at the Rear</a>, but it's more often used to derisively describe civilians talking about what the military "should" be doing.
<ul><li> The more common term for soldiers at the rear is REMF - that is, Rear Echelon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrecisionFStrike">Mother Fucker</a>.
</li><li> In recent years, since around 2008, the favorite term, popular in Infantry and similiar units, is POG, said like "Pogue," person other than grunt.
<ul><li> It's a bit older than that, though to be honest some POG's actually go deeper than Infantry — like ELINT, who often operate behind enemy lines, with short range antennaes on the back of a humvee.
</li></ul></li><li> Another, much more affectionate, replacement for "REMF" is "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHobbit">FOBbits</a>", soldiers who rarely leave the <em>F</em>orward <em>O</em>perating <em>B</em>ase. (The affection has much to do with the fact that physical security of FOBs was good during the Iraq and Afganistan Wars, thanks in part to FOBbits being somewhat more on the ball than the REMFs of the Vietnam War.)
</li><li> Bill Mauldin called them Garritroopers — "too far forward to shave, too far back to get shot."
</li></ul></li><li> In Ireland, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a> sparked what is sometimes known as "Armchair Republicanism" or "Armchair IRA"; people who live in the Republic who claim to be massive supporters of the IRA's activities in the North. Even to this day with the peace process having quelled the worst elements of the conflict, there are those in the Republic, many of whom have never had family involved let alone set foot in the north, who proclaim that they are diehard Nationalists while never doing a thing about it.
</li><li> The rise of the Internet has led to a veritable explosion in the second type by lowering the cost of entry and allowing every Tom, Dick, and Harry with a keyboard and Internet connection to voice their opinion.
<ul><li> Bizarrely enough, this actually has yielded some positive results in the war against terror. Amateur sleuths on 4chan got together, analysed propaganda videos taken by Islamist terrorists and determined the location of troops of the Islamic State terror organisation by comparing the video footage with pictures on Google Maps, then sent the information to the Russian military via a savvy junior officer, who convinced his superiors of its validity. They promptly decided to bomb the sites to oblivion. This kind of thing has been confirmed to have happened at least twice.
