</div></div><p>Some people are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">a magnet of fortune</a>. Some people are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">constantly beaten up by it</a>. Then there's these guys.
</p><p>Some characters seem to live in a strange limbo of fortune: They are constantly finding themselves trapped in awful situations, many times without even trying. This would be seen from almost any perspective as rotten luck; but despite all that they always manage to come out of all those problems without a scratch, much less troubled than any reasonable person would expect, or even with the upper hand.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>From another perspective: These people have an amazing ability to come clean out of any sort of pickle thrown at them, no matter how unlikely the chances or ludicrous the way. Anyone would say Lady Fortune has them under her wing, except that there's the little fact that they always get themselves into those sorts of situations in the first place, and in fact seem to attract them like honey to bees.
</p><p>Are they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a>? Are they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornUnlucky">Born Unlucky</a>? It's hard to say. Friends, enemies, and even they themselves will be hard-pressed to give a straight answer. Answers will probably lean towards the lucky side, since no matter what they still come out alive out of anything; just don't expect that to mean much while they are knee-deep into yet another trouble.
</p><p>Note that characters that are lucky in some aspects and unlucky in other completely different ones do not qualify under this trope. The main factor here is that their luck and unluck are at odds in the same circumstances.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnneHappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AnneHappy">Anne Happy</a></em>: Main character Anne Hanakoizumi, a.k.a. "Hanako" is incredibly unlucky, to the point that her "luck" measures in the negative. Despite, or possibly because of this, she very frequently experiences surprisingly lucky, even miraculous, events. For instance, her luck class's first assignment is to carry an egg for a day without it breaking. It was expected that, since everyone in the class was unlucky, no one would succeed. However, not only did Hanako succeed, the near-expired store-bought egg hatched a healthy chick in the middle of class.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk">Berserk</a></em>: Despite living what seems like a life cursed by fate, every misfortune in Guts' life is accompanied by some stroke of luck or fateful encounter that enables him to endure it, if only just barely, and prevents his hope from dying.
<ul><li> Concerning his childhood: He was an orphan the moment he was born, but he was discovered by Sys and saved from dying beneath his mother's corpse. Sys died and Gambino abused him while making him fight as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier">Child Soldier</a>, but he survived and developed precocious talent as a warrior. He killed Gambino in self-defense and got wounded while escaping, collapsing by the side of the road, but another troupe of mercenaries happened to pass by and take him in before he died of exposure.
</li><li> In the Golden Age Arc, he got in a fight with Griffith and received a wound that almost killed him, but he had impressed Griffith so much that he ordered Guts to be nursed back to health, and offered him a job when he woke up. He had the rotten luck of encountering Zodd the Immortal, and later Wyald, but the former he survived because his destiny was entwined with Griffith's, and the latter because by that point he was pretty much the ultimate fighter. The Eclipse—in which he was betrayed by his best friend, got branded as a demon sacrifice, had all his companions devoured by monsters, and lost his left hand and right eye while being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedToWatch">Forced to Watch</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the rape of Casca, his true love</span>—gave him reason to curse the day he was ever born. AND YET: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> he and Casca are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheUnderworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RescuedFromTheUnderworld">Rescued from the Underworld</a> by the Skull Knight just in the nick of time</span>, meaning that he basically survived by cheating death and the laws of causality.
</li><li> It only gets crazier from there. Long story short, Guts' life is painful and miserable, but if his luck keeps up there will always be a silver lining.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheGeniusPrincesGuideToRaisingANationOutOfDebtHeyHowAboutTreason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheGeniusPrincesGuideToRaisingANationOutOfDebtHeyHowAboutTreason">The Genius Prince's Guide to Raising a Nation Out of Debt (Hey, How About Treason?)</a></em>'s Wein is essentially anime version of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a> (see below). His various attempts to sell out his nation in order to retire comfortably or at least trying to avoid trouble in order to stop his country's cashflow problem or getting dragged into international conflicts always spiral out of control due to uncontrollable external factors, but the combination of his skill and sheer luck, he manages to not only comes out alive, but his nation benefits and his reputation is enhanced...which makes fulfilling his goal of selling his country even harder.
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GreatTeacherOnizuka">Great Teacher Onizuka</a></em> is sometimes this. In one example from the anime, he comes across a large bag of money (that's good), which he spends all at once. It turns out the money was the school's field trip funds, which was planted on him in order to frame him for embezzling (that's bad). He somehow manages to convince the school not to fire him (that's good), but only by pledging an even more expensive field trip which he can't possibly afford (that's bad). He then fails to earn anything near the amount needed, only to win a car in an unrelated lottery (that's good). He then lends the car to a complete stranger, with no guarantees that the stranger will return it on time, if ever (that's bad). The stranger turns out to have been hired by the person trying to frame Onizuka (that's bad), but has a change of heart and returns the car anyway (that's good). At the last possible minute, naturally.
</li><li> Guido Mista from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Vento Aureo</a>. In his backstory, he saved a woman who was about be raped, and when the rapist and his criminal partners tried to shoot him, they all missed their shots, so much that Mista had the time to take one of their guns, reload, and shoot them back while staying still under their fire (and this was <em>before</em> Mista gained his Stand ability to redirect bullets). However, this story was claimed too unbelievable by the jury and was condemned for 15 years of prison. This story caught the attention of Bruno Bucciarati, a gangster who was looking for potential Stand users, and got him out of jail and a job that payed well and that he was good at. Afterwards, most of his fights ended up having at an element of unluckiness, but he always manages to get out alive and/or with some advantage on the long run. Fans have taken note of how he ends up fighting people who can redirect his bullets back at him one way or another, to the point that by the time the battle ends, his body is usually completely riddled with bullet holes, yet he usually does win in the end.
</li><li> Touma Kamijou of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> is extremely unlucky, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiMagic">Imagine Breaker</a> power in his right arm cancelling out the good fortune he would otherwise receive. However, it also negates the powers of both <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicVersusScience">magicians and espers</a>. He has the bad luck of getting dragged into battle against powerful members of both factions, but also the good luck of having the power to defeat them.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MedakaBox">Medaka Box</a></em>: Kumagawa Misogi is repeatedly referred to as the weakest person in the world. His inability to win is also repeatedly remarked upon. However, due to his knowledge of both these facts, he can always turn his losses into benefits to screw over others. And despite his label as the weakest, this just means that he is aware of the the weaknesses of everyone. This makes him capable of taking down nearly any opponent other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> and some exceptionally powerful beings.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFool">Monkey D. Luffy</a> is really this instead of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a>. Its just that he's so optimistic and thrill-seeking that the bad situations he gets into are exciting rather than horrifying for him.
<ul><li> One example is in the Impel Down arc, where he and his allies find themselves falling into a vat of molten lava. However, the alternative would have been them getting caught on their way down to the fourth level by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImplacableMan">Warden</a>, so this ultimately was the better option (not that they could appreciate that).
</li><li> And then there's his escape from the Buggy Pirates on the way to the Grand Line. While it's seen as <em>the</em> example of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornLucky">Born Lucky</a> status, in actuality all it did was put him in the hands of Smoker, who would probably have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFateWorseThanDeath">put him</a> in the above mentioned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcatraz">Impel Down</a>. Even when he is rescued from that situation, he is thrust into a giant storm that, without the quick thinking of his crew, would have sunk them all.
</li><li> Luffy and his crew's tendency to end up in horribly dangerous situations and getting out of them has culminated in him <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">unwittingly gaining the allegiance of a massive alliance of pirate crews, the friendship of multiple kingdoms' royal families, and being designated as the <strong>Fifth Emperor</strong>.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombielandSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ZombielandSaga">Zombieland Saga</a></em> has Ai Mizuno, who was unlucky enough to get hit by lightning TWICE in the exact same circumstances (performing during a storm in front of loads of fans). The first time kills her. The second, well... it turns out that for zombies, being hit by lightning autotunes their voices, makes them glow, and lets them shoot (harmless) lasers from their fingers. The audio/video effects prove so awesome that she and her band are skyrocketed into popularity.

The clumsiest, most unlucky Jedi of his generation, he manages to survive the massacre of his fellow Padawans by simple virtue of arriving late to the knighting ceremony made by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor">Evil Mentors</a>.

<div class="indent"><strong>Zayne:</strong> The Force does not want me dead. It doesn't want me happy, but it doesn't want me dead.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/JimmyOlsen">Jimmy Olsen</a>, even in his more competent iterations, is a world-class <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessMagnet">Weirdness Magnet</a> with a tendency to get into major trouble as a result. However, except for a few occasions, he always comes out with nary a scratch or even angst.
</li><li> In Marvel, Rick Jones is a lot like Jimmy Olsen. But then, he's always partially blamed himself for Bruce Banner being turned into the Hulk, and tries to help him (both Banner <em>and</em> the Hulk) as a result; this tends to make the nature of his luck (good versus bad) ebb and flow.
</li><li> The Water Wizard (now called Aqueduct) was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IneffectualSympatheticVillain">Ineffectual Sympathetic Villain</a> just like everyone who was invited to meet at the Bar with No Name during the original "Scourge of the Underworld" story in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a>'s comic. But he missed the meeting when his car blew a flat tire. He was upset at what he thought was just more bad luck at the time, but could only say prayers of thanks — and turn himself in for his own safety — when he found out that everyone who <em>did</em> make the meeting was ambushed and murdered by Scourge.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo">Scooby-Doo</a></em> #20 (Gold Key, July 1973) had a story titled "Unlucky Luck", where Velma tries to break Scooby and Shaggy of being superstitious. She has Fred and Daphne plant a ladder and a black cat along a designated path on which she has Scooby and Shaggy follow as part of a game. Of course, they're hesitant, until crossing each bad luck path results in some fortune—a wallet full of money and boxes of candy and dog biscuits. Velma thinks her plan has worked until Scooby and Shaggy go back for their luck talismans—they think if that was bad luck they had, just think of how much good luck they'll have now.
</li><li> Martin Soap in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher">The Punisher</a></em> suffers misfortune after misfortune throughout his time in the series.

His ex-girlfriend cursed him with "the misfortune of the coyote", but because Setback interpreted this through the lens of cartoons, that manifests as him periodically getting massive surges of <em>good</em> luck to counterbalance the endless low-key disaster montage that is his life. For example, it meant that after having the bad luck to stumble into one of Baron Blade's super-serum tests, he had the <em>good</em> luck to have it actually work and not mutate him horribly or kill him... meaning that he now has the strength and durability to survive an extended career of pratfalls onto marauding war engines, falling off roofs while fighting rat monsters, and otherwise putting his foot in it. In play, Setback tends to have turns of little achievement or even hurting himself or emptying his pool by random chance...and other turns where he hits harder than almost any other hero, bounces from near-death to full health instantly, draws a giant hand of cards or gives everyone a round of free power uses.

A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingDisasterArea">Walking Disaster Area</a>, his adventures always attract some nastiness along the way; falling architecture, stupidly uneven firefights, exploding vehicles, or the occasional supernatural threat to name a few. While this makes him severely question his luck, his uncanny ability to dodge everything thrown at him (including the bullets), have stuff fall in just the right place, or, in the worst cases, survive and fight with injuries that would kill any other man in seconds, has given him fame amongst his friends as a lucky bastard. In fact, while he keeps getting into firefights, his "health" meter is stated by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> to be actually a "luck" meter, meaning until a player dies, he <em>isn't</em> shot, but is narrowly missed instead.

He reacts with noticeable surprise when his Level 3 Super happens, and it's one of the odd supers that puts the user in some danger. He's the only one not affected by the mutation of El Dorado, and turning what would be a horrible situation for anyone else completely around is the intention with successfully pulling off the whole super.

Cursed with god-awful luck from mild (never once winning at the lottery) to the downright absurd and life-threatening (lightning strikes, poisoned food and being mistaken for a bandit), you'd think that the stuff he survives will land him in an eleven-foot hole, but he brushes off <em>falling off cliffs</em> like it's a small cold. He certainly has bad luck due to his tendency to get into these situations, but his ability to survive situations that would kill most people cements him in this territory.

She was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbuse">beaten</a>, but not so badly that she couldn't steal the food she needed to survive. She was betrayed, but slavemasters showed up at just the right time to distract the person attempting to murder her. She was caught by bandits, but they decided to sell her instead of killing her. She caught the plague, and then was betrayed <strong>again</strong>, but her sickness was still in its early stages, so she was able to kill the guy in self-defense. And then she was caught by guards and sentenced to be lashed for every person she'd murdered, but somehow they got the count wrong, so her death came a lot slower than it 'should' have. And then she actually died for real, but an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> conscripted her into helping it destroy the world.

Not only do his cases hit rock bottom several times before finding just the clue or lead he needs to continue pressing on, but outside investigations he's still at odds with Lady Luck.

He's the only student with a poorly-fitting bathroom door that sticks closed, but that same door clears him of suspicion of murder, because he knew how to open it while the murderer did not and had to force their way in. He gets roped into being the unwilling referee for a sauna endurance contest, which ends up giving him a crucial piece of knowledge that lets him solve another murder. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Danganronpa3">Danganronpa 3</a></em>, he slips and falls on his ass like an idiot, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalDodge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoincidentalDodge">narrowly dodging a wrench thrown at his head</a>.

Then he was kidnapped for said inheritance but ended up being saved by the police, and also found a winning lottery ticket in the bag the kidnappers stuffed him in. And so on, and so on.

</li><li> During the First World War, the italians were struggling against the austro-hungarian forces. In 1917 the USA entered into war and engaged to send tons of supplies, particularly food which was the most imperative resources, but convoys suffered delays. "Luckily" for the italians, this meant that when food arrived, it was too late to send it to the military depots of the city of Udine, near the battle front. Meanwhile, the austro-hungarian troops defeated the italians at Caporetto and advanced by kilometers and kilometers, occupying Udine too, but finding its depots almost empty. In 1918 the stockpiled food was one of the decisive factors in the Allied victory against the Central powers, as the italian troops were well fed and organized, while the austrians suffered famine.
