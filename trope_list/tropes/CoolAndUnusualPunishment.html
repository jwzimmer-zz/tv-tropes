</p><p>Besides, why beat the hero when you can torture him with the most horrible thing in the universe... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoudOfWar">six hours of opera</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord">Scare Chord</a>)!

Don't make me create robots that don't do anything <strong>useful</strong>! Pleeeeeease!
</div><ul><li> A later episode has Urd go further by forcing Skuld to look at a whole table full of useless machines just moving around after the latter committed a graver offense. Needless to say, Skuld was wailing at the whole "spectacle".
</li><li> In one episode, Sayoko tries to extract Belldandy's secret from Keiichi by letting snails crawl on his chest and smashing toy cars with a hammer. These are obviously ineffective, but her line of reasoning had some sense: snails tend to be general <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Squick</a> in anime (it's used in other anime too, usually with negative connotations), and she probably figured a car lover like Keiichi would <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterrogationByVandalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterrogationByVandalism">react at the destruction of even their likenesses</a>.

The funniest thing?

<ul><li> Also played straight much later, with Dabura, king of Hell. When he ends up in the afterlife, King Yemma sends him to Heaven instead. He breaks almost instantly, and all following cameos feature him espousing a love of peace, friendship, and flowers.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HeatGuyJ">Heat Guy J</a></em> there is a city-state called Magnagalia. Unlike Judoh, where the main plot takes place, Magnagalia has no capital punishment. Instead, criminals (usually murderers) convicted and sentenced to 100 years or more are genetically and surgically altered such that their head becomes that of an animal, so that when they look in the mirror they see this beast staring back at them.

Clair seems to have worked out a deal with this man that if he can write suitably impressive poetry, he'll let the man go—but the man's poetry is terrible.

They meet up later, and the rich man is chained to a loud, rude, and domineering battle-axe. "I stepped on a duck, and I'm on probation. She's my warden," he explained. Much later, they meet again. As they approach each other, the rich man sees the bum chatting happily at length with a tall, beautiful woman. The rich man exclaims, "Wow! What did you do to deserve <em>this</em>?!" The woman then holds up their shackled wrists and says "I don't know about him, but <em>I</em> stepped on a duck."

Punishments for breaking the school's rules include removing your rights to forks, spoons, glasses and knives at the cafeteria. And if you miss one of the vice-principal's violin concerts, you are required to buy him a bag of candy and sit in his office watching him eat it all.

He might even be <em>satirical</em>.
<ul><li> Elsewhere in the same book, when talking dog Gaspode was reluctant to help Carrot locate Angua, Carrot threatened to "turn the matter over to Corporal Nobbs," a fellow officer with little in the way of moral objections whose own humanity has been repeatedly questioned. Gaspode's bitter reply: "That's what I like—<em>incentive</em>."

And woe betide you if he ever gives anyone a choice. Never let him give you a choice!
<div class="indent"> <strong>Vetinari</strong>: If you don't want to take my offer, you have only to walk through that door and you will never hear from me again. <br/><strong>Moist</strong>: Excuse me, I'd just like to check something. <br/>...There was nothing beyond, and that included a floor.

Under Astfgl's kingship of Hell, a very specific boredom has been perfected—the expensive boredom that goes on during vacations when you <em>should</em> be having fun.
<ul><li> Which turned out to be so tortuous that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the <em>demons</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">basically went "Screw This!"</a> <em>and overthrew him</em>.

Subverted when Vetinari quite reasonably points out to him that while the job offer is certainly unusual, it is not very cruel. On the other hand in the dungeon there are a whole range of punishments which are very unusual and <em>extremely</em> cruel if Moist would like to try them for purposes of comparison...
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RaisingSteam">Raising Steam</a></em>, Lord Vetinari's latest form of physical persuasion is described graphically. It's called The Kitten Torture. Yes, it involves kittens. And yes, it is the cunning, devious, and wholly persuasive, product of a completely unwarped mind. (And there's a reason why it goes on this trope rather than one involving animal cruelty and unbelievable sadism).
<ul><li> For the curious: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The Kitten Torture is presided over by Cedric; not the smartest, but dutiful and very fond of kittens, with which the streets of Ankh-Morpork were overflowing. The victim is locked in an iron maiden, just large enough to sit in, along with a large number of kittens. Every time one of the kittens was distressed and made its distress known, Cedric would open the maiden and give the victim a good cudgeling, in proportion to the distress of the kitten. It's absurd, but it works; visitors are amazed by the atmosphere of happiness, where purring resonated through the dungeon. </span>

</li><li> In Mark Leyner's <em>Et Tu, Babe</em> the protagonist gets high on Abraham Lincoln's morning breath, and is arrested for 'Theft of a Federally Protected Biospecimen'. Some of the sentences for this crime are execution by underwater speargunning, nasal septumectomy, and punitive confiscation. The protagonist makes a plea to get the latter, and while the sentence is carried out, he is restrained in a van and forced to watch the wooden narrative scenes from porn movies.

One of her punishments for a misbehaving child is to force him to eat a (very large) chocolate cake. In front of the whole school.

Then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">Trunchbull smashes the platter over his head.</a> Which, in the book, is described as having no effect on the boy, as he's too stuffed from the cake to feel it. In the film, he just stands there and belches, making the kids laugh and angering Trunchbull even more.
<ul><li> Eating a whole cake would make most people sick, so Trunchbull was probably hoping he'd vomit in front of the entire school so she could make him walk around in vomit-covered clothes all day.
</li><li> This is practically Trunchbull's M.O., since the more out-there her punishments of students are, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CassandraTruth">the less likely parents are going to believe the children trying to tell them</a>.

Like causing Mr. Wormwood to accidentally bleach his hair, then superglue his hat to his head, or spilling a glass of water with a newt in it onto the Trunchbull's dress.

He <em>drives several mind readers insane,</em> and theorizes he may have started a rash of accordion thefts by convincing them of the magical nature of the instrument.

For instance, one Watch member punished is a teenage girl, and her punishment is having to be a normal teenager and be around other teenagers, which she quickly finds annoying.

If a car breaks down and the presenter cannot get it going again, his punishment is to use the backup car for the rest of the journey.
<ul><li> In the Botswana special, the backup was an old-model VW Beetle.
</li><li> In the Vietnam special, it was a motorbike painted in a bright and gaudy American flag livery and blasting Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the USA", with the radio controls disabled.
<ul><li> Ironically if you listen to the lyrics, "Born in the USA" is a protest song about a man who gets sent to Vietnam, loses his best friend, and can't find work after coming back home as a disgruntled veteran. If the Vietnamese understood the song, they might even like it. Unfortunately, most of them don't speak English.
</li></ul></li><li> In a Season 13 episode involving a long drive in France and a race on Val Thorens's ice-driving track, it was a Morris Marina—a car which, inexplicably, usually winds up crushed under a piano whenever it appears on the show. The presenters blame a nearby piano moving service, Careless Airways.
<ul><li> Adding insult to injury, this was a rare instance where the backup car was required (as James's selection died.) Heaping a metric ton of insult to injury, it proved to be the car that won the challenge. (One guess what happened after they walked away from it at the ice-track finish line. They blamed Careless Airways' French affiliate.)
</li></ul></li><li> The one where they went to America, although they had no idea it was going to be punishment. As a joke on the stereotypes of USA Southerners (which aren't true... right?) they paint some joke things on each other's car. Hammond's (painted by May) says "Man-love rules OK", Clarkson's (painted by Hammond) says "Country and western is rubbish", and May's (painted by Clarkson) says "Hillary for President". They laugh at how idiotic they feel, and stop at a petrol station to fill up. The owner is like 'Are you serious?' and they're like 'It's just a joke, we're sorry if you're offended'... and she subsequently calls her friends and they have a mob of people chasing after the 3 guys <em>and the camera crew</em>. The rest we see of that is a mobile phone recording of them absolutely <em>shitting</em> themselves and trying to rub the words off their cars. Completely unexpected but a cool and unusual punishment for thinking that Southerners aren't like their stereotype.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/ClassicalMythology">Classical Mythology</a> was rife with brutal physical torture, but also featured several bizarre and less obviously torturous punishments. A few potent examples include...:
<ul><li> Tantalus, whose punishment for killing his son and serving him as a meal to the gods was to stand in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches. Whenever he reached for the fruit, the branches raised his intended meal from his grasp. Whenever he bent down to get a drink, the water receded before he could get any. Thus was born the word <em><strong>tantalize</strong></em>.
</li><li> Sisyphus was a sly and crafty king who was cursed to roll a huge boulder up a hill, only to watch it roll back down, and to repeat this throughout eternity.
</li><li> Atlas, who Zeus condemned to hold the sky on his shoulders. (This is usually misinterpreted as the Earth.)
</li><li> Medusa was already a little too pretty for Athena's liking, but the last straw was when she had the sheer gall of getting raped inside one of Athena's temples, and by a God at that (Poseidon, if you're curious). Most wise Athena must have been in a blaming-the-victim mood that day because she turned her into, well, <em>the</em> Medusa (or, it could be that she had no authority to punish her uncle). (That was the version given by Ovid in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMetamorphoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMetamorphoses">The Metamorphoses</a></em>. Most earlier versions aren't clear on the "rape" part, a term that has an ambiguous meaning in Greek myths, and in this case would have more to do with <em>Athena's</em> consent, not Medusa's.) Some scholars think that Medusa was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePunishment">deliberately</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CursedWithAwesome">Cursed With Awesome</a> so that she'd <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverBeHurtAgain">Never Be Hurt Again</a>, citing that the Emblem of Medusa was often used to denote a women's shelter.
<ul><li> In another version, Aphrodite turned Medusa into a monster for the crime of being prettier than the Goddess of Love and Beauty.
</li></ul></li><li> Athena is also on record for turning Arachne into a spider. There are various versions of just exactly why:
<ul><li> Arachne was punished for hubris. She proclaimed that she was a better weaver than Athena. When you're dealing with the Greek pantheon, it's really not wise to make those kinds of boasts.
</li><li> In another version, Arachne challenged Athena to a weaving contest, and while Athena admitted that Arachne's weaving was technically flawless, the image that Arachne wove was one of the gods and goddesses acting like idiots and making fools of themselves. So the punishment was for, on top of everything else, not showing proper respect to the gods. Athena was generally one of the more level-headed deities in the myths, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BewareTheNiceOnes">apparently one can push even her too far.</a>
</li><li> Still a third version has Arachne hanging herself after seeing how much better Athena was. Athena saw her bloated, hanging body, and took pity on her, restoring her to life as a spider (arachne in Greek), a creature with a bloated body that hangs from a thread and weaves it to live.
</li></ul></li><li> Echo, a nymph with a bad habit of gossiping, was stripped of her voice by Hera when the goddess realized that Echo was distracting her from searching for her wayward husband, Zeus. Later, after seeing how utterly miserable Echo had become, Hera had a slight change of heart, and returned Echo's voice to her, changing it so that she could only repeat whatever she heard. Things got worse when she fell in love with Narcissus, and Eros tried and failed to make him fall in love with her: Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection, and broke Echo's heart when he proclaimed his love for his own reflection in stereo. Heartbroken, Echo pined away until all that was left of her was her voice, while Narcissus stared at his own reflection until he starved to death, whereupon the first of the eponymous flowers sprang up at the site of his death.
<ul><li> Some versions of the story have his ashes being scattered at the spot where the first such flowers shortly started growing.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the tale of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/WilliamTell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Myth/WilliamTell">William Tell</a>, Albrecht Gessler punishes Tell for not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KneelBeforeZod">bowing to his hat</a> by forcing him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WilliamTelling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WilliamTelling">shoot an apple off his son's head with a crossbow</a>, knowing that if he failed he would have a very high chance of maiming or killing his own son.

These punishments include, but aren't limited to, changing nipple colors, having problems at retail, and never properly being clean. And since the whole drawing is a double-edged sword from the start, the "winner" is also given some sort of reversal of the punishment.

</li><li> Ever been to Arlington National Cemetery? That's one huge example of this trope. Union Quartermaster-General Montgomery C. Meigs was asked to find a new place to bury the Civil War dead. What did he do? He chose the house and property of the man he felt was responsible, Confederate General and Virginian Robert E. Lee. (We should note there was no shortage of bad blood between Meigs and Lee, as each regarded the other as a traitor: Meigs, a Georgian who remained loyal to the Union, saw Lee as a traitor for rebelling against his homeland, the United States, while Lee, a Virginian first and foremost, saw Meigs as a traitor for abandoning his homeland, the State of Georgia.) It gets even better though, when Meigs' son was killed in battle he buried him in Mrs. Lee's flower bed. Oh the delicious irony.
</li><li> The small town of Mason, Texas had a problem with the influx of prisoners to its tiny jail. The sheriff's solution? Deter re-offenders by painting the inside of the jail pink and forcing the prisoners to wear pink jumpsuits and making them eat bologna sandwiches for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (Apparently, <a class="urllink" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/10/national/main2077390.shtml">it worked.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>)

<ul><li> Gallagher used to have a joke like that, saying that drivers should carry toy guns that shoot suction cup darts for when they see another driver being a jerk; and that when a car gets four darts, the other drivers can pull him over and each take a tire.

</li><li> You also have some of the more minor ones that drive people insane. One shown by the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMenWhoStareAtGoats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMenWhoStareAtGoats">The Men Who Stare at Goats</a></em> is a flickering light. Lock someone in a room with it and most people will go insane, especially if it is at a slow random pace, like Chinese water torture. The playing of a kiddy song over and over was just plain cruel. An especially interesting one as well is not allowing someone to go into deep sleep, so even though they slip out of consciousness, when you wake them up to interrupt them they don't feel like they've slept at all. Although after a few days they start hallucinating and go batshit insane but it's better than some of the other ways.
<ul><li> The No Sleep one was used on <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Cersei Lannister</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire">A Song of Ice and Fire</a></em> to make them confess their sins. It worked.
</li></ul></li><li> Two old men in Britain were convicted of making the lives of everyone nearby a misery with their endless feuding. The judge ordered them to be handcuffed together for 12 hours per day. They became fast friends, since the alternative was unthinkable.
</li><li> The above example may have been inspired by <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrew%27s_fiddle">the two-man version of the shrew's fiddle called a "double fiddle"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a torture device used in medieval Germany and Austria. If two people were arguing excessively over something trivial, a judge could order them both put in this device facing each other, forcing them to talk to each other (and likely be laughed at by everyone in the town) until the argument was resolved.
</li><li> Punishments involving music:
<ul><li> Hear a story once, where people were playing loud rap music in a dorm. It was keeping people in the next room awake, so what did they do? If you guessed blasted classical music through the walls back to them, then you're today's winner!
</li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NickelodeonMagazine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/NickelodeonMagazine">Nickelodeon Magazine</a></em> had an article about a judge whose punishment for teens blasting rap music in public places was to put them in a room and force them to listen to Beethoven for several hours. (Maybe he was a fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AClockworkOrange">A Clockwork Orange</a></em>.)
</li><li> In a similar vein, there was a story about two students in a dorm who got into a loudness war with their sound systems. Every night, one would turn up his rock, the other would turn up his rap, until it was impossible to hear anything on the floor. It stopped when one student down the hall, sick of the noise, woke them up at 8AM with a 2-stroke chainsaw revving at full volume outside their doors.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MontyPython">Monty Python</a> song <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbRyH6fkee0">I Like Traffic Lights<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1685m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1685m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1685m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Listen.

</li><li> In 1989, a United States Delta Force team cornered Panama dictator Manuel Noriega in the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See, the diplomatic quarters of Vatican City. Since they couldn't go in and get him, they instead enacted a campaign of psychological warfare known as <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Nifty_Package">Operation Nifty Package<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which including blaring loud rock music until the Papal ambassador convinced Noriega to surrender himself.
</li><li> In the Ottoman-Saudi War, Abdullah bin Saud was forced to hear his victorious enemies play a flute before being beheaded. This is because he belonged to a fundamentalist Islamic sect that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianEdict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DystopianEdict">explicitly forbid listening to music</a>, with such sentence being essentially torture for him.
</li></ul></li><li> Military punishments:
<ul><li> There was a instructor in ROTC, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain">Captain</a>, who would have a cadet stand at attention in the back of the room if he caught him nodding off. If the cadet STILL managed to nod off while at attention, the instructor would have them hold a chair over their head. (This is akin to proper military behavior. If someone is nodding off during a briefing it was perfectly understandable to get up from your seat and stand in the back.)
</li><li> It only ever gets more creative when you get into the real military, where they're allowed to humiliate you on a grand scale in front of dozens if not hundreds of your peers. Picture things on the level of fraternity hazing, only it's not hazing because it's punishment rather than a membership requirement. Take for example, "The Dying Cockroach," in which the soldier being punished was forced to lie on their back while kicking and flailing their arms and yelling "I'm a dying cockroach!" until the punisher saw fit to let it end.
</li><li> Another example: Leave your weapon unattended? Do a series of Iron Mikes to 'buy' it back. Fall asleep in a class session? Stand at the back of the room, holding a canteen, looking through the loop that holds the lid on (playing sniper it's called.) Get caught watching the TV in the mess-hall? You get put on your elbows and toes to 'watch TV', and occasionally change channels. Caught doing something in the chow line you aren't supposed to? Stand outside the line reciting EXACTLY what you did so that other recruits don't repeat the mistake. It's safe to say that since the days of a Drill Sergeant beating the snot out of you ended, it just encouraged them to get creative in the HOW they punish you and your whole unit.
</li><li> There is also MASH, which stands for Make A Sailor Hurt. They're not allowed to beat you, but they are allowed to make you exercise until you wish they were beating you. (Called "Beasting" in the British Army, and every bit as horrible as the word implies.)
</li><li> An Air Force drill sergeant was once <em>extremely</em> pissed because his men failed an inspection. After spending a half hour loudly dressing them down, he announced that all that yelling had made him thirsty, and he wanted a refreshing beverage from the soda machine on the first floor. No, he was tired and didn't want to walk all the way down there. No, he didn't want someone to go get him a soda because he didn't know what he wanted and needed to look at all the choices. His solution? Ordering his men to <em>go get the soda machine and bring it to him.</em> An eight hundred pound soda machine. Up three flights of stairs. Once they did so, he bought his beverage, popped the tab, took a long drink, then ordered his men to put the soda machine back where they'd found it, and reminded them that there'd be another inspection tomorrow.
</li><li> The royal Military Academy at Sandhurst has a punishment called "Show-clean". this involves cleaning and polishing every issue item in your locker, arranging every item within the locker on the correct shelf or hook as per regulation, and then taking the whole thing to the guardhouse on a hand-truck for inspection. If a single item is out of place or showing even a speck of dirt, everything gets tipped out on the ground regardless of weather, and the hapless cadet officer is instructed to truck it all back to his quarters and do it all over again. And again. And again. Until the duty NCO is satisfied. As NCO instructors at Sandhurst are largely drawn from the Brigade of Guards, who have VERY high standards of presentation, this process may take some time.
</li><li> Russian cadets are forced, if they're caught doing something forbidden or violate army rules, to carry around big wooden objects reminding of their misdeed. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.boredpanda.com/russian-army-punishments-hazing-dedovshchina/">Here's a few examples.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> In Britain, a deathwish driver from Lincolnshire was forced to see the consequences of his driving by going to the accident and emergency department at the local hospital. Needless to say, this was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> in itself on how <em>not</em> to drive.

</li><li> Famous case from the 1980s: a notorious slumlord was sentenced to live in one of his own buildings. Yup, Joe Pesci's <em>The Super</em> was based on a true story.
</li><li> A Malaysian political aide tweeted defamatory comments about his friend's employer. They responded by suing him, and he was forced to <a class="urllink" href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/02/defamation-settlement-requires-malaysian-man-to-apologize-100-ti/">apologize 100 times on Twitter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

They denied the request, and sent him back to house arrest, thinking that arguing with the wife was more than enough punishment.
</li><li> A small example, but as punishment for stealing soap in the Mohave county the thief is forced to wash themselves with said soap until it is completely used up.
</li><li> The German author Hans Fallada remembers in his biographical work <em>Damals bei uns daheim</em> how he and his brother sneaked into the storage room and ate part of a Baumkuchen intended for a family celebration. The punishment: for quite a long while, they got (pieces of) the rest of the cake as school meals, until they couldn't stand the confectionary any more.
</li><li> The procedures for <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_conclave">electing<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThePope">pope</a> essentially come down to locking the cardinals into a room until they make a decision, and if that doesn't work, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeniedFoodAsPunishment">start restricting their food supply</a>. Historically, this has included such things as removing the roof.
</li><li> A few instances of men having sex with goats in rural areas have been punished by forcing the suitor to pay a bride-price to the owner and formally get married to the subject of their affections.
</li><li> A documentary said that detainees in Guantanamo Bay were tortured by forcing them to listen to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/sesame-street-songs-allegedly-used-guantanamo-bay-interrogations-014514261.html">songs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
<ul><li> Listening to <em>anything</em> at the duration and volumes reported would cause sleep deprivation and other problems, though; the Sesame Street songs may have been good choices (they were certainly good choices if making people take the technique less seriously was the intention) but even a song you want to listen to isn't one you want forcibly played to you all night at unreasonable decibel levels.

</li><li> One kid in the Netherlands thought it would be funny to hack his older brother's Facebook profile. The brother did think about doing the same to him in retaliation, but decided to take a somewhat more creative tack. He <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-DTQPBUJJ4&amp;feature=colike">turned his brother's room into a little girl's room<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MyLittlePony">My Little Pony</a> light switch, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JustinBieber">Justin Bieber</a> posters, a set of girl's rollerblades, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> novels and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick">vibrator</a>.

</li><li> According to the AA, Thames Valley police have allowed primary schools to borrow their radar guns for use in classes. Children are allowed to stand at the school gate and point the gun at passing cars to measure their speed. Drivers caught speeding in this manner have been given two choices, either face prosecution as normal, since the gun records enough evidence, or attend the primary school to explain to a group of preteens why they were speeding. Most prefer to be prosecuted, even though it costs an average of £600 (US$1,000) in fines and insurance premiums.
<ul><li> Because of the effectiveness, more and more regions are setting up <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/headlines/38021839">similar schemes.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

</li><li> The Ancient Greeks were in on this as well. During the Olympic Games, everyone hates cheaters, okay? The Ancient Greeks had only one punishment for cheaters. They were given a statue of their own in a specific hall that everyone went to and they all had to carve on the accompanying tablet what they had done to deserve it: "My name is XX and I cheated by..." In other words, cheaters were immortalized for everyone to come see and point and laugh at for the rest of eternity. Some people just had style, you know?
</li><li> Most companies who run MMORPGs have a simple solution to deal with players who cheat or exploit glitches, like botting, hacking, sharking, illegal downloading, exploiting glitches, or spamming - banning their accounts. However, some have thought up unique ways to punish cheaters:
<ul><li> As of August 2015, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverquestII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EverquestII">Everquest II</a></em> unveiled a unique solution: the "prison server" of Drundar. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/cheaters-to-get-locked-away-on-prison-server-in-ev/1100-6429927/">as explained here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, characters transferred to Drundar are isolated from characters belonging to rule-abiding players, and customer support is inaccessible there; players can use those characters to cheat all they want, because they're only cheating against other cheaters. (This doesn't ban the account, however; Daybreak Games maintains that, for now, this is an experiment.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Titanfall">Titanfall</a></em> has taken inspiration from Daybreak Games by creating a prison server of their own. Cheaters banished there can still use whatever hacked or sharked downloads they used, as their only opponents are other cheaters.
</li><li> <em>Marvel vs Capcom 3</em> also does something similar. In this game, if you disconnect before your fight is over, then you can avoid having a loss on your record. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DevelopersForesight">the devs thought of that too</a>, and if your in-fight disconnect numbers got suspicious, you were sent to a special server that was entirely populated with people who did the same thing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IronicHell">If you try to weasel out of a loss, then they send you to a place where everyone else weasels you out of your wins.</a>
</li><li> One famous example in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2">Guild Wars 2</a></em> happened when a player was not just cheating, he was <em>blatantly</em> cheating. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCSYfJZNYLY">(As in, respawing all over the place where most players couldnt and attacking with weapons he clearly wouldnt have access too.)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> The devs shanghaied control of his character, unequipped all of his gear, then made the character climb to the top of the highest point of the games <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HubLevel">Hub Level</a> and had him leap off in a very public suicide. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfUi9DzBuo">(And they taped it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem">the whole game community to see.)</a> <em>Then</em> they perma-banned the player and deleted his characters.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> online:
<ul><li> One time, some wise guys found a glitch that let them import overpowered cars into the game. When Rockstar Games found out, they put in a program that made these ill-gotten cars self-destruct when the player got in automatically killing him. For one day, the game world was lit up like the Fourth of July.
</li><li> <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> also has a "prison server" like the ones mentioned above for bad sports. What makes them notable is that they also put everyone in said server in a dunce cap.
</li></ul></li><li> When <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GearsOfWar2">Gears of War 2</a></em> started, some players found a way to unlock every Achievement at once. Didnt last long. When the devs found out, every player who exploited the glitch found they had lost those achievements and had gained a new one  worth no Gs at all  called Cheater For Life.
</li><li> Similarly, in both versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakensang" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Drakensang">Drakensang</a></em> there were several Gotchas for people using a cracked version. In the first one, one city guard would not show up at her appointed place, trying to rescue a group member from jail landed the whole group in there (without a way out), and later in the game the characters would slow down more and more if a crack was detected. In the second one, instead of the group's healer being able to heal a group member who had been disabled in a fight, for someone using a crack, only a paid healer would be able to heal those characters. Unfortunately, occasionally, people who needed to use a virtual machine professionally were also detected as running a crack...
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/H1Z1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/H1Z1">H1Z1</a></em> had something novel. After issuing over 24,000 bans to players who were exploiting purchased hacks and cheats, Daybreak's CEO made a statement saying banned plays would be unbanned if they apologized publically via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube">YouTube</a> and emailed him a link of it. While that seems like getting off easy (especially seeing as Daybreak had lost 500K in revenue) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantHumiliationJustAddYouTube" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantHumiliationJustAddYouTube">one could say that going on YouTube and admitting you were a thief is punishment enough</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a></em>, a glitch lets a player make a <em>lot</em> of in-game currency by selling hides and pearls. An update didn't remove the glitch, but it did ensure that anyone who exploited it would eventually encounter a special NPC, a rather unfriendly tax man demanding it be paid back. That's right, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntimidatingRevenueService">force cheaters to deal with the IRS.</a></em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout76" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout76">Fallout 76</a></em>, cheaters were banned from their account, and would only be given their account back if they wrote a 500 word essay on "Why the use of third-party cheat software is detrimental to an online game community".
</li></ul></li><li> Also, some video game companies thought up creative ways to punish players who pirated copies of their hottest games (this is sometimes preferable to simply making the game not work if its copy protection is broken, as making it harder to tell when the game's been successfully cracked means it takes longer the break the copy protection<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note37lfq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note37lfq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note37lfq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">The idea is to slow them down, as most AAA titles make the majority of their sales in the first few months of release</span>):
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Crysis">Crysis</a></em>, if you try to play a pirated copy, your gun shoots <em>chickens</em> that do no damage at all, and also slow the game down, making the game unwinnable unless you can somehow use your fists through the entire game.
</li><li> The developers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamAsylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a></em> realized the game would be a prime target, so they fixed it so that pirated copies had a serious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerf</a> on Batman's gliding ability, making it impossible to reach some key areas and frustrating the owners to no end. This caught at least one player who had posted a thread on the developers' official message board asking how to get past this exact problem, outing themselves as using a pirated copy; the developers simply replied that "it's not a bug in the game's code, it's a bug in your moral code."
</li><li> Pirated copies of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SeriousSam">Serious Sam 3</a></em> included a extra enemy that was literally invincible, an undead red scorpion man. Players on the forums pleading for tips on how to beat this thing (proving they had a pirated copy) sure made fools of themselves.
</li><li> Know those scenes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims4">The Sims 4</a></em> where your toon goes to the shower or toilet and his/her nudity is blurred out? Do it in an illegal version, and the blur never goes away. Ever.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MirrorsEdge">Mirror's Edge</a></em> may be all about fighting "the system", but the developers did <em>not</em> want players to do it. Anyone with a pirated copy would never make the first jump; trying would make Faith hesitate from fear, and if the player persisted, fall to her death.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a></em> gives the owner of the pirated copy fair warning first; a fairy tells Spyro that the game may be pirated, and warns him not to proceed. If the player does anyway, if he reaches the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>, the game shuts down right before the battle, deleting the save file.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BanjoKazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a></em> had something similar. If you have an illegal copy, Grunty (who tends to troll the player a lot as it is) will eventually pop up and cackle, "Now I will erase your game pack, because you had the need to hack!" And this is a <em>warning</em>, because she doesn't do it until you actually try save the game. (Cruel, maybe, but she <em>is</em> evil.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameDevTycoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GameDevTycoon">Game Dev Tycoon</a></em> has one of the best ways to punish pirates, bar none. This game is all about designing and marketing video games. Play an illegal version of the game, and you'll go bankrupt when the game <em>you</em> design is pirated too much!
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> has a feature that, if you use a pirated copy, upon opening it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Golden Freddy pops up out of nowhere to startle you.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a>: The Experience</em> on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a> assaults the player with vuvuzelas, drowning out the music. And to make matters worse, all the game controls become invisible, forcing the player to frantically search for the exit button to escape the incessant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SensoryAbuse">Sensory Abuse</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a>: Red Alert 2</em> will let you start the game and play as normal...for about 3 minutes, after that everything explodes. <em>Command and Conquer: Generals</em> will do the same thing, but after only 30 seconds.
</li><li> Perhaps the cruelest punishment though came from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EarthBound">EarthBound</a></em>; if your SNES detects you're playing a pirated copy, the amount of enemies dramatically increases, making the game much more difficult to get through. Let's say though you power through it and get to the final boss; if you get to that point, the game locks up and forces you to reset the system. When you boot it back up, <em>your entire save file will have been erased</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> Have a teacher that also happens to be a sports coach, especially a particularly rough sport like American Football? Expect punishments to involve push-ups. Bonus points if the teacher tells the class to count and they decide to be uncooperative. ("1, 3, 2, 8, 5...")
</li><li> In December 2018, a poacher by the name of David Berry Jr. was sentenced to watch the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi">Bambi</a></em> at least once a month for poaching deer over the course of nine years.
