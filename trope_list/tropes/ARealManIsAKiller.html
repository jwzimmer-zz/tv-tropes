</p><p>This tradition of killing as an initiation into manhood is at least as old as ancient Sparta, making this trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanFeudalism">Older Than Feudalism</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">based in reality, not literature</a>. This is about as old as the institution of the hunter-gatherer social order, and about as relevant to a society as that institution as a means of testing the mettle of a new member of the hunting troupe. Still, that doesn't stop many a buttoned-down work-a-day father from suburbia from believing that his son will go astray and won't be of any use to anyone if he doesn't go through this rite of passage which his ancestors may or may not have had to undergo themselves (at least in TV land).

</p><p>A variation of this trope is for elite military forces to kill a man (an enemy or even a low ranking ally) as part of initiation. Outside of the distant past, the twilight years of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japanese Army</a>, or a handful of the small and isolated tribes over half a century ago, it is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscreditedTrope">Discredited Trope</a> (except perhaps in cases where said troop is depicted as being villainous, thereby avoiding <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> considerations). A variation of this which has appeared in a number of productions involves spies who, in order to become full-fledged agents, are required to undergo "a final test" to prove their value, which generally involves cold-bloodedly killing a target, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrenderBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurrenderBackfire">possibly even one trying to surrender</a>. Examples include <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JamesBond">James Bond</a> (who per <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CasinoRoyale2006">Casino Royale (2006)</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JamesBond">original novels</a> needed to assassinate two people before attaining 00 status) and the 2010s version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nikita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nikita">Nikita</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck">Chuck</a></em>, both of which included plotlines in which lead characters were required to kill in order to advance.

In fact, these days, you are <em>much</em> more likely to see this trope inverted: someone is expected to kill to prove something, and it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">their</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">refusal</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">to do so</a> that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeYourself">shows us their character</a> (and in some cases, provides them with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroclesLion">Androcles' Lion</a> protector). It's only in places where there are legitimate targets for murder that we see anything like the original spin. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotEvenHuman">Zombies or aliens</a> or anything, no worries, people will be expected to prove they are worth having along by mercilessly killing them. Other people, even bad people, not so much, though it still happens. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">It's a modern-day thing</a>. There is however certainly a tendency, no doubt originating from this trope, in the more grittier works to expect the men, even those like doctors or pacifists, to join in on the aforementioned justified killing and if they do it's often treated as a moment of them outgrowing their cowardice, while such standards are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MenAreTheExpendableGender">not applied to the physically capable women</a> of the group.

Modern psychology and research implies that sane and psychologically normal men have <em>very</em> strong aversion to killing another human being. The studies of General S.L.A. Marshall showed that only 15% of frontline soldiers ever fired their rifles in combat, and only 2% aimed to kill. Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman has done research on killing in action, and he states that a sane and psychologically normal man must especially be conditioned for him to be able to shoot at the enemy and most of the killing in action is done by indirect fire, machine guns and exceptional individuals (psychopaths and "natural soldiers"). Unfortunately, this conditioning is also the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseHandsHaveKilled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheseHandsHaveKilled">These Hands Have Killed</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a>, especially amongst <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a> veterans, who have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder in frequency far exceeding that of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> veterans.
</p><p>(The concept of "blooded" versus "green" forces (a continuum, not either/or) is different: killing (or dying) is not required, but you must have remained and functioned with your unit for some time in combat before you start to be regarded as trustworthy.)

However, the <em>reason</em> Kenshin avoids killing is because he was the cause of so many deaths in the past.
<ul><li> There's another twisted line of thought preventing him from killing, as he's convinced that taking a single life will turn him into a bloodthirsty killer, and this attitude never changes, even after his master tells him that Shishio wouldn't even be around if Kenshin wasn't so afraid of the "manslayer", who's merely a figment of his imagination. Despite this, fate seems to conspire to keep Kenshin from killing anyone.

The farmer's housecarls quote this trope at him and tries to get him to cut down a pair of his father's slaves. The trope is deconstructed because it's readily apparent that the situation isn't particularly 'manly' (the slaves are restrained) and the boy is a bit of an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmoTeen">Emo Teen</a> either way. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When he eventually <em>does</em> end up killing someone, it's by accident in a fixed duel he was intended to win so the king could accuse his father.

The first episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LaFemmeNikita">The 1990s Series</a> has the same scenario, although it is subverted in that case as Nikita uses her ingenuity to avoid killing anyone (her first on-screen kill occurs a few episodes later with no fanfare, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the end of the series, she'd grown comfortable with killing to the point of being shown delivering "safety shots" into the bodies of disarmed enemies, a case of a character becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkerAndEdgier">Darker and Edgier</a> as a series progresses</span>).

(The title refers to the party that used to be thrown the night before an execution.) However, Sonny loses his nerve and vomits during the walk. Hank is humiliated and furious and confronts him the next morning; the fight ends with Sonny committing suicide. The remainder of the film has Hank struggling with this loss (and notably, his own father chalks Sonny's fate up to weakness).

He considers himself his father's worthy heir because, of the three siblings, he's the only one who kills people on a regular basis ...but the trope gets played on its head: Luigi is by far and large the most childish member of the cast, even more so than an actual teenager.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NakedWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NakedWeapon">Naked Weapon</a></em> features a wide variety of pubescent girls being kidnapped from around the world and sent to a tropical island. After immediately killing anybody who says 'Yes, I wanna go home!', they spend the next 9-10 years in a nonstop boot camp teaching the girls everything there is to know about firearms, human anatomy, unarmed combat, and social interaction, honing them into the world's finest assassins. As a penultimate final exam, they are assembled in their barracks and told that they have two minutes to kill half their number or they will all die.

However, their "performance" is so great that the Madam allows three to survive instead.
<ul><li> Which, if one gives it about a half-second of thought, really is a <em>monstrously</em> wasteful and inefficient way of training assassins, but alas, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">Rule of Cool</a> strikes again...

This is less about making him a man, and more about making him a weapon: his attempts to determine <em>why</em> he's supposed to kill this man are constantly rebuked with the admonishment "you don't need to know". Treadstone is training assassins: the assassins don't need to know <em>why</em> they're killing someone, they just need to <em>do</em> it.

<ul><li> It makes more sense in context. Said sniper had killed three soldiers, and even tortured two of them with non-lethal shots to lure the others into her range.

Sheriff Hoyt, the closest thing Thomas has to a father figure, stares after him with an expression bordering on paternal love and simply states "There comes a time when every boy becomes a man."

Of course, this could be not so much because he doesn't want to kill as it is that his passivity is putting his comrades in more danger than they otherwise would be.
</li><li> Taken to its logical extreme in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em>: The dawn of man begins when apes figure out how to use bones as weapons and kill creatures.

Anderson wants to be a Judge, but she clearly lacks the level of ruthlessness and emotional detachment necessary for the job. During the raid on the apartment, Dredd methodically eliminates every hostile while Anderson can't even fire a shot. She's more willing later on, but the true turning point is when Dredd orders her to execute a perp. After this, she's more sure of herself and Dredd's respect for her grows accordingly. By the end of the film, she's gunning down mooks almost as effectively as Dredd.

The Heathens have a sort of gender-caste system, where gender is not determined by actual sex, but by conduct and career. The ritual to "become a man" involves the Heathens going out and killing a "Savage".

<h3><strong>In General:</strong></h3>
<ul><li> In a number of TV series dealing with cops, and particularly rookie cops, an officer's first kill is sometimes implied to be a rite of passage, and an almost inevitable one. For example, Andy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RookieBlue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RookieBlue">Rookie Blue</a></em> begins as a green cadet learning her craft, but it is not surprising that before the first season was half over her lessons included her first kill. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em> similarly touches on this in two episodes in which a member of the team kills for the first time (simultaneously debunking an aspect of the trope that suggests members of such things as SWAT teams are already all experienced killers).
<ul><li> A related aspect of this is the fact that in many TV series dealing with FBI agents, CIA or other government agents, and cops, if the lead character(s) is <em>not</em> a rookie, then quite often it is implied, if not outright assumed, that they have already killed multiple people in the line of duty and thus are able to shrug off taking lives without an apparent second thought (a dramatic necessity if the writer doesn't intend for a storyline to be sidetracked; one reason why cops are able to stack up multiple body counts yet are rarely shown as being "desked" pending internal investigations in the midst of a storyline). In reality, the vast majority of law enforcement - and spies - go through their entire careers without having to fire a weapon at another human being. Note: this paragraph can apply to virtually every category, but is placed here because, historically, ongoing TV series are more likely to repeatedly place protagonists in deadly force scenarios, whereas films and novels often chronicle single "missions" or incidents.

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Alias">Alias</a></em>: During the third season, details are learned about Sydney Bristow's "lost two years" during which she went deep undercover as an assassin named Julia Thorne. Sydney later arranged to have her memories of the mission suppressed, in part due to some of her actions which included killing an unarmed prisoner in order to prove her loyalty to her "new" employers (Sydney's first kill as an agent is never depicted or mentioned on screen, but is depicted in one of the spin-off prequel novels and is basically shrugged off by the character.

<ul><li> <em>Liberty's Crusade</em> has Kerrigan explain this in detail: a soldier pointed a gun at the head of one of her fellow trainees and she had to kill the soldier before he could pull the trigger.

She does it with no small satisfaction. After this mission, she is mind-wiped, like all Ghosts. Subverted in that she has killed before (well, she mind-controlled a guy to shoot his boss, but that still counts).

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em>, the passage into manhood for the Wolfe family was to bring an elk home for dinner. Heffer, naturally, misunderstands things and ends up bringing home an elk girl he met at a club and fell in love with.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> when Homer is worried that Bart might be gay, he takes him out to kill a deer because that will make a "real" man of him. Of course, it's an unmitigated disaster and Homer, Bart, and Barney end up being rescued by the rest of the family's new gay friend without having to kill anything. On the way to the hunting trip, the men ask Bart whether he's looking forward to it and Bart matter-of-factly comments that he's always considered the idea of a bunch of guys all alone in the woods "kinda gay." Cue awkward expressions and Homer defensively chiding Bart for his 'immature' attitude.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Volcano", Stan's Uncle Jimbo takes the boys hunting and is shocked when Stan doesn't want to kill the rabbit he has a chance to shoot. Jimbo is both surprised and disappointed in Stan, and Eric mercilessly teases him for it. Kenny, on the other hand, has no problems either shooting a whole magazine worth of ammo into a deer or drinking the gasoline for the fishing boat, which impresses Jimbo enough to label him a "dirty little bastard". At the end, Stan finally scores a kill — namely that of the friendly Bigfoot-like Scuzzlebutt, who was just being celebrated for saving their lives — and doesn't understand why Jimbo and the others are upset instead of proud. Trying to figure this out leads the kids to eschew hunting and go watch cartoons instead.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania">Taz-Mania</a></em>, Francis X. Bushlad wants to win his manhood (and the right to wear trousers) by killing a Tasmanian devil. Subverted in that Francis doesn't <em>have</em> to do this, as there are other and more peaceful ways to attain manhood in his tribe. Specifically, his other choices were performing a hostile takeover of a Fortune 500 company or accumulating a stock portfolio with a return of no less than 36% a year. However, Francis insists on forging his spirit in the tradition of his ancestors, and as such has vowed to hunt Taz.

<ul><li> This is pretty much the <em>raison d'etre</em> behind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Conscription">conscription</a>. (Besides raising humongous numbers of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a>, of course).
</li><li> Prior to the ban on lion-hunting, a Massai boy was to spear a lion as part of his rite-of-passage shortly before his circumcision. Some still do, not that it is actively encouraged anymore.
<ul><li> Though it is referenced in a Star Trek TOS novel in which Uhura spears a robotic lion in a simulated safari as a rite of passage.
</li></ul></li><li> Some tribes have to kill a deer or antelope to complete the passage into manhood.
</li><li> American President <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LyndonJohnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> would require anyone seeking his political favor to join him on his Texas ranch where they would go "hunting" (actually, just sit in a blind while someone drove animals to them). If you wanted him to respect you as a man, you had to kill one.
<ul><li> In recent elections, pretty much every contender for the US presidency has had to have at least one picture of themselves in a blaze orange vest carrying a rifle or shotgun. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a>, notably, is one of the few that hasn't pretended to be a hunter. On the other hand, Teddy Roosevelt (to name just one) was an example of a President who actually was a hunter with no pretence involved, and who moreover numbered dangerous animals like lions among his game.
<ul><li> Perhaps Dick Cheney's hunting accident has changed how Joe Public views politicians with guns.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In urban legend, any number of elite special forces teams (Green Berets, SAS, the Nazi SS, etc.) required as a final test of loyalty that the candidate kill a spouse, family member, or other significant personal relation. In a widely-circulated joke based on this tale, 3 agents are candidates, one has a fiancé, one is a newlywed, and one has been married for ten years. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">The first two candidates chicken out and can't pull the trigger</a>, while the third says "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter">The gun had blanks</a>, so I had to beat her to death." (Or strangle, in some versions.)
<ul><li> There's an inversion in one variant: it concerns either the CIA or FBI, and Candidate #3 is a woman who has to kill her husband. Yes, the gun has blanks; yes, she beats him to death.
</li><li> The more recent version of this is with American troops stationed in Iraq or Afghanistan. The story will be some version of an Iraqi or Afghan friendly nervously asking an American, usually a Marine, if they killed their wife, child, pet, or someone important. The response to the inevitable 'no' is 'but then how did you become a Marine?' Unlike the above, there's probably some truth to this one, but it's become enough of an urban myth that any specific instance one hears about probably didn't happen.
</li></ul></li><li> Japanese military training during WWII and the "China incident" took this to an extreme. Not only was the training extremely brutal, a Japanese soldier was not considered fully trained until he killed a prisoner of war with a sword or bayonet, often while the POWs were immobilized. Unfortunately, these deaths were not always as quick or clean as they should have been. There is many a story of a poor young conscript taking several minutes to finally stab his POW somewhere fatal.
</li><li> In Ancient Greece, Spartan boys were sent out naked with only a single blanket to fend for themselves for a period of time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">"living like a werewolf"</a>. Stealing and murdering Helots were the main (and traditional) ways to get food and protection against the elements, but any boy actually found killing a Helot was whipped (for being careless enough to get caught). Since the Helots outnumbered the Spartans by more than ten to one, the Spartans regularly killed off a large chunk of the Helot population to keep them in line. Killing wasn't required, only recommended, for the passage into manhood.
<ul><li> In a zig-zag the battle tactic considered most manly by all ancient Greeks, including Spartans, was to simply get into a big mass and walk forward into another similar mass in the assumption that the toughest mass would steamroll the others. In such circumstances, no one knew how many (if any) people they personally killed, or even cared much, but you <em>jolly well better</em> stay in the place your officer put you throughout the whole thing.
</li></ul></li><li> A British advert in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> advised men (and boys) that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DareToBeBadass">they were not worthy of being a man unless they joined the army</a> (to probably die in a trench in mud and illness).
<ul><li> Just about all mass conscription campaigns feature this trope. For example, during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheAmericanCivilWar">The American Civil War</a>, both sides tacitly supported campaigns of social humiliation for those who didn't volunteer. A notorious tactic in the Southern states was to leave petticoats on their doorsteps.
</li></ul></li><li> Depressingly, this is true in regions that have known mostly war for at least a generation or two, especially in places such as Somalia and Afghanistan, where for many people, war and killing has become <em>the</em> way of life. When children are raised to be fighters in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">a war that doesn't end</a>, killing is the only skill they bring into adulthood, and it's their most important and readily useful (and often <em>only</em>) skill, along with the only one they can pass on. These kinds of wars are especially difficult to bring to a close because killing has become a <em>livelihood</em> by which men have come to define their adult lives, and peacetime means being unemployed, except if they jump to other conflicts as mercenaries or volunteers since there is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">no single second on Earth without any armed conflict somewhere</a>. The Taliban and Al-Shabab are infamous examples of this, as their fighting force are mostly young men who have known only war for most or all their lives.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a> was known to tell the story of how his Uncle Dan came up to him and clapped him on the back after he returned from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, proclaiming "You're a <em>man</em> now!" The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfortunateImplications">implication</a> being that the only way for a boy to become a man was to kill people. Although Vonnegut had never had occasion to kill anybody during his military service, he had seen a <em>lot</em> of death and lived through the firebombing of Dresden, which was cited as one of the more horrific scenes from the European Theater. Imagine that you've just gone through the worst, most traumatic experience of your life, and before you've finished dealing with that trauma, somebody comes up to you and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">congratulates you on it</a></em>. Yeah, Kurt hated the guy.
</li><li> Aversion: While most cultures admire warriors, it is not nearly so common for executioners to be admired. So perhaps "real men kill people and things that are trying to make it difficult for them to be killed."
<ul><li> Special note goes to pre-Revolutionary France, where there were ten or so families that provided the executioners and who all interbred. Why? Because no-one else would associate with them.
</li></ul></li><li> Apparently, one reason the Zulu people were so feared in battle was that they had entire regiments of young soldiers who were not allowed to have sex <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">until they'd killed a man</a>. Some have interpreted that as not being allowed to be <em>married</em> and that fooling around was permitted.
</li><li> The mining fields of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWildWest">The Wild West</a>, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MarkTwain">Mark Twain</a> describes in the autobiographical book 'Roughing It': "... (I)n a new mining district the rough element predominates, and a person is not respected until he has "killed his man." That was the very expression used. If an unknown individual arrived, they did not inquire if he was capable, honest, industrious, but—had he killed his man? If he had not, he gravitated to his natural and proper position, that of a man of small consequence; if he had, the cordiality of his reception was graduated according to the number of his dead. It was tedious work struggling up to a position of influence with bloodless hands; but when a man came with the blood of half a dozen men on his soul, his worth was recognized at once and his acquaintance sought."
</li><li> Although media coverage, and movies and TV shows, might suggest otherwise, a first kill is not considered a necessary rite of passage for most police officers. Indeed, the vast majority of cops will go through their careers never once having to fire their weapon at a person.
<ul><li> As a matter of fact, a police officer would do well to avoid killing a suspect. It not only prompts an investigation, but can lead to suspension of duty and even dismissal from the job if it's ruled unjustifiable. To say nothing of possible wrongful death lawsuits or psychological trauma. (And, particularly in some parts of the US, one's name being the centre of massive controversy. Indeed, there are <em>many</em> motivating factors in why police officers try to only pull the trigger as a very last resort, such as facing an immediate kill-or-be-killed/kill-or-an-innocent-will-be-killed scenario.
</li></ul></li><li> Criminal organizations do not exactly withhold "adult" status to those who haven't killed, but many have their own initiations or special prerogatives for those who have killed.
</li><li> Along the same lines, there exists a social hierarchy in prisons. People who commit non-violent crimes (burglary, drug offences, white collar crime, etc.) tend to be fairly low-ranking, whereas people who commit violent crimes (assault, gang violence, murder etc.) tend to be a bit more higher ranking. The most respected prisoners tend to be people who have committed violent crimes against authority or government figures, like, say, cop-killers or terrorists (though a lot of criminals aren't crazy about the latter either). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">Zig-zagged</a> in that those who killed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">children</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHitAGirl">women</a> (especially their wives or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matricide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Matricide">mothers</a>) are regarded as the absolute lowest of the low, and much like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil">sexual predators</a>, they often have to be placed in isolated cells to avoid being killed by other prisoners. (See, for example, what happened to the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller">Serial Killer</a> Jeffrey Dahmer.) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">Hey, you have to draw the line somewhere, you know</a>.
