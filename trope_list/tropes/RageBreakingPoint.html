</p><p>Sometimes characters have every reason to be angry, but they try to hold it back for various reasons. Sometimes, the reasons are selfish; sometimes, they are because they know it would be wrong to get angry or that blowing their top would have bad consequences (such as losing their job, getting arrested, or even getting themselves or others killed); and sometimes, the reason is just for the sake of appearances.
</p><p>Eventually, there will be a last straw. It could range from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RantInducingSlight">a minor thing</a> to out-and-out hitting the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a>.

Some stories might even have this trigger a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Heroic Second Wind</a>. Also, if the character's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> is hit, this character might even be <em>twice</em> as berserk as usual.

After what seems like a month or so, his beloved mentor Jiraiya is killed, his village is destroyed while he is away, and his teacher Kakashi has died from overuse of chakra. All have been caused by one guy, Pain. Naruto goes to defeat Pain with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">his new power</a>, but is quickly brought down. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingEmotionalCrutch">Hinata</a> tries to attack Pain after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnguishedDeclarationOfLove">she sincerely confesses her love to Naruto</a>, but after a brief fight, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpaledWithExtremePrejudice">Pain stabs her</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Believing her to be killed</a>, Naruto, now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">filled with rage</a>, gives himself to the very power that harmed his comrades before...but it also, for the first time, <em>scared</em> Pain because he suddenly found that even his vaunted power was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">as nothing</a> against the terrifying power of the Nine-Tails. By the time Naruto finally came back out of it, Pain was not as confident as before.

<ul><li> After witnessing the way Mayuri treated his own men and offered to keep Orihime as an experimental lab-rat, Uryuu was already pissed off. Once Mayuri started mocking Uryuu's Quincy heritage and revealed he'd spent years experimenting on Quincies, he really got on Uryuu's bad side. However, when he revealed the last Quincy he had experimented on and tortured to death was Uryuu's own mentor and grandfather, Souken, Uryuu finally snapped... transforming right into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneWingedAngel">One-Winged Angel</a> form that not only turned him into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingWasteland">Walking Wasteland</a> but also one-shotted both Mayuri and his bankai in the process.
</li><li> The Vandenreich's first invasion of Seireitei decimates the First Division, putting Yamamoto into a state of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TranquilFury">Tranquil Fury</a> that only becomes more obvious once he realizes not even Mayuri can locate the secret Quincy base. When the second invasion occurs, this time bringing with it Yamamoto's ancient nemesis and the Vandenreich leader, Yamamoto's response is the story's most epic example of someone exploding with rage. His loss of temper results in an eruption of both violence and power that shakes the <em>entire city</em>, triggering an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Heroic Second Wind</a> in the beleaguered Captains in the process.

<ul><li> One of the earliest ones of note, of course, is when Vegeta realizes Gohan stole the first Dragon Ball he found on Namek. He got the first Dragon Ball after slaughtering a Namekian village. While he was stealing the other six from Freeza, Gohan found and took the first one. They have an encounter where Gohan is able to bluff his way into convincing Vegeta he doesn't have it. When Vegeta goes to retrieve that Dragon Ball, and can't find it, he puts 2 and 2 together and flies off in a rage.
<div class="indent"><strong>Vegeta:</strong> You Earthling punks! Play me for fool, will you!? You'll pay for this!
</div></li><li> Super Saiyan transformations are often triggered through such an event. Frieza mortally wounds Piccolo, killed Krillin on Namek and then threatened to do the same to Gohan, finally infuriating Goku enough to trigger his first transformation. Vegeta transforms, ironically, upon giving up becoming a Super Saiyan and his subsequent despairing rage with himself over doing so.

<ul><li> In "Can You Spare a Dime?", after Mr. Krabs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InspectorJavert">accuses Squidward of stealing his first dime</a>, Squidward resigns from his job and ends up homeless as a result. SpongeBob finds him and takes him into his home until he can find a new job, and while initially grateful, Squidward soon <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAdvantageOfGenerosity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingAdvantageOfGenerosity">takes advantage of the situation</a>, refusing to get out of bed and turning SpongeBob into his personal slave (even forcing him to wear a maid's uniform). While SpongeBob doesn't completely lose his temper, he snaps a bit and drops some very obvious hints that Squidward should go look for a job already. The latter refuses to take said hints, though, so SpongeBob furiously takes Squidward, still in bed, all the way to the Krusty Krab. He tries to convince Mr. Krabs to hire Squidward back, and when that didn't work, the sponge finally snaps, outright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeckLift">Neck Lifts</a> Krabs, and shakes him while screaming at him over how stupid the situation is:
<div class="indent"><strong>SpongeBob</strong>: Listen, you crustaceous cheapskate! Squidward's been living at my house driving me <em>crazy</em>! <em>And you're not gonna hire him back <strong>ALL BECAUSE OF A STUPID DIME?!</strong></em>
</div></li><li> In "Krusty Love," Mr. Krabs brings him along on his date with Mrs. Puff and puts him in charge of his money to make sure he doesn't spend it all, but he nonetheless keeps demanding that SpongeBob buy increasingly unnecessary items for Mrs. Puff, all while lashing out at him for spending his money when he was the one who asked him to do so in the first place. When Mr. Krabs <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverMyFault">declares that SpongeBob is "loose with other people's money"</a>, SpongeBob finally snaps, goes off on an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angrish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Angrish">Angrish</a> rant towards Krabs (heavily implied to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClusterFBomb">swear words</a>), and storms off, muttering to himself angrily.
</li><li> In "Stuck in the Wringer", SpongeBob gets glued to his wringer no thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LethallyStupid">Patrick</a> and continuously gets humiliated and injured in the process. After Patrick sends SpongeBob flying out the Tilt-A-Whirl and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwantedAssistance">offers him cotton candy</a> (which SpongeBob cannot eat in the first place, as he could'nt eat ice cream with the wringer on), SpongeBob snaps and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheReasonYouSuckSpeech">tells Patrick to go away and leave him alone</a>. Unfortunately, the Bikini Bottomites who witnessed this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOutToBeAJerkass">misinterpret it as bullying</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamedByAMob" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamedByAMob">send SpongeBob into a depression by claiming he deserves what happened to him</a>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>SpongeBob:</strong> That's nice, Patrick, but I don't want any cotton candy.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Patrick:</strong> Well, have some. It'll make you feel better.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>SpongeBob:</strong> I said I don't want any!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Patrick:</strong> You ruined my cotton candy!
</div><div class="indent"><strong>SpongeBob:</strong> <em><strong>GOOD!! </strong></em> Maybe now you know how I feel about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuddenlyShouting">YOU RUINING MY LIFE!!</a></em>
</div></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> episode "Rocko's Happy Sack" has Rocko enduring a massive <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumiliationConga">Humiliation Conga</a> just to take advantage of a super sale at a grocery store. He makes the deadline, but it switches over to the normal total thanks to Filbert's slowness. Rocko completely flips his lid and vows that if Filbert doesn't fix the total he will do something "not nice".
</li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KimPossible">Kim Possible</a></em> involves Ron being crowned Homecoming King and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Bonnie</a> being crowned Queen. Bonnie then proceeds to take every opportunity to flirt with Ron in front of Kim (who is Ron's girlfriend at this point). Kim bears it patiently...until Bonnie forces a kiss on Ron. Kim's ensuing rage (and the unspoken threat of a teen-hero beatdown) is so alarming that it drives Bonnie to tears.
</li><li> The stress of command finally gets to Optimus Prime during the first season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em>. Facing the threat of a Decepticon invasion, his subordinates decide that's the best moment to let him know that they disobeyed him and helped the Dinobots escape. On top of that Sari and Bumblebee are using <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmplifierArtifact">her key</a> to play with toys in the middle of briefing. After his initial blow up, he spends the rest of the episode cold and authoritarian only to learn that this leadership style is just making things worse. And then Megatron revives.
<ul><li> Also happens in the first season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersPrime">Transformers: Prime</a></em> when Megatron has the nerve to chuckle about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldHurtAChild">unintentionally putting Raf in a coma.</a> Optimus spent much of the first season still attempting to reach out to Megatron. In response to this, Optimus delievers a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> to the Decepticon leader and abandons all attempts at a dialogue with him.
<ul><li> While Ratchet is normally curt and grouchy, he only really blows up twice in the series. The first is due to personality altering steroids. The second is in response to the loss of the Omega Lock and with it any hope of reviving Cybertron. His critique of Optimus's leadership is scathing and he falls into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon">Despair Event Horizon</a> shortly afterward.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Moment of Truth", Entrapta tells Catra that going through with Hordak's plan to open an interdimensional portal would cause the universe to collapse, just as Adora said. This leads to one <em>hell</em> of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Villainous Breakdown</a>, in which she decides to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">destroy the universe</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMustNotWin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XMustNotWin">if it means destroying Adora along with it</a></span>.

</div><ul><li> In season 4, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Double Trouble tells Hordak that Catra exiled Entrapta to Beast Island. Hordak, who has romantic feelings for Entrapta, <em>immediately</em> goes berserk and tries to kill Catra.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CatDog">CatDog</a></em> Cat is the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">The Chew Toy</a>, often suffering horribly for no reason at all and being screwed over by most of the cast. In one episode, when said characters who had screwed him over subject him to even more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmusingInjuries">Amusing Injuries</a> after Dog drags him into participating in a monster truck rally, Cat does his best to stay calm... until the audience calls him loser, at which point he snaps and goes into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">Unstoppable Rage</a>, utterly destroying everyone in the arena, culminating in him destroying the Greasers monster truck with a single punch.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CentralPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CentralPark">Central Park</a></em>, Season 1 "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CentralParkS1E7SquirrelInterrupted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/CentralParkS1E7SquirrelInterrupted">Squirrel, Interrupted</a>", while on the "squavenger hunt" based around Cole's favorite books, <em>The Squirrel Quarrels</em>, Owen keeps complaining about the details in books not making sense, which frustrates Cole. And as Birdie states later on, he went "too damn far" when he complains about the squirrels becoming dinosaurs in one book and saying squirrels didn't evolved from them. Cole gets fed up and abandons Owen to continue the "squavenger hunt" with Enrique.
