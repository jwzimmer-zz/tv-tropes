</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> Magellan, the prison warden of Impel Down. During Luffy's escape from prison, Magellan chases them the entire time, and it gets to the point that anybody that's caught by him is considered already dead as the prisoners run away from him, so what starts out as a riot of 5 floors and thousands of prisoners leads to less than 300 making it out alive. It's not that he's just unreasonably tough: his power is producing large amounts of poison, so that even touching him is suicide.
</li><li> Though with that said, he did shrug off blows from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentPeacock">Emporio</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyAwesome">Ivankov</a>, which appeared to have bruised him up a bit but otherwise fine. He also took multiple cannon-fire like a cake-walk.
</li><li> Soon after Admiral Akainu gives Magellan a serious run for his money. Like Magellan, touching him is suicide (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagmaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagmaMan">made of lava</a>), like Magellan he gives chase to the protagonists and no one seems to be able to stop him, only buy a little time before being defeated, and <em>unlike</em> Magellan <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's actually made good on his promise to not let anyone escape by actually killing Ace.</span>
</li><li> Due to being partially inspired by the Terminator, Bartholomew Kuma fits here, being an incredibly resilient cyborg and being able to redirect anything you throw at him. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Teleportation">short range teleportation</a> and his primary method of movement being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowWalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowWalk">The Slow Walk</a> just makes it <em>worse.</em>
</li><li> Luffy's rubber body and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator nature</a> gave him shades of this, particularly when upset. His fight against Arlong and more so against Enel — whose powers were useless against Luffy — are good examples where he kept coming after them. Lately he's lost this status and went to full Determinator since everybody they fight has a power that can hurt him. Notably, Luffy was very much this to Rob Lucci during their fight. Late during said fight, Lucci hits Luffy with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretArt">Rokuougan</a> technique not once, not twice, but <em>three times</em>! The second one floored Luffy and it took Usopp giving him a speech to stand up and fight, which gives him a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSecondWind">Heroic Second Wind</a>, but not before declaring to Lucci that he'll never fall to the ground again until he defeats him. Then, he gets hit by the third Rokuougan and it looks like it did the job, as we see Luffy collapsing... then <em>stubbornly catches his footing</em> and with his last burst of strength, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperationAttack">desperately unleashes Jet Gatling</a>. Luffy defeats Lucci with this powerful attack (putting the latter <em>into a coma</em>) and surely enough, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostVictoryCollapse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PostVictoryCollapse">falls to the ground shortly after</a>.
</li><li> Smoker is like this to Luffy pre-Timeskip, back before Luffy could hurt Logia-types, and Smoker pursued Luffy relentlessly whenever their paths crossed and they weren't forced into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">Enemy Mine</a> scenario.
</li><li> Mihawk was this to Krieg's crew — he single-handedly sank most of his 50-ship fleet, leaving the remains of his crew fleeing from Grand Line on the last remaining ship. Then he proceeds to track them down and cut their last ship in half — and all of it, just because he was bored. If Zoro didn't call him on a duel (thus giving him enough entertainment), he would probably finish them off. He comes back to that role in the Marineford, in which his fight with main character consists him barely putting effort into attack, while main character <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">desperately trying to stay alive</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Zombieman from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em> is this, and it's what gave him a spot in the S-Class despite not having the physical attributes to compete with the other S-Class heroes. As a zombie, he <em>cannot die</em>, does not need to eat, sleep, breathe or drink. A monster "killed" him 200 times, and he simply got up the 201st time and came right back to kill it.
</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetopetoSan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PetopetoSan">Petopeto San</a></em> has a character named Nuriko, who is a <em>Nurikabe</em> — Essentially, a wall monster. She is made of concrete. She only gets mad once, but the only way to stop her forward progress was to shove her off of the stage she was on at the time.

No matter how many Aura Spheres Lucario chucks at them, and no matter how many passageways are knocked down, they just keep walking slowly, inevitably, towards the heroes. Especially interesting is the fact that they manage to be implacable even while being constantly pegged by their mutual weakness to Fighting-types.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonKyuremVSTheSwordOfJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonKyuremVSTheSwordOfJustice">Pokémon: Kyurem vs. The Sword of Justice</a></em>, fifteenth movie, runs with this trope and combines it with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator">Super-Persistent Predator</a> for the titular Kyurem. The mon, in a fit of rage at their opponent fleeing, goes on a hellish chase throughout a good part of Unova to find Keldeo, pulverizing and freezing anything that even gets in his way. Any attempts to so much as stall him are <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoSell">absolutely ineffective</a></em>.

Throughout the series, he has literally been smashed through solid concrete and through cliff walls and had the rubble collapse on top of him, only to emerge undaunted and continue to fight. More impressive, is his ability to traverse large distances on foot, in pursuit of his target and won't rest until he's caught up to them. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unhl3t6aJE0">Just ask Ranma.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>

He goes through the entire cast without stopping, takes a hit from the hero's strongest attack and stands back up, you name it. It takes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his own body overheating to kill him</span>. To be specific, he takes a direct punch from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Sanosuke</a>, hit <em>very</em> hard by Saito's in the forehead, and that's not even including Kenshin's attacks...

<ul><li> Noro, a strange and silent Ghoul working directly for Aogiri's leader. Even other ghouls consider his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> to be abnormal and his lack of reaction to damage disturbing. During the battle in the 11th Ward, he's pumped full of hundreds of rounds of ammunition without even reacting, and later is stabbed through the chest and then decapitated. He merely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullingThemselvesTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PullingThemselvesTogether">pulls himself together</a> and is only stopped because he's apparently called back by his superiors.

It's then revealed that Noro was actually a mummified body kept going by Eto's powers</span>.
</li><li> Kishou Arima, the legendary "undefeated" Ghoul Investigator. Rather than simply shrugging off injury, he seems capable of dodging literally <em>anything</em> thrown at him and leaves his targets with a literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunOrDie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunOrDie">Run or Die</a> scenario. Even the strongest of ghouls have no choice but to run as far and as fast as possible to survive an encounter with him. For this reason, ghouls call him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami">Shinigami</a> and consider him death incarnate.

A potent example is when Vash fires a clip of bullets at Knives. Knives turns the parts of his body where the bullets hit into <em>guns</em> and fires back. They both recover.
</li><li> Sato from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ajin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Ajin">Ajin</a></em> is technically nothing more than a human with military training who can't die (and can sometimes summon a sort of battle ghost), but his sociopathy and love of action are so extreme that he will do absolutely anything to get a thrill in battle. What makes him scary is his resourcefulness: try to kill him, lock him, incapacitate him, he <em>will</em> find a way to turn the table on you by some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyEnoughToWork">insane and unpredictable method</a> that takes advantage of his immortality. That includes <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">chopping his own hand, sending it in a food-delivery package to the building he wants to infiltrate, <em>grinding himself to smithereens in a wood-cutting machine</em>, and then reappearing inside the building when his body regenerates from the previously chopped-off hand.

He stands there and takes your best shot to show you that fighting him is pointless, then flies after you to show you that running is also pointless. Also, if you're attacking him, you're not attacking innocent people so it's worth the risk of taking the occasional punch that could hurt him. Unless you have a bit of kryptonite with you almost nothing can stop him.

Upon arriving in Hell, his soul was filled with so much hatred that it froze Hell solid, and when the Devil attempted to whip and beat the hate out of him, the Devil had to give up. The only way to get him out of Hell was to let him take over for the Angel of Death, who was tired of the job.

He doesn't ever need to stop to rest, or eat, he will massacre innocents without remorse or compassion, and if he is ordered to hunt you, nothing can save you.

<ul><li> Perhaps the most potent distillation: the title character of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Terminator">Terminator</a></em> series is a killing machine, as discussed in the page quote.
<ul><li> The key example occurs near the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTerminator">The Terminator</a></em>, where Kyle Reese manages to explode the fuel tanker truck that the Terminator is driving to try to destroy it. Immediately afterward, Kyle and Sarah Connor embrace with romantic music playing as they feel the crisis is over. However, the music abruptly changes back to ominous as the Terminator, now stripped to its endoskeleton frame, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheInferno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutOfTheInferno">arises from the flames</a> to shock both the heroes and the audience that the killer robot <strong>is still coming</strong>. Even after Kyle <strong>blows its legs off</strong>, the damn thing keeps crawling after Sarah with murderous intent, and as it's being crushed in a hydraulic press, it claws at her with its metallic skeletal hand to the very last.
</li><li> Taken to further extremes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator2JudgmentDay">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a></em>, where the T-1000 gets frozen by liquid nitrogen and breaks into a million pieces...and <em>still</em> survives to continue pursuing the heroes<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1hhvt');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1hhvt" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1hhvt');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">in the special edition, however, it sustained some damage to its shapeshifting ability due to getting frozen</span>; he also manages to continue running at the same speed as a reversing car while being shot repeatedly with a pistol. Moreso with Sarah Connor's attack on Dyson's home, where she all but becomes a Terminator herself and is halfway to shooting a defenceless, wounded man dead in front of his wife and family.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Terminator3RiseOfTheMachines">Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines</a></em> takes the trope even <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">further</a></em> with the T-X, which treats giant electromagnets, rocket launchers and a beating from Arnold Schwarzenegger with nothing more than mild annoyance. When the T-850 hits her with a military helicopter, crushing her underneath it and reducing her to a legless torso, she keeps going in true Terminator fashion.

In the few scenes where a driver can be discerned, Loftin's face is not seen.</span> No matter what Mann does to elude and shake his antagonist, the truck is always on his tail, at times speeding well above the speed limit or at a speed that is reasonably safe or what the car — a 1970 Plymouth Valiant sedan, presumably with the basic 6-cylinder engine — can endure, the driver (or the truck-with-a-mind-of-its-own(?) itself) seeming to want to brutally kill him for some unknown reason. In the end, just as Mann's car is about to break down and all hope seems lost, Mann finally is able to stage an accident at the edge of a cliff, and the truck — which heretofore had seemingly been smarter than Mann — falls for the trick, plunging over the side to its doom.
</li><li> The titular <em>It</em> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItFollows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItFollows">It Follows</a></em>. A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanoidAbomination">vaguely humanoid</a> <em>thing</em> that hunts down and kills whoever is cursed with it, before moving on to the second most recent cursed person, then the next, then the next, and so on. It takes the form of random people, and nothing can kill it or permanently disable it. More a force of nature than a thinking creature (though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItCanThink">It Can Think</a> when it needs to), it never moves at a pace faster than a slow walk, and no matter how far the person it's chasing runs, they'll always get tired eventually.
</li><li> The Tall Man from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phantasm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phantasm">Phantasm</a></em> films. He can make you hallucinate that you killed him only to come back to torment you. He's telekinetic and super-strong, so it doesn't matter if you're close to him or not, he can still get you and cause your weapons to misfire or remove them from your grasp. Cut off parts of him and those parts will each become miniature monsters that will make your life hell. Freeze him and his head will release an unstoppable golden sentinel sphere. Finally you've somehow managed to burn him with fire, acid or blow him up, and his smoking corpse is on the ground, and you can take a breath....only to have an identical Tall Man step out of a dimensional doorway who picks up the corpse of the previous Tall Man and hurls it back through the portal, and then takes over immediately where the previous one left off. Did we also mention that he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a> who can undo his own defeats, and has an ever-growing legion of the undead and alien technology at his command?
</li><li> Gabriel Byrne's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Satan">Satan</a> character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndOfDays" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EndOfDays">End of Days</a></em> (also starring Ahnold, this time as the human hero). He possesses the body of a stock broker, who proves impervious to bullets and other blunt trauma. He's eventually worn down by repeated explosive blasts and being mowed down by a subway train. When he can no longer walk, he simply leaves the broker's body and possesses a new one. In the end, Satan isn't beaten, only outlasted as the New Year rings in, and he's forced to retreat for another 1000 years.

</li><li> For that matter, Bond himself. Especially in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DanielCraig">Daniel Craig</a> films he gets some truly epic chase scenes.

</div></li><li> Probably the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood">least potent</a> film distillation: Ro-Man, the title character of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BMovie">B-Movie</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobotMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobotMonster">Robot Monster</a></em>. All of our weapons have failed to kill it, and it's wiped out all of humanity, save about seven people. Under some circumstances, such feats would be really scary. However, since Ro-Man is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialEffectsFailure">a gorilla in a space helmet</a>, this isn't one of those circumstances.
</li><li> Agent Smith (and the other Agents) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em>. Not only are Agents ridiculously powerful and ridiculously hard to kill, but if you do manage to kill one, all the Agent needs to do is find another human to possess in order to continue trying to take you down. There's a reason that standard Resistance procedure before Neo came along was to "run your ass off" when an Agent showed up.
</li><li> Mal from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Inception">Inception</a></em> is a character that suddenly invades dream worlds and attempts to assassinate the dreamer. In a sense she's even worse than her counterpart Agent Smith in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheMatrix">The Matrix</a></em> movies in that she doesn't need to possess anyone, she just appears and wreaks havoc. What's really scary is that even in constructed dream worlds with trained dream operators, she's nearly impossible to stop.
</li><li> Played for laughs with the random assassin in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowersTheSpyWhoShaggedMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AustinPowersTheSpyWhoShaggedMe">Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</a></em>: she survived a knife in the back, a dozen bullets shot in the back, a shot from a bazooka in the face, and a ridiculously high fall out of a window with Austin landing on top of her.

</li><li> The Beast from the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KungFuHustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KungFuHustle">Kung Fu Hustle</a></em>. Takes being punched through walls and flattened into the ground and still keeps going.

Takes a few beat-downs, but stands up again regardless (though his attempts to be truly implacable fail spectacularly when he swallows too much of his own blood and makes himself sick.)
</li><li> The titular <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pumpkinhead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pumpkinhead">Pumpkinhead</a></em> is this, as it's a monster conjured forth by the rage and grief of the one that summons it, and will stop at <em>nothing</em> to brutally kill the targets of its conjurer's ire. The only means to stop it prior to completing its task is to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantLiveWithoutYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantLiveWithoutYou">kill the one that summoned it</a></span>.

He is based on the Russian character from the original comics, who is a lot more talkative, but just as supremely strong and relentless; he was only defeated when the Punisher <em>suffocated him under his obese neighbour</em> and then cut off his head, but he <em>still</em> came back after having his head reattached and his skeleton augmented with powerful metal alloys (he also received a pair of breasts due to hormone injections, which he took in stride by actually dressing up like a woman on occasions).
</li><li> Another bulletproof Russian (Uzbekistani) appears in the movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Snatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Snatch">Snatch.</a></em>, and hilarity ensues. Even when not dodging bullets, he manages to survive being hit directly by a car travelling at high speed with no real injury, then taking almost a full magazine from a desert eagle at the hands of Bullet-Tooth Tony, all while yelling "fuck you!" with each bullet that Tony puts in him. It's heavily implied by his tenacity that he would have survived if the frustrated Tony hadn't used his last bullet for a well-aimed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadShot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadShot">headshot</a>.

Despite being shot numerous times with automatic weapons, he doesn't flinch and kills every one of his would-be assassins. Only a double-barrel shotgun blast delivered from behind at point-blank range is enough to finally take Tony down.
</li><li> Jason Voorhees from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FridayThe13th">Friday the 13th</a></em> movies is nearly impossible to stop, and it's always temporary.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JasonX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JasonX">Jason X</a></em> adds a more heroic Implacable Man to the mix with Sgt.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FreddyVsJason">Freddy vs. Jason</a></em>, Jason proves how implacable he is during a fight in dream world — despite being near-omnipotent in dream world, Freddy finds himself unable to kill Jason, before discovering his hydrophobia.

Shown clearly in <em>Like A Mighty Army</em>, in a form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MookHorrorShow">Mook Horror Show</a>.
</li><li> The Cauldron-Born in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfPrydain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfPrydain">The Chronicles of Prydain</a></em>; they are invulnerable, and all strategies for dealing with them revolve around drawing them away from Annuvin (because they grow weaker when outside it) or delaying them. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end it is revealed that they can be killed by Dyrnwyn, the black sword.</span> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron">The Black Cauldron</a></em>, that Implacable <em>Army</em> can only be defeated by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> of someone jumping into the titular cauldron (which is fatal).
</li><li> Shrike from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MortalEngines">Mortal Engines</a></em>, last of the Lazarus Brigade, survives being shot and stabbed (a lot), being blown up, being <em>run over by a mobile city</em>, and ten thousand years of entropy.
</li><li> A definite candidate for this trope is Verroq, the 'bearded mercenary' from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBartimaeusTrilogy">The Bartimaeus Trilogy</a></em> who, though a prominent baddie, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep">is only named in the last book</a>. He survives... well, anything and everything, really. Bartimaeus himself puts it best:
<div class="indent"><strong>Bartimaeus:</strong> "Whether I squished him under a statue, blew him up with a Detonation or (as in our last encounter) simply set him on fire and hurled him down a mountainside, he never seemed to suffer the slightest injury."
</div></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> book <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoingPostal">Going Postal</a></em>:
<ul><li> Having one of these sent after him (in the form of Mr. Pump, a golem) is what convinces Moist von Lipwig to give in and serve as postmaster. "You need to eat; Mr.Pump does not. You need to sleep; Mr.Pump does not". Golems do have a weakness, though: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">they can handle fire, and they can handle water, but being living clay, they can't handle both at the same time</span>.
</li><li> Another, earlier golem example comes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FeetOfClay">Feet of Clay</a></em>, in which Angua remarks that, despite its cracks, the golem <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">king</span> would probably keep attacking even if it became nothing more than floating dust.
</li><li> The Luggage. Even if you go to the ends of the earth, the Luggage will be heading there with its hundreds of tiny feet. (It's also rather vicious.) It will follow you to the beginning of time or its end, into another dimension, or through the gates of Hell itself, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">utterly destroying whoever and whatever gets in its way</a>.
</li><li> And a human example: Sam Vimes. "As far as they're concerned, <em><strong>I</strong></em> am far-reaching consequences!" Yes, he is. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Thud">Thud!</a></em> his usual unstoppable determination is augmented by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">an ancient quasi-demonic spirit of vengeance</span> which makes him, briefly, the scariest being on the Disc.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanSteam">Older Than Steam</a>: In book V of Edmund Spenser's 1596 poem, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFaerieQueene">The Faerie Queene</a></em>, Talus, the iron sidekick with a penchant for incredibly violent justice, proves unstoppable by any of his enemies.
</li><li> Many <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeanKoontz">Dean Koontz</a> antagonists fit this trope to a T. If they want the heroes they will hunt them, and hunt them, and hunt them until they are killed or incapacitated. Often very competent and capable of tracking their quarry through their connections. But thankfully the same can be said of the protagonists, whose spirit to live and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivineIntervention">Divine Intervention</a> save the day.
</li><li> In Glen Cook's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBlackCompany">The Black Company</a></em> books, all magic users tend to be hard to kill, but the worst by far is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the Limper</span>. For starters he gets stabbed a few hundred times, hacked apart, mutilated, knocked out of the sky, then <em>decapitated</em>. It doesn't stop him. Eventually he is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> shredded to tiny pieces and boiled in a giant pressure cooker, and the gooey mass of flesh and gore</span> <em>still</em> breaks out and tries to keep going.
</li><li> In Glen Cook's Petty Pewter Gods, one of the Garrett series, "Nog is Inescapable."
</li><li> Vago, the golem from <em>Storm Thief</em>. Not only is the guy next to impossible to harm with conventional weaponry, Revenants, which instantly kill everything else by brushing up against them die the instant they touch him, and give him energy. Granted, he was designed to kill them, so that bit is justified.
</li><li> Croup and Vandemar in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Neverwhere">Neverwhere</a></em>, who cannot be killed and doggedly pursue the heroes until the end.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>, in the Book of Job, mentions a "leviathan" and "behemoth" that apparently shrug off all human attempts to subdue them, at least if the quite literal <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is to be trusted.
</li><li> Rare hero example: Roland of Gilead, protagonist of Stephen King's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDarkTower">The Dark Tower</a></em> series, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGunslinger">the first book</a>.
</li><li> The gods of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Everworld">Everworld</a> series are, not surprisingly, rather hard to kill. You know, being gods and all. However, what is required to actually kill them varies according to book. At first, they can be killed only by another god or the weapon of a god. Period. Later on, it is said that Hel could've been vanquished by an enchanted sword, and one character says that a fall into a crater the group is at would kill even an immortal. Nonetheless, gods are stabbed with swords, cut with blades, and shot full of arrows with little effect over the course of the books. It is possible that the books' Coo-Hatch steel could kill an immortal, however.
</li><li> The Warrior Bugs from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarshipTroopers">Starship Troopers</a></em>, at least according to Johnnie. It takes losing all four limbs on one side to topple one, and it's not out of commission till the nerve case is damaged. If it hasn't been toppled by then, it can still charge forward until it bumps into something like a wall.
</li><li> The Steel Inquisitors of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy">Mistborn: The Original Trilogy</a> can only be killed by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> decapitation or pulling out the metal spike embedded in their back</span> — they'll recover almost instantly from anything else. Their boss, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">the Lord Ruler</a>, is <em>even tougher</em> — prior to the beginning of the book he had reportedly been stabbed, shot, decapitated, burned and <em>flayed alive</em> and shrugged it all off like nothing. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> says the decapitation was an exaggeration, he was only partially decapitated and would have died if he'd actually been completely decapitated.
</li><li> Hyde from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangeCaseOfDrJekyllAndMrHyde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStrangeCaseOfDrJekyllAndMrHyde">The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></em> is a chilling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructedTrope">deconstruction</a> of this. Although we don't see him shrug off lots of damage, the point is made clearly — if absolutely, positively nothing is going to stop you, then surely that must include even the innocent little girl who just got in your way. Which is indeed what happens when Hyde callously walks onto her. In the face of this monstrous behaviour the observers are disgusted.
</li><li> Several characters from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a>, but most notably Cowl, whom <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a fallen angel-powered Harry flipped a car onto and it did <em>nothing</em></span>.

Also Nicodemus. He gets shot full of a full cylinder of bullets without even flinching. After the second bullet he actually started making the quintessential "can we hurry it up" gesture.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em> has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> example. Sure, the Man in Black is technically just an ordinary human without any superpowers or invulnerability, but... When following Buttercup's kidnappers, he outraces the fastest ship in the land, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimbingTheCliffsOfInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClimbingTheCliffsOfInsanity">climbs the original Cliffs Of Insanity</a>, even after they cut the rope, beats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman">Inigo Montoya</a> in a duel, wrestles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">Fezzik</a> unconscious, and finally <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">deliberately drinks poison without suffering any effects</span> to beat Vizzini in cunning.

The illusion is shattered when anti-tank weaponry is brought out, though.

From what we've seen of the Jaghut Tyrants they also count, as do Annomander Rake and many of the series other badass characters.
</li><li> The Golem of Flesh, Everyman from the Way of the Tiger gamebook series. Everytime you killed him, he would reappear, repeating his line "I am Everyman." After the first few fights, even if you took no damage(through fudging the dice, or just being really good at rolling them), you'd still lose hitpoints on each subsequent attempts, as "exhaustion" kicked in. The only way to get away from him: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Lure him to a cliff and make him fall. Incidentally, said cliff leads to hordes of monsters who will gladly keep him occupied for eternity.</span>

It follows him everywhere, even between dimensions, constructing a new body from whatever's handy (trash, stray cats, parts of a homeless guy, whatever). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In the end, it <em>can't</em> be stopped from carrying out its mission — but it can be sidetracked onto the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnfanteTerrible">Enfante Terrible</a> for whom the changeling protagonist was switched at birth.</span>

</li><li> Nearly any greater dead or free magic construct in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OldKingdom">Old Kingdom</a></em> trilogy unless you have exactly the skills and equipment needed to handle them, and any of the dead are this when faced with modern weaponry.
<ul><li> There are also the skeleton soldiers from <em>The Titan's Curse</em>, who chase the heroes across the country <em>on foot</em> and can only be stopped by <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> children of Hades</span>.

Green</a>'s Verse, the Walking Man is an agent of holy wrath who cannot be stopped by any force short of divinity. Anyone who becomes one will believe God is backing his play, and he'll be <em>right</em>.
<ul><li> It's possible that the Walking Man is more powerful than even other gods, as The Punk God of the Straight Razor <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">went toe to toe with him and still got his ass kicked in the end.</span>
</li><li> Note that the Walking Man's invulnerability and powers <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">only last as the Walking Man is punishing sinners. As soon as he tries to kill an innocent, he becomes a mortal man again.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The Lifeless in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Warbreaker">Warbreaker</a></em> are an implacable <em>army</em>. They're essentially zombies that are perfectly obedient to whoever has the authority to command them. As such, they're completely fearless, completely tireless, don't need to eat, and can shrug off any injury as long as it doesn't directly impair their functioning. Furthermore, though they lose their free will they <em>do</em> retain learned skills, so where other undead would just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a>, Lifeless who were soldiers in life are fully capable of using advanced combat techniques and tactics. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Taken <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with Kalad's Phantom's, legendary ultra-Lifeless created as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMooks">Elite Mooks</a> by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorcerousOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorcerousOverlord">Sorcerous Overlord</a> and ultimately revealed to be composed of skeletons sealed inside solid stone, making them all but impossible to destroy.

<ul><li> Pathruushkè further demonstrates Cophthera-gn's implacability by <em>stabbing him through the face with his staff</em>, then pulling it right back out. Not only does Cophthera-gn heal within seconds, he doesn't even <em>flinch</em>.

You can run away, you can fend it off, you can even trap it inside a heavy box, but the assassin's dagger will keep catching up with you at multiple points throughout the adventure. If you don't find a way to banish it before the end of the book then it will sneak up on you and bury itself in your back just as you confront the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a>.
</li><li> Arenad from <em>Fallen Moon</em>, at least in book three. After suffering multiple mortal injuries, he is eventually killed by drinking a bottle of the deadliest poison in universe. He gets better in a few days. For some examples, he was turned into a human pincushion, fell off a mountain, starved to death, likely broke his neck a few times, and stabbed through the heart twice, one of which was with a magic BFS designed by a <em>god</em> to kill him.
</li><li> In a collection of Pacific Coast Indian folktales there was one in which a group of hunters find that the "old woman" who took shelter from the winter in their lodge is actually a brain-eating monster. They hit it on the head with a hatchet, then burn the lodge with its body inside. Thye then led it on a chase across the country-side, setting traps for it as they go until they finally lure it onto thin ice and it falls through, and was presumably released again come spring. Since there were no other versions of the story from other tribes it was probably made up on the spot by a storyteller who would have been writing for Hollywood except it was the 19th century.

And it never, ever, gives up on its target.

<ul><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Kane">Kane</a> first debuted, he was implacable. He no-sold <em>everything</em>, and his first two matches were one-sided squashes against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/MickFoley">Mankind</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Vader" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Vader">Vader</a>. It took <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheUndertaker">The Undertaker</a> three tombstone piledrivers to beat him, and he had to do a leg hook pinfall instead of his usual pose pinfall.
</li><li> Many "monster" heels probably count; no-selling and squashing their way to victory, up until the point a top-level face <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable">eventually defeats them</a>.
</li><li> The Undertaker himself tended to be one such implacable man, regardless of his alignment, and defeating him tended to be treated as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatingTheUndefeatable">Defeating the Undefeatable</a>. He best exemplified this trait during <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em> and <em>WrestleMania</em> season, when his streak was on the line. Ending said streak was said to be the holy grail, an accomplishment greater than winning a world championship, and a one-way ticket to the Hall of Fame. However, Undertaker seemed to be almost divinely empowered on Wrestlemania, shrugging off finishers, weapon shots, and anything that would in any other situation be a match ender.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note46hcb');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note46hcb" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note46hcb');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">This event extended to a WWE videogame which had a special 'Break The Streak' match, where you fight a special powered up Undertaker who is explicitly an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SNKBoss">SNK Boss</a>.</span> Perhaps the greatest example would be Wrestlemania 28, where he ate a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ShawnMichaels">Shawn Michaels</a> Superkick and then IMMEDIATELY was hit by a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">Triple H</a> Pedigree.

</li><li> Abyss gets cast in this role quite often. For a long time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TNA">TNA</a> put him in matches where he would take bumps on thumbtacks, barbed wire, broken glass, etc. and he would just keep coming.

This <em>did</em> make Elgin bend over, but he didn't let go of Kazarian and stood right back up with him. Daniels then manually pulled Kazarian down but Elgin ended up pulling both of them to finally complete the suplex.

<ul><li> A race of Implacable Men: the robotic Necrons, who can stand back up after anything — which in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> universe <em>starts</em> at being riddled with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrickinLaserBeams">lasers</a> capable of blowing limbs off, crushed by artillery rounds the size of houses and having your head bitten off by daemonically possessed super-soldiers. Even after getting dismembered horribly, or getting turned to slag, some Necrons will get back up, and some specialist wargear means they just. Won't. DIE! The special rule for this is called: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">We'll Be Back</a></em>.
</li><li> As an organization, the Imperial Guard largely fits this trope. Their doctrine combines a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">willingness to spend human lives like ammunition</a> with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">fundamental religious devotion to utterly, completely crushing their enemies in the name of the God-Emperor of Man in spite of any losses</a> to create this titanic, unstoppable juggernaut of raw manpower and machinery that absorbs casualties and hammers its opponents with sheer, overwhelming force until they break.
</li><li> Commissar Yarrik is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> example of this. He lost his arm fighting against an Ork warboss, but still managed to kill him, tear off his power claw and hold it triumphantly in front of the Ork army, causing them to flee in panic. Only then did he pass out. Later he also got his eye shot out and replaced with a bionic implant when his command tank exploded. He's dedicated his life to hunting down the Ork warlord Ghazkull Thraka and seems to have no intention of stopping despite being an old man by now. He even has a special rule similar to the Necrons "We'll Be Back", where on 3+ he simply refuses to die and stands back up with one wound. It's hinted that the Orks have seen him crush their armies so many times that they've started to view him as unkillable, and since Orks run on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">Clap Your Hands If You Believe</a>, their belief is <em>making</em> him unkillable. Notably, Games Workshop always gives his models a slight greenish tinge in their official painting.
</li><li> Second edition 40k had different rules for armor saves, with base armor and save modifiers. This means that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Terminator</a> armor, at present only failing a save on a 1 on a d6 (except for armor-ignoring guns and melee weapons), used to roll two dice and fail only on snake-eyes. Even if hit by the biggest weapons in the game, they would be unscathed on rolling 9+ on two dice. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Abaddon the Despoiler</a> ramped this up into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwinnableByDesign">Unwinnable by Design</a> territory by the fact that he saved on a 2 on 2d6. Unless you had a meaty gun that imposed modifiers on the save roll, you would always save.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarines">Space Marines</a> in the WH40k universe are examples of this trope. Not only do they have redundant organs, they can go into a (controlled) coma to repair damage. Their blood clots instantly, and their armour dispenses painkillers and stimulant drugs as a backup. One example had a Marine keep fighting after getting his arm blown off and <em>his molten armour fused to his side</em> by an energy fire. This example is relatively mundane compared to some of the stuff a Space Marine can push through.
</li><li> Chaos God <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plaguemaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Plaguemaster">Nurgle's</a> servants typically fill this trope within the 40k 'verse. They are so riddled with plagues and blight that they're in too much pain to feel anything <em>other</em> pain, and pumped full of morbid vitality (to <em>survive</em> their diseases) that they can survive more than anything has right to. The combination makes for units that are incredibly hard to kill, whether it be plague cultists, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">Nurglite daemons</a>, or the notorious Plague Marines. Most Nurglite forces employ a slow-and-steady combat doctrine with a certain emphasis on overwhelming the enemy by trading blows and simply outsurviving the enemy.
</li><li> The Rubric Marines used by the Thousand Sons Legion are also this. Thanks to a spell cast on them, they are essentially possessed suits of power armour and are nigh invulnerable — you have to literally blow them apart to stop them.
</li><li> Even the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">relatively flimsy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceElves">Eldar</a> become like this when the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Avatar of Khaine</a> is summoned. Each and every one of them is overtaken by a kind of psychotic bloodlust when they see him up and walking about.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GURPS">GURPS</a></em> has an Advantage called "Supernatural Durability" which makes you immune to all shock, stun, &amp; knockout. As long as you have positive health you are immune to crippling injuries and have full move. With negative HP you have half move and can be crippled. You can only be killed in two ways: by an attack which does 10 * your maximum HP, or by using an item you're weak against and reducing you below -5* HP. For comparison A normal human has half move and dodge below 1/3 of their health. Below 0 HP they must make a roll each turn or fall unconscious, and must make rolls to not die at -1* HP, -2* HP, -3* HP, -4* HP. At -5* HP you die immediately, no save.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>:
<ul><li> game has this built right in—sort of. In earlier editions, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalExistenceFailure">characters simply had hit points and died only when they reached 0</a>. Characters could be hurt, but they generally weren't bothered by it unless an effect also had a condition attached to it. Later editions made it <em>slightly</em> more believable, as once you reached 0 or lower, you simply dropped unconscious, and if you were at below 0, you bled out until you reached -10, at which point death ensued, but included abilities that allowed a person to be a true implacable man, able to take full actions while at negative points, until they reached -10 and keeled over.
</li><li> One particular class, the Frenzied Berserker, takes it a step further. They are capable of completely ignoring negative hit points, even below -10, while they are frenzying. They can easily hit double- or triple-digit negatives, and if a skilled (or lucky) healer manages to get enough spells off to return them to positive hit points before the end of the frenzy, they come out none the worse for wear. The only effects that can kill them in this state are the ones that don't deal hit point damage, like suffocation or instant-death spells. The cost for this ability is that they are required to continually attack, and if they run out of enemies they start chewing through allies... <br/>Although if you want him to be near unkillable, you need a necklace that makes it so magic that instantly kills you doesn't work, a stone that makes it so you don't need to breathe, and finally to double up on a magic ring that makes it so — should something kill you and you'd get a save against it — you can choose to delay it for one minute, nine times for one ring. Hopefully you don't accrue enough damage that your cleric can't heal you within 180 rounds.
</li><li> Add on a <em>Ring of Regeneration</em>, and you'd have someone unkillable except by having the hand with the ring chopped off and incinerated or dissolved in acid after the above is done. (This Ring prevents death from anything except spells that directly cause death as long as it stays on your finger. While fire and acid damage cannot be regenerated, as long as you're still alive they will heal back at the base rate of 1 hp per day. Obviously, if you no longer have fingers, you can't keep wearing it...)
</li><li> The Tarrasque: regeneration 40, magic-reflecting carapace, 840 hit points (this in a game where even the luckiest — as in, win the lottery several times — non-epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">tank</a> will have no more than 600, and then only for short bursts at a time), and immunities to everything under the sun. Not only that, but to kill it, you have to reduce it anywhere from negative 10 to negative 40 (depending on edition) hitpoints <em>and</em> subsequently cast <em>wish</em> or <em>miracle</em> — generally the most powerful non-epic spells in the game — to make him <em>stay</em> that way...for awhile.
</li><li> To top that, the Tarrasque can flat out not be killed in 4th edition DnD. Instead he can only be driven back to the center of the earth to slumber.
</li><li> A revenant is the victim of a cruel, unjust demise who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">gets back up</a> to seek revenge against whoever killed them. Not needing food, air, or sleep, it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanRunButYouCantHide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanRunButYouCantHide">always knows</a> the direction of and distance to its target (even if the two are on <em>different planes of existence</em>) and will pursue them nonstop. It regenerates damage, and even if its body is destroyed it will just enter another corpse after 24 hours and keep going. The only things that will end its pursuit are the target's death, it running out of time (about one year), or, in 5th Edition, casting a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique">Wish</a></em> spell to force the soul to move on while it's out of a body.
</li><li> From the <em>Elder Evils</em> sourcebook is Zargon The Returner, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> that sucks up damage almost as well as the Tarrasque. Unlike the Tarrasque, though, even if you actually kill him he'll just grow back around his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">indestructible horn</a> within a few <em>days</em>. The only way to keep him down for good is to destroy his horn, and good luck with that.
</li><li> Inevitables are Terminator expies—extraplanar constructs that enforce universal law, combining the relentless single-mindedness of a machine with the intelligence to plan ahead and strategize. On top of that, destroying one will only make the forges back on its home plane reassemble it, and send it back in with the exact same mission and whatever added knowledge the last one managed to provide. Fortunately, they usually don't seek to kill, only to enforce whatever law was broken, and will punish accordingly, usually by forcing compliance through magic or handing the culprit over to local authorities. Of course, if it's the kind that punishes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker">grave dodgers</a>, you're probably out of luck: it'll beat you to death right then and there.
</li><li> The recently-released "Heroes of Shadow" supplement added in <em>vampire</em> as a class. You start with only <em>two</em> Healing Surges (normal characters range from 6 for a particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquishyWizard">Squishy Wizard</a> to 15+ for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy">The Big Guy</a>), but when you bloody or kill a foe, you can suck their blood to gain an extra healing surge. If you end a fight with more healing surges than your base, the excess burn off and you're instantly at full health. Oh, also, you do not fall unconscious when at negative hit points, but you DO have to make death-saving-throws, and you CAN still die if reduced to negative half your health (which is instant death for anyone else.) That said, a fair GM will rightly have the last remaining enemies of a fight soiling themselves in terror as everything else on the battlefield is dead or dying, yet this one mutilated, bloody thing that has been tearing their comrades apart with bare claws and teeth is <em>still coming at them</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SeventhSea">7th Sea</a></em>, there is the "Man of Will" advantage, rendering one immune to any mind-altering magic, immune to fear, immune to the effects of the Repartee system (ie, no one can Charm, Taunt or Intimidate you), and immune to the effects of being Crippled. Likewise, while you can't get a Hubris with it, it does give you a discount if you wish to purchase a Virtue. Needless to say, for a point based system, it is a very expensive advantage if a starting character wants it.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a>: Reloaded</em> and <em>Deadlands: The Classic Collection</em>, there is actually no known way to stop the Reckoners (though a later game, a side story to <em>Hell On Earth</em>, allowed you to fight them) and most of their servitors can only be killed in one, very specific way (eg: Jasper Stone, servitor of Death).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/NewWorldOfDarkness">New World of Darkness</a>:
<ul><li> The "Slasher" supplement brings us the Mask. Built for murder and only murder, these mindless killing machines can take a pistol magazine to put down (if you're <em>lucky</em>; any attack that hits it from any source, from a mere pistol shot to high-caliber weapons and even supernatural attacks, will only do <em>one</em> point of damage), and never need to sleep or eat.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/PrometheanTheCreated">Prometheans</a>. If these guys want something, they just WON'T. STOP. EVER. Sure, you can wound them and they will feel the pain. But they won't get knocked out. They will just keep walking towards you. If you take them down(say, with an artillery bombardment)? They WILL JUST COME BACK TO LIFE 24 hours later. Don't mess with the Created if you know what's good for you.
</li><li> To a simultaneously lesser and greater degree, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GeistTheSinEaters">the Bound</a> can soak a full health track of damage by spending <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mana">plasm</a> and, like Prometheans, aren't knocked out by anything short of a full track of the worst damage that can be dealt (though unlike Prometheans, they do still start to bleed out at the same point mortals do). They've got more natural <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">resurrections</a> than the Created do (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">albeit at a price</a>).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MummyTheCurse">The Arisen</a> have them all beaten. They're as durable as Prometheans, but have an active <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a> that they can pump up by various means. And unlike Prometheans and the Bound, resurrection is their <em>personal trick</em>. They cannot be put down permanently, at least, not by any method mortals can possibly hope to access. Even if you try something utterly insane, like tossing one into a black hole or the heart of a sun, it won't do it — they can just be called into a new body back on Earth and start everything all over again.
<ul><li> And the Deceived actually manage to take this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">one step </a><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">further</a></em>. It is, technically, possible for an Arisen of any other Guild to die and stay dead. If every remnant of their <em>sahu</em> is destroyed, they can only be reincarnated by someone doing the rituals to bring them back, which requires at the very least some knowledge of their existence. The Deceived, on the other hand, will be reincarnated by Fate itself if they are completely destroyed and nobody calls them back within the requisite timespan. Even wiping out the human race and destroying Earth itself would just cause the Deceived to start reincarnating elsewhere in the cosmos.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/VampireTheRequiem">Vampires</a> can do this to an extent. Under the original rules, they downgrade shooting attacks to Bashing damage and they can take care of that effortlessly with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">Healing Factor</a>, so a vampire without even a dot in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperToughness">Resilience</a> can wade through a firefight. After <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpdatedRerelease">Blood &amp; Smoke/2nd edition</a> was released, they began fitting this trope much more effectively. Basically, unless it's a Bane (sunlight, fire, etc) or does Aggravated damage in the first place, vampires take only Bashing damage from <em>everything</em>. You can shoot a vampire full of holes, then beat on them until your fists are broken, and they'll just keep coming.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WerewolfTheForsaken">Werewolves</a> can be added to the list starting with the second edition, though only when in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Gaurou</a> form. Why? Because that form now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">heals so fast</a> you just <em>cannot</em> hope to injure it longer than a few seconds unless you inflict Aggravated damages (which can only be accomplished by either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverBullet">silver weapons</a>, some rare high-level supernatural powers, or managing to inflict insane amounts of bashing or lethal damages <em>in a single turn</em>). Otherwise, you find yourself confronted with a constantly regenerating powerhouse <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">who will do everything to tear you apart</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RoleMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RoleMaster">Role Master</a> had the Dark Reaver, a black, indestructible suit of armour possessed by a demon. Usually set up as a guardian of a treasure, it would pursue thieves by simply walking after them, grabbing the stolen items and walking back with them. Any attempts at stopping them tended to be futile, since it was also carrying an indestructible axe (and knew how to use it). "You guys can have the rest — I call dibs on the black armour."
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> Zsofiska the Kite Flute, a demon that can be summoned to hunt down someone you want dead. Her movement speed? <em>Always</em> one foot per round faster than her target. Regardless of the target's movement speed. Also there is nowhere you can go that she can't follow. And demons are killing machines, even when fighting isn't their primary thing, so good luck fighting her off. And if you, upon summoning her, don't give her a target, she'll find <em>someone</em> to kill. Probably anyone who's standing close to you at any time. (So if you're an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OmnicidalManiac">Omnicidal Maniac</a> you may as well summon the demon and just walk around without giving her a specified target.)
</li><li> With the correct Charms, Green Sun Princes don't need to sleep, can eat virtually anything (or subsist on murder), and can outrun virtually anything, while being able to take megadamage hits clean on the chin without slowing down. Abyssals can channel the relentless inevitability of death. Lunars can be the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperPersistentPredator">Super-Persistent Predator</a>. Solars can follow you anywhere, overcome any concealment and open any lock. Dragon-Bloods aren't quite as powerful, but when they hunt you down they bring friends. Even Sidereals can get in on the fun with things like One Direction Invocation.
<ul><li> Lunars in particular get a charm that lets them do the same always-one-foot-faster thing that Zsofiska does. They're also the most durable Exalt type (and that's saying something) and have another charm that lets them <em>ignore the fact that they should be dead</em> for a while.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Generally speaking, in any system that allows them to achieve sufficient levels of toughness and badassery, suitably motivated <em>player characters</em> can easily become just this.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">YuGiOh</a> usually tends more towards the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvincibleMinorMinion">Invincible Minor Minion</a> side of things for indestructible monsters, but it has a few cards which definitely qualify:
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Beelze_of_the_Diabolic_Dragons">Beelze of the Diabolic Dragons<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a powerful Synchro monster. His effect prevents him from being destroyed by battle or by card effects. This includes all Spell and Trap Cards which destroy enemy monsters, the field-clearing powers of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlympusMons">Egyptian Gods</a> and other super-cards. If the opponent tries to overpower him by attacking with a stronger monster(good luck with that, his ATK and DEF are both 3000), he gains ATK power equal to the life point damage taken, meaning that he will quickly be able to destroy the enemy monster. There are a few ways of taking him down(getting control of him and using him for a Tribute Summon or using a card that removes him from the field without technically sending him to the Graveyard), but it requires some good draws and clever maneuvering to pull it off.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Vampire_Lord">Vampire Lord<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is a much less delinquent example. He can be destroyed by Spells, Traps, and Card Effects, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BackFromTheDead">he will Special Summon himself back to his controller's side of the field</a> during the Standby Phase unless he is destroyed as a result of battle with a stronger monster, although his stats are much more manageable than Beelze's.

With the DLC's included, they also have their brain, heart and spine removed and are actually better off for it (they have synthetic replacements installed), get stranded in a poisoned city filled with other unkillable monsters (see below), and simply walk away with all the guns and gold they can carry
</li><li> The Ghost People of <em>Dead Money</em>, after years of exposure to the toxic cloud, are nigh-immortal. They silently stalk you through the city, unable to talk through the heavy clothing they wear, dragging travelers off to beneath the city to do... God only knows what to them. After being left alone for 30 seconds, a 'killed' Ghost Person will simply start up again like a wind-up Terminator. The only way to stop them is the four Ds: Disintegration, Decapitation, Dismemberment, and Dog (who eats them). And in order to get into the Sierra Madre Casino, you have to start up the Gala event. Which attracts the attention of every single Ghost Person in the city, including the ones underground. Have fun.

If you take a key its guarding, it comes to life and chases you non-stop. It can't be killed (unless you grab a Starman) and the only way to shake it is to drop the key, although this is a temporary solution, because picking the key up again (and you'll always need it) causes the thing to resume the chase until you reach the key's door.

As such, they can be felled quite easily with a single jump, whereas physical attacks such as Mario's punches, hammers and shells cannot do shit to them. It's <em>still</em> only enough to take them down only temporarily: about 10 seconds after the fight and they'll get right back up and come after you again.

<ul><li> Tubba Blubba is completely unstoppable until you find his heart and make him mortal again. Mario and co. are aware of this, and immediately run for their lives in a chase sequence when he catches you in his castle. Attempting to attack him at this point is an unwinnable battle.

Worse still, pumping him full of bullets will only drop him to a knee stunned, giving you maybe half a minute at most to run away before he gets back up and resumes hunting. It takes a lot of bullets too, and they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmuneToFlinching">barely even stagger him</a>, so your best bet is to just run your fool ass off and hope you can ditch him.

No, wait, it gets better. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">That doesn't actually kill it. You just knock it out. Nemmy'll show up later.

In a cutscene, Leon and Helena kill one only to watch it pull itself back together effortlessly. While it seems they can be killed by separating their body parts and killing each part individually, after sometime the parts revive and the creature reassembles itself. However, most of the times you meet them are in areas where they spawn infinitely, which makes going through the trouble of killing them a pointless endeavor.

<ul><li> Big Daddy in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioShock1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioShock1">Rapture</a> and The Songbird in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioshockInfinite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BioshockInfinite">Columbia</a>. The former, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateRobotZombie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateRobotZombie">underwater cyborg steampunk Papa Wolf</a>, is a loose example as he won't attack you unless you provoke him. You might assume from his dense armor that Big Daddy can't keep up a hot pursuit. You would be mistaken. There are several models throughout the game, and two variations (one with a drill, and another with a rivet gun.)
</li><li> The Songbird, a giant robotic sparrow who patrols the tower <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingMacGuffin">Elizabeth</a> is imprisoned in. It's only goal is to return Elizabeth to her gilded cage, meaning it's possible to appease Songbird by simply handing her over. It takes the entire game to finally turn Songbird to scrap metal.
</li><li> And then there is the Motorized Patriot, who in his introductory video is actually described as being this, He feels no pain, he does not falter, no sense of self-preservation, he has no <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CranialProcessingUnit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CranialProcessingUnit">Cranial Processing Unit</a>, so really, you can shoot at him until he's dead but he will not stop.
</li></ul></li><li> The Black Knight/<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">General Zelgius</span> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> definitely qualifies. He's invincible to all but the main character's <em>BFS</em> (which you get in the last few chapters of the game...), at least in the first game. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">A whole castle falls on him, and he comes back just fine in the sequel.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HauntingGround" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HauntingGround">Haunting Ground</a></em>: The game's main claim to fame is that the player is chased by this type of individual once a chapter. These beings have different approaches to chasing the heroine, such as their attention span or diligence in finding her hiding spots. The best one can do before their boss fight is to run away, or knock them out via dog-mauling or alchemic munitions.
<ul><li> Debilitas (The Caretaker) serves as an introduction to the game's premise. He's not as durable or persistent as later stalkers can be, and can be knocked out somewhat more easily. That being said, he shouldn't be underestimated.
</li><li> Daniella (The Maid) is made of this trope; she is incredibly difficult to knock out, and when that's achieved, she gets up quite quickly. She will relentlessly stalk Fiona, pretend to not know where her hiding spots are and will purposely lock Hewie in rooms and attack him to draw Fiona out if she genuinely has no idea where she is. This is even lampshaded during her Boss Fight if she's knocked out:
</li></ul><div class="indent"> <strong>Fiona (in journal)</strong>: Even <em>that</em> didn't stop her?! What is she, the maid from hell?!

</li><li> Officer Carmelita Fox from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooper">Sly Cooper</a></em>. Wherever Sly is, Carmelita soon follows in hot pursuit.

<ul><li> The SA-X in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidFusion">Metroid Fusion</a></em>. Somewhat more complicated in that it's a copy of the heroine, with all the Metroid-killing equipment she wielded at the end of the last adventure. The real heroine starts off pitifully unpowered by comparison, and <em>is now part Metroid</em> to boot. Talk about stacking the odds against you. At first you can't do anything against it and just have to run away, but later on you can freeze it to slow it down.
</li><li> Samus herself is also an example. This is especially clear in the <em>Prime</em> series where you can read Space Pirate logs that speak of "The Hunter" as an unstoppable killer capable of obliterating their entire armies singlehandedly.
</li><li> The Metroids themselves, unless you're packing a cold based weapon.
</li><li> Dark Samus, a near unkillable doppelganger of Samus who thrives on Phazon and can come back <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromASingleCell">From a Single Cell</a>.

Then she returns in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroKiller">is more dangerous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster">than ever.</a>
</li></ul></li><li> After it is released in the third section of the PC game <em>Vivisector: Beast Inside</em>, the Overbrute Panther becomes an Implacable Man; while you can blast whole chunks out of it, it won't be slowed one iota by it, and will instantly regenerate, and unless you find some way of locking it out temporarily, it will <em>always</em> catch up with you and kill you with a casually-placed detonator to the chest. Oh, and it can turn invisible at will, as well, to both sight and radar, making it even harder to avoid the monster. Games designers are sadists, clearly.
</li><li> The first game with an Implacable Man was <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Berzerk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Berzerk">Berzerk</a></em> and Evil Otto, who shows up if you are slow in clearing the room of robots. Not only was he invulnerable, but could pass through the electrified walls that would kill anything else that touched them, including the robots that were also trying to kill the player. Otto would also destroy any robots that were in his way, and in some rooms the only way to get the bonus points for killing all the robots was to lead Otto through a walled off chamber in which the last robot was hiding. Otto would gradually speed up over time, and instantly go to maximum speed (twice as fast as the player) once all robots in a room were destroyed, making death at his hands unavoidable unless the player was very close to an exit.
<ul><li> In the sequel to Berzerk, Frenzy, Otto could actually be killed by four laser shots (either from players or robots). Every time he died, however, he would return from the same spot he spawned one second later, moving slightly faster than before. Killing him was worth quite a few points, but his movement pattern (bouncing vertically like a ball viewed from the side, even though the game actually used a top down perspective) made scoring hits very difficult unless directly above or below him, and this was the most dangerous place to be while fighting him due to the horizontal screen and the bouncing movement making Otto able to cover vertical distances much more quickly. It didn't help that missing Otto with a laser blast could result in the player's death from his own beam, due to new laser-reflecting walls present in the sequel. Finally, Frenzy included some special rooms, including the nightmare inducing "Mama Otto" room, dominated by a giant (but thankfully motionless) Evil Otto. Until you set it off...
</li></ul></li><li> A tradition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame">Fatal Frame</a></em> series thus far goes as this: Any hostile spirit that serves as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of the game is also unbeatable until the designated final battle against said ghost. This includes Kirie in I, Sae and the Kusabi in II, Reika in III, Sakuya in IV, and Ouse in V. (That said, Sakuya has a twist: You DO battle her weaker form early on and must defeat her to proceed, but then she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TurnsRed">Turns Red</a> and plays this trope straight.)
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace">Dead Space</a></em> has The Hunter, aka the Regenerator Necromorph, an artificial Necromorph created by the ship's resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> that steadily pursues you through the ship over several chapters. Notable for not only enduring all damage the player can inflict and brush off the effects of being cryogenically frozen, but after luring it into the path of a ship's thrusters and testing them, <em>it can still be seen trying to crawl towards you as it melts to death</em>.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace2">Dead Space 2</a></em> does this again through The Übermorph in the final chapters; whilst it is still relentless and able to regenerate limbs in moments, it is presented as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteMook">Elite Mook</a> by sudden unexplained appearance (and by it functioning primarily as an invincible mook rather than a plot device like the aforementioned Hunter).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DeadSpace3">Dead Space 3</a></em> ups the ante by throwing <em>several</em> Regenerators at Isaac in one level. He remarks that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemonicSpiders">REALLY hates those things</a>. They're put down for good when the docking bay vents and they wind up spaced (this doesn't kill Necromorphs, but a Necromorph floating in perfect vacuum isn't in a position to kill anyone).
</li></ul></li><li> Alma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FirstEncounterAssaultRecon">F.E.A.R.</a></em>. You actually do face her head-on at the end of the game... but even then, you don't so much defeat her, or hurt her, as vaguely annoy her into leaving you alone <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> by detonating a nuke on her head.</span>
<ul><li> It also appears to be <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">genetic. It does not matter <em>how</em> many clones, helicopters, or psychic phenomena you throw at the Point Man. He'll tear through it all without so much as grunting</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Jake and Francis Fratelli in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGoonies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheGoonies">The Goonies</a> (NES). The sequel introduces a third brother, but he can at least be defeated.
</li><li> Death's Hand from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire">Jade Empire</a></em>, who is also <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">The Dragon</a></em>.
</li><li> The G-man from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> is a variant: You don't fight him, but he does follow Gordon Freeman all over the place, finding routes through places that Gordon must fight through and getting to spots before Gordon can.
<ul><li> However, if you do feel like popping off a few rounds at him before he disappears round whatever corner, they simply bounce off with the bullets-on-metal sparks effect and sound (at least in the original; in HL2, like all important or allied NPCs, he simply cannot be hit by weapons).
</li><li> Gordon Freeman, the "Free Man" himself. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2">Half-Life 2</a></em> he is feared as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">One-Man Army</a> by the Combine, and worshipped as a hero by the humans in equal amounts.
</li></ul></li><li> All/most of the animatronics in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FiveNightsAtFreddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a></em> are this. In fact, the only thing that could stop most/all of them is getting scrapped/destroyed/burned alive. Honorable mentions go to:
<ul><li> Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, Golden Freddy and the Puppet try to kill the guard since 1983. They stopped it in 1993, only beacuse the restaurants closed down for 30 years.
<ul><li> Bonnie the Bunny. In 1987, he lost his face and arm, but he <em>still</em> tries to kill the guard.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mangle. It is a victim of <em><strong>gigantic</strong></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">Body Horror</a>, yet it still somehow walks. By 2023, the only thing found is it's mask, so you can imagine how much it took to finally stop it.
</li><li> The main four animatronics in <em>Sister Location</em> are extremely desperate to escape the establishment. They eventually merge their wires and endoskeletons to become Ennard. And how do they escape once they became Ennard? <em>Rip out our organs and skeleton only to replace it with themselves.</em>
<ul><li> They were stopped <em>decades</em> later by being burned alive.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DevilMayCry">Devil May Cry</a></em> series, enemies on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels">Dante</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Must Die and higher difficulties</a> have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Devil Trigger power</a> that they can use, making them nearly immune to flinching and much harder to kill. Vergil in the third title represents the Implacable Man ideal more accurately. When he uses his Devil Trigger (on <em>any</em> difficulty, BTW), he doesn't flinch from attacks, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NighInvulnerability">takes them without being scratched at all</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HealingFactor">regenerates health</a>. While he can be knocked out of it, showing the state to be merely a brief flirtation, it is hard enough to do so. When he assumes the Super/Desperation Devil Trigger in the final fight, he can't be knocked out of it, but he does halt after some time, though not before regenerating at a higher rate than in his normal Devil Trigger.
<ul><li> This is justified in that when <em>you</em> DT, you get the stun resistance yourself also, as well as the regenerative factor.
</li><li> Enemies? Dante gets impaled with his own sword in every installment. This somehow fazed him only the first time it happened. Must have been the novelty.

Just look at <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoOneCouldSurviveThat">what it takes to finally kill him</a>; it includes several battles against several elite warrior squadrons (plural) whaling on him, enough arrows stuck in him to build several houses with and one final duel with the opposite army's champion, and even then he goes down laughing because it took <em>that</em> much.
</li><li> An enemy/creature from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Pikmin">Pikmin</a></em>, the Waterwraith, is invincible unless you have purple Pikmin at your disposal. Unfortunately for you, you don't have any purple Pikmin when you enter the cave he dwells, and won't get access until you've reached the final floor.
</li><li> Liquid Snake from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a></em> survives a helicopter crash, an arseload of missiles that only succeed in blowing up his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> <strong>while he is inside the said mech</strong>, a forty foot fall from the top of yet again the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> after being punched off it during a fistfight, and then a barrage of gunfire to the face followed by a jeep crash.

While not entirely murderous, he seems obsessed with besting Snake after tasting humiliating defeat early in the story. However, he is hogtied by his own sense of honor, which forbids anyone else helping him (or Snake dying at anyone else's hands <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheOnlyOneAllowedToDefeatYou">but his own</a>).

Once he learns that World Marshall is planning to create an army of child soldiers using the same training regimen that was used on Raiden, he decides to take them down.

Oh, and Raiden can now slice open his foes and steal their nanotech to heal himself completely, making him even more difficult to stop.
</li><li> Kratos from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWar">God of War</a></em>. And when he does die, he just slaughters his way back to the land of the living.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGrimReaper">The Reaper</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em>, also known as "Death." It exhibits the "slow walk" by showing up whenever you take too long to advance to the next area. Even your support character warns you that you "can't defeat it!!", and tells you to get out immediately. It can be defeated it very high levels, but even if you do, it will still come back for more.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Scarface1983">Scarface (1983)</a></em> pseudo-sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ScarfaceTheWorldIsYours">The World Is Yours</a></em>, Tony can enter a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMode">Blind Rage</a>, where he exhibits true Implacability. He becomes immune to attacks, doesn't flinch, gains auto-aiming and the quasi-vampiric ability to heal by attacking enemies. Although it lasts for only brief periods, it can be reused and the meter needed to fuel it can be filled up fairly quickly. For that matter, Tony in general; he's gonna take Miami back and kill Sosa, and heaven help the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCussWord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeignCussWord">chazzers</a> stupid enough to get in his way.
<ul><li> Also in <em>The World Is Yours</em>, Big Bad Alejandro Sosa exhibits apparent-Implacability the way Tony did at the end of the film, taking whole clips to the chest without flinching. Even from the mighty <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandCannon">Desert Eagle</a> that instant-kills everyone else. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">A good few headshots</a> are needed to end him.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CommandAndConquer">Command &amp; Conquer</a></em>, Kane has survived being shot at by a giant space laser, and also being run through by a piece of debris.

</li><li> A little bit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">Fridge Logic</a> allows one to realise that almost all action game protagonists must appear this way to the hapless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks">Mooks</a> of the enemy — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">a lone man</a> — or sometimes more — who just keeps killing and killing his (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirl">or her</a>) way through whatever dregs of society and scum of the universe are thrown at him, no matter how <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantMook">big</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarSequence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarSequence">large in number</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorityEqualsAsskicking">high-ranking</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">well</a>-<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFS">armed</a> the opposition is, on his way to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainBall">idiot</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndYourLittleDogToo">pissed him off</a>.

<ul><li> Then again some do legitimately end up with so much HP they can outright ignore frightening levels of damage. Imagine what the human Mooks think of the human looking protagonists of most RPGs. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Metroid">Samus</a> or Link with all of their health upgrades are another example. Beam of radioactive plasma?
</li><li> This is lampshaded in Pratchett's novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyYouCanSaveMankind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/OnlyYouCanSaveMankind">Only You Can Save Mankind</a></em> where the Screewee Empire are genuinely fearful of the protagonist's ability to keep coming back every time they kill him, since they're a video-game antagonist race who are somehow real. When he points out it must surely be the same for them being as he's played one level many times and there's always three ships, they simply answer "different ships."
</li><li> Also lampshaded in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em> series. When one of your <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitPointWonder">One-Hit Point Wonder</a> characters comes back from the dead — either through using an extra life or using a continue — all enemy soldiers on-screen briefly <em>freak out</em> over their inexplicable resurrection.

Sending him to the distant past? <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSlowPath">Ha ha, yeah right</a>.

</li><li> The Lobstermen of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/XCom">X-COM</a>: Terror from the Deep</em>, like their predecessors the Chrysalids, will give this impression when you first encounter one. You fill it with harpoons, your squad opens fire with Gauss pistols, you launch torpedoes at it... and you watch in horror as it somehow survives it all and proceeds to mow down your troops.
</li><li> Humorously done by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">Allen O'Neil</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalSlug">Metal Slug</a></em>. In the second game he gets eaten by a killer whale upon defeat and <em>still</em> comes back for the sequels. When asked about his immortality, the game staff responded that the reason he never dies is because he both "has a body of steel and guts", and he has a wife and son to return to at the end of the day (a strange inversion of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFamilyPhoto">Fatal Family Photo</a> there).

Lampshaded by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Max Payne</em> and again by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> of <em>Max Payne 2</em>:

</li></ul></li><li> The Cyberdemon in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom">Doom</a></em> can mow through masses of lesser mooks with its rocket launcher and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHitKill">One Hit Kills</a> the player unless your health and armor are at nearly 200%.

It's so tough that <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/GamePro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/GamePro">Game Pro</a></em> simply put "shoot at it until it dies" as a tip, as some players back then seemed to think it was unkillable. The fact that you don't have the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFG</a> at that point doesn't help. Not to mention it had better stats (health, speed, pain chance) than the final boss, who shows up one whole episode later.
</li><li> This trope is completely flipped on its head in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom2016">DOOM (2016)</a>, wherein the game has sections where it makes it fundamentally clear that you, the Doom Slayer, are <em>by far</em> the most horrifying and unstoppable opponent that Hell has ever seen.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisasterDayOfCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisasterDayOfCrisis">Disaster: Day of Crisis</a></em>, Ray is practically this — he survives several natural disasters while fighting an elite former special forces unit, and he just still keeps coming after them on his own out of sheer willpower to save Lisa. Major Evans also has this trait, taking an ungodly amount of bullets to the face (and calls their first fight a <em>draw</em> after he takes so many bullets!), mans a Metal Gear expy while still taking even more bullets (or rockets) to the face, and can give Ray a hand-to-hand battle before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Colonel Haynes finally shoots him square in the forehead. That guy must have a really special gun.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RuneScape">RuneScape</a></em> had a couple of these guys that you saw that is implacable in general:
<ul><li> First one is Lucien in While Guthix Rests, an evil <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Mahjarrat</a>, during a cutscene where a series of heroes go and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">try to</span> fight the guy.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">.. well, needless to say most of them bit the dust for good and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledOffForReal">they DO NOT come back.</a></span>
</li><li> Second Nomination will be the Corporeal beast, a result of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero">Nice Job Breaking It, Hero!</a>. It comes to the corporeal realm to deliver a can of whoop ass for anyone willing to take a one way trip back to Lumbridge. Before it came to the corporeal realm, it was MERELY <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">trapped in the</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoulJar">Spirit Realm</a>, siphoning energy off the souls of a dead family for two quests. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> And then you show up. Naturally, living soul energy is much more potent than dead soul energy...</span>
</li><li> The final nomination will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent">Vampyres and Vyrewatch</a>, monsters that can't be beaten with even a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Godsword</a>, instead until you have a silver weapon, good luck fighting these guys. Even then, merely silver weapons will only work on Juvinates, the weakest form of the species; anything higher than that has limited mind reading and impossibly good reflexes, meaning any weapon with a predictable pattern (that is, all of them except a flail) can't even hit them to begin with.
</li><li> On the flip side, there's you, the PC. While quests generally act as if you don't die and do entire sections in one trip rather than individually (such as the finale of Dragon Slayer 2), you're known to be a warrior on par with the Wise Old Man and Robert the Strong, able to slay a Dragonkin's finest creation, which is so strong it can take out a Dragonkin itself in one blow<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note8owbj');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note8owbj" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note8owbj');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Robert the Strong is famous for being capable of killing Dragonkin <em>at all</em></span> and a corrupted fragment of a god, capable of getting around any obstructions regardless of what they are, and being one of the few characters capable of canonically surviving dying.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Tsukihime">Tsukihime</a></em> has a few of these as well.<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">From Arcueid being cut into 17 pieces and coming back to life the next day, Roa being taken down to nothing but his ankles and immediately regenerating, and Nero having his body ripped in two only to make fun of the person who did it. They have this trope covered.</span>
</li><li> The Ballistikraft robots from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RiseOfTheTriad">Rise of the Triad</a></em>. Invincible, hulking robots that roll towards you very slowly, shrugging off anything and everything you fire at it and spewing rockets at you. The only thing you can do is run.
</li><li> Definitely fitting the description on later difficulties is the Tank from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Left4Dead">Left 4 Dead</a></em>, which can survive magazines upon magazines of high-powered rifle and shotgun rounds and complete immolation for upwards of a minute. Combined with how hard he swings, he is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>.
<ul><li> The amount of his HP varies from 4500 to over 6000, depending on difficulty, with a wee bit over five goddamn thousand in the Versus mode. When in doubt, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire">Kill It with Fire</a>.
</li><li> Common Infected could occasionally become <em>absolutely immortal</em> thanks to a bug. Using a cheat engine that displays Infected health doesn't even give comforting high numbers (like 999,999), it reveals that they simply do not exist as far as the computer is concerned. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AIs">AIs</a> will simply give up and let the Implacable Zombie kill them, and the only way to survive is to shove it into a room, close the door, and rush through the rest of the level.
</li><li> Due to a bug in damage collision, it's entirely possible to hit a zombie with a melee weapon (almost always a one-hit kill on anything not a Charger, Witch or Tank) and see it's head get taken clean off, only to have the game register it as a miss. The zombie in question is perfectly killable if you can land a second swing, but until then it will come at you bleeding and without a head.
</li></ul></li><li> The Phantoms from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaPhantomHourglass">The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</a></em>, which cannot even be <em>stunned</em> until you get the bow about halfway through the game, and cannot be defeated until you get the necessary legendary sword shortly before the end of the game.
<ul><li> A benign example from the same series: the Postman, particularly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a>.</em> It doesn't matter where you go, what you do, or what lies between you — he <em>will</em> bring you your mail! Even if you pull off the glitch of making him fall into the abyss of Hyrule Field, he'll STILL bring you your mail.
</li><li> Then there's the Bublin King, who you have to fight four times. And in two of the fights he falls into a cliff upon defeat.
</li><li> Another Zelda example from <em>Twilight Princess</em> is the two Wallmasters in the Palace of Twilight. You can stun it with your Bow and Clawshot, but you can't kill it and it will KEEP COMING FOR YOU AS LONG AS YOU HOLD ITS SOL. Although, it'll give up after you go to the "outside" area and place the Sol in the ground.
</li><li> The cursed bokoblins in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></em> are described as returning from death by way of sheer hatred and will to mess up the world. And, supposedly due to a penchant for undergarments...
</li><li> A more traditional example in <em>Skyward Sword</em>: in the Silent Realm, there's two sorts of guardians; land based and flying. The land ones are faster and carry larger weapons, but they only pursue you when you're within a certain range. The flying ones, however, will <em>never stop hunting you.</em> They know where you are at all times and can phase through solid objects to hunt you down. They'll just keep following you until they eventually corner you.
</li></ul></li><li> Zouken Matou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight">Fate/stay night</a></em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He actually gets 'killed' so often and eventually so effectively by Kotomine that he moves his soul into the Crest Worm that was in Sakura's heart, at which points she rips it out. Then crushes it. And he's <em>still</em> not dead.</span> Also Kotomine, who had his <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> heart ripped out and was still around two days later to kick Shirou's ass despite the latter's body currently turning into swords</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JediAcademy">Jedi Academy</a></em> has four levels that involve different variations of the theme of an enemy (or several) chasing you that can't simply be killed, and three of the enemies fit this trope.
<ul><li> The sandworm will eat you in one bite if you stay on the sand long enough.
</li><li> The rancor. If you actually want to kill it, it's harder than many boss battles... and when you do kill it, another one replaces it. So you'll end up avoiding it anyway. Its powers of following you are less impressive, as it gets lost and can't fit under doors.
</li><li> Boba Fett. He's opposed to the idea of your finishing your mission, so he'll pit his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a> powers against your Jedi ones at every turn, only to fly away if you manage to damage him enough and return soon after returning to full strength.
</li><li> And finally, the mutated rancor. It's practically Godzilla, and it's completely immune to damage, so it's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJuggernaut">The Juggernaut</a> as well. Breathing poisonous gas and flailing at things, it will follow you all over the complex in the level, its steps making the floor quake, and demolish the scenery and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByHisOwnPetard">eat the badguys who released it</a> when it can't find you. When you find a way to sneak into the next hall through an exit it can't fit through, it will bang the wall until it yields and resume pursuit. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> At the end, you'll be able to kill it by crushing it on a conveyor belt between a giant crate and an energy field that only lets giant crates through.</span>

Another class (the tank furthermore) has a skill that does big damage in an area, but returns some to its caster. But a glitch can be exploited to make it HEAL you instead, thus doing huge damage to your foes while filling your own life gauge back up. In either case you get a nearly unstoppable character.

Part of the reason such <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheresNoKillLikeOverkill">overkill</a> is justified is because he's facing <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> an amnesiac Darth Revan, his former Master</span>.

According to the KOTOR Campaign Guide, Sion was once a living man, filled with so much hatred that when he finally was killed, his hatred and strength in the dark side allowed him to keep living, AND kill his assailant RIGHT THERE ON THE SPOT. He is bound together purely by his hatred. Oh, also, according to the medical records aboard the <em>Harbinger</em>, his flesh has been cut into a bunch of rotting chunks that now make up his body, and and each of his bones has been absolutely splintered and pieced back together.

Most characters, when they run out of health, go into "Fight For Your Life mode", where they slump to the ground and frantically try and gun down targets until they either bleed out or score a kill and earn a "second wind". Wilhelm's "Dreadnought" skill tree, however, has a skill called "Termination Protocols". With this, instead of a normal FFYL, Wilhelm gets a shorter period of full activity where he keeps walking and killing normally, plus electrifies the area around him — and if he fails to kill anyone in that time, he sets off a huge, if low-damage, explosion as a final "screw you" — and can score a Second Wind off any of these.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Warframe">Warframe</a></em> features the Stalker, a creepy-looking warrior in black carrying a decent scythe and one of the best bows of the game. He marks you for death everytime you kill a boss (killing more bosses, even for farming purposes, just adds more marks) and has a random chance to appear during almost any mission. He'll make himself known by flickering lights and taunting you over your comms, then lock you in your current room before teleporting inside. Either you kill him, either he kills you. No other alternative. And he can walk his talk, being able to tear apart players who aren't carrying high-quality gear. Think the mooks or your allies will stop him? He will just ignore or (if attacked) kill everything in the room if it means getting to you. And after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> you do the Second Dream quest</span>, he turns into the even stronger Shadow Stalker.

In Scholar's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> you can end up killing him nine times, more if you use bonfire ascetics. (That being said, part of this is a mistranslation from the original Japanese, in which the Pursuer is a member of an organisation of similar warriors, who are presumably the ones harassing you; in English, his boss soul's text implies he is a lone warrior with a particular grudge against those with the Undead Curse.)

</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius">Girl Genius</a></em>, perhaps only three words must be said: The Unstoppable Higgs.

Still pretty badass. The key point here is that when an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionSurvivor">Action Survivor</a> reaches Implacable Man levels he's going to require "Rum, lots of Rum" after it's all over.
</li><li> What did it take to stop him? That's a bit of a story. He got his arm broken by a delirious Captain DuPree, applied some first aid to the Emperor, and then got a leg broken by DuPree. She then gave him an infected bite, and destroyed the controls to the airship. He partially fixed the controls, and then set his arm, which caused him to pass out for a few moments. When he woke up, the airship was crashing into the lake. He pulled the Emperor and DuPree ashore (with one arm), when some monsters onshore broke his <em>other</em> arm. When he (somehow) got them both to the nearest town, the jumpy guards shot him in the <em>other</em> leg. Which finally managed to slow him down. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIron">Damn</a>. At a later point he was thrown into a wall by a robot. The one left damaged was <em>the wall</em>.

A rabbit Terminator with a built-in arsenal of guns. Survived a bazooka blast to the face from Bun-bun with only a lost nose. Was, however, distracted by having to hide Easter Eggs.
<ul><li> Bun-bun himself, though not invulnerable, fits this trope through the sheer power of badass.

<ul><li> Hilariously averted near the strips end, where the Dark Warriors are holding the four elemental orbs, threatening Sarda, who then points out that they have no idea how to use them. Bikke beans him with the Orb of Water, knocking him down, making Bikke the only one to really harm Sarda in the entire comic.

When Fuzzy at one point distracts Blank by throwing what he wants off the eight story of a building, Blank jumps after it without hesitation. When Fuzzy subsequently looks over the side and fails to find any body at the bottom, his companion's comment is "He's a blankface, it will take a bigger fall than that to kill him."

He's a snapping turtle the size of a dump truck, which by itself would be pretty damned implacable, but he just kept shrugging off wounds that should have been fatal. Smash a billboard over his head until the board is reduced to rubble, stopping his heart? It starts back up a moment later. Expose him to concentrated time rays that kill everything else almost instantly? It only makes him stronger. Drop an aircraft carrier on his head? He punches his way out. Spent a solid month engaged in a drinking contest? He sleeps it off in an hour or two. Retcon his entire world out of existence? He'll show up in the new one, bigger and angrier than ever. Shove a nuclear bomb in his mouth? He spits out the mushroom cloud, unharmed. It finally took an equally giant iguana stabbing him in the throat, followed by a demigod knocking his soul out with an I-beam to take him down; and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> said he would have eventually recovered from that if all the loose souls floating around hadn't been forcibly reincarnated.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SWATKats">SWAT Kats</a></em>, the Metallikats constantly shrug off most attacks on them. In their debut episode, they were particularly formidable, walking through gunfire and ignoring the Swat Kats' best attacks.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry">Tom and Jerry</a> short <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Mouse</em>, Jerry is turned into one of these by a concoction that Tom has force-fed him in an attempt to poison him; Tom tries slamming down on him with a phone book, hitting him repeatedly with a fire poker, shutting a door on him, and locking himself in a safe, all to no avail.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries">Batman: The Animated Series</a></em> has a good guy version of this with Batman in the episode, "The Underdwellers". First, one of the sewer kids tries to elude Batman through the tunnel system he knows like the back of his hand, only to find to his shock that The Batman is waiting for him. The Sewer King gets his own surprise in a quiet moment when he thinks that he has eluded Batman and locked the door behind him, only to suddenly have it blown open seconds later as he realizes that the Dark Knight is after him and <em>will not stop</em>.
</li><li> Elmyra from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures">Tiny Toon Adventures</a></em>. Nothing can stand between her and anything unfortunately cute enough to catch her attention. At one point, a sea monkey pulled a plug at the bottom of the ocean, which ended up draining <em>the entire universe</em> in order to get away from her. She still caught him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ice King places a hit on Finn and Jake intending the hit man, The Scorcher, to hit them, "like on the shoulder or something". Anyways he has trouble getting the Scorcher to stop hunting them down. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He does by tricking the scorcher into thinking Finn and Jake dead.</span>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurLichesAreDifferent">The Lich,</a> to everyone. Not only does he have determination, he's got the patience and brains to the point of actually invoking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItOnlyWorksOnce">It Only Works Once</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSnowQueen1995" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSnowQueen1995">The Snow Queen (1995)</a></em> and its sequel, the Snow Queen survives being frozen solid and being imprisoned in <em>lava</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack">Samurai Jack</a></em>:
<ul><li> In "Jack and the Hunters", there were the Imakandi, the greatest trackers and hunters in the galaxy. After Aku approaches them with the offer to hunt Jack, absolutely nothing the hero does can stop their pursuit or lose them for more than a few seconds. They chase him from a city's sewers to its very highest point until finally bringing him down; fortunately for Jack, they regard it as the greatest hunt of their lives, and as such, refuse to turn him over to Aku.
</li><li> In "Jack in Egypt" there were the Minions of Set, a trio of implacable demons. They attack swiftly, brutally and relentlessly. They do not tire and can heal from any injuries instantly. They do not stop to gloat; they do not give their victims a chance to gather their senses, power up, or otherwise prepare any kind of counter. They never stop attacking for an instant until their prey is either out of sight or dead. And even if you manage to get away, their super-senses will track you down before you even catch your breath. Jack ends up having to call upon the power of a <em>god</em> to defeat them.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTick">The Tick</a></em> had Blow-Hole, who was a weird variation. A giant whale with arms and legs dressed in overalls, his goal wasn't to hurt anyone (at least not on purpose, although he did a lot of collateral damage) but he <em>was</em> determined for some odd reason to jog from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific, and wasn't going to let anything stop him until he made it.
</li><li> Jasper from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>. Neither a spaceship crash, nor falling into a crevice, nor being punched past the horizon can keep her from coming after the heroes. She is generally shown to be one of the most durable single gems in the series, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeform" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateLifeform">later revealed to be an exceptional specimen even among her homeworld's soldier caste.</a> Arguably counts as both this and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Determinator">Determinator</a>.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RasputinTheMadMonk">Rasputin the Mad Monk</a>, whose... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer">well</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RasputinianDeath">Rasputinian Death</a> is something of a legend. To them it was assassination; to him it was an <em>induced nap</em>. See the film <em>Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny</em> if you want to see James Frain take about five minutes to kill <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanRickman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlanRickman">Alan Rickman</a>. Even better, see <em>Nicholas and Alexandra</em> where Rasputin is played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a>. Take care, however, in that Rasputin's...prolonged death is legend bordering on myth; the "real" story is a little more mundane, in that the poison he was supposedly dosed with didn't work not because he resisted it, but because <em>he barely ate anything</em> at the table, and so his somewhat incompetent assassins took him out back and shot him twice in the chest, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot">once in the head</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">third shot</a> being the killer, before dumping his body in the river, and reports of him apparently trying to claw his way out of the ice were actually accounts of his corpse floating under it for a moment due to the river's slow current not immediately washing it away. These days, his more well-known death were spread and perpetrated in by his political enemies in order to make him seem like a nigh-unkillable source of evil and corruption.
</li><li> Life itself. We've found anaerobic microbes inside volcanoes and sulfur springs and plants that live in the arctic. There will probably be rats and cockroaches after we blow ourselves up. Life finds a way. Flour beetles have it up on cockroaches. <em>Mythbusters</em> showed that they could take a dose of radiation for 30 seconds that was 100 times that which would kill a human. Ten percent survival rate.
</li><li> Robert Henry Cain. During the battle of Arnhem, he took to destroying tanks with gusto, hip firing a 2 man Piat gun and destroying several tanks until a charge blew in the barrel. He was severely wounded, but refused morphine and returned to the tank killing, and when he ran out of ammo for his Piat, he began using a 2 inch mortar instead. His eardrums burst from the constant explosions, yet he continued attacking tanks with a mortar at point blank range. He was awarded a Victoria Cross for his actions.

He lost his best friend in the battle of Zwolle, but he went on to liberate that town as well. And then also served in the Korean war and with his 20 man platoon captured a critical hill in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">a three day battle against 40,000 chinese soldiers!</a> There was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManArmy">one extremely ticked off man</a> with a sack of grenades and a jacket covered in machine guns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">routing the entire German garrison</a> (including the Gestapo members who escaped being shot down or blown up when he kicked down the door of their local headquarters, sprayed them with machine gun fire, and then tossed in some grenades for good measure). He was <em>supposed</em> to be scouting the German defenses so that the Canadian artillery knew where to shoot, but he and his partner (the one who got killed before he tap-danced on the garrison's faces) got ambitious and decided to capture the town themselves so that it didn't have to get pounded into rubble.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Humans in general</a>. We are one of the few species that can hunt prey by <strong>chasing it to death</strong>. It's a practice called <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting">Persistence Hunting<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Our two-legged gait is highly efficient compared to quadrupeds, and we have excellent heat-regulation systems (sweating), plus extremely dense muscles. To compare, an adult man weighs about as much as a jaguar. Women are, on average, about 5" shorter and much lighter than their brothers, but they still outweigh adult male wolves by about 40lbs.
</li><li> Humans under the effect of some substances, even more so.
<ul><li> The most common and notorious being alcohol: alcohol in sufficient amounts often renders people almost insensible to pain, so someone drunk may well ignore just how badly injured they are or that they are being beaten to a pulp or that they have otherwise sustained injuries too severe to be standing, much less fighting.
</li><li> Amphetamine-based stimulants in sufficient amounts can also induce aggression and a feeling of invincibility, with methamphetamine ("meth") and the synthetic cathinones ("bath salts"/"plant food") being the worst for doing this due to fast onset, relatively low dose needed for effect, and their being used in the most immediate delivery methods (snorting/smoking/injection). Cocaine, MDMA, less effective pill amphetamines (e.g. Ritalin/Adderall/Vyvanse), and even caffeine in high enough dosages can also have the effect. Combine any of these with alcohol's pain reduction, and it becomes even more so.
</li><li> PCP ("angel dust" or "wet") can invoke this at even very low doses because it provides both total insensibility to pain (it was originally used as a <em>veterinary anesthetic</em> for that reason) <em>and</em> aggression and a feeling of invincibility, and it also, unlike the above, can trigger hallucinations or delusions. The other dissociatives (DXM and ketamine) <em>can</em> possibly induce this, as they also eliminate pain, but they don't tend to cause <em>aggressive</em> behavior in and of themselves.
</li></ul></li><li> The A-10 Thunderbolt II, also known as the Warthog, is one plane that can take a licking and keep on ticking. A-10's have returned to base with damaged hydraulics, wings and engines to the point that the pilots have needed to land the aircraft using manual wire controls. A-10's have returned with wings, engine or even large sections of the fuselage blown away by enemy fire.
</li><li> The B-29 Super Fortress during WWII. It was the first mass produced pressurized aircraft, allowing it to fly thousands of feet above enemy aircraft. Even when it was forced to come in the range on non-pressurized aircraft (which it initially had to in order to bomb accurately), its thick armor allowed it to shrug off bullets. Lastly it had four remote controlled turrets that allowed their operators greatly improved aiming. It was so ridiculously hard to shoot down that bomber formations' "fighter escort" usually left the bombers to hunt ground targets of their own. As the name implies, the Superfortress succeeded the B-17 Flying Fortress, which had a similar record. Despite flying in daylight bombing raids, whereas the British flew their bombers by night, the USAAF actually lost less bomber crews than the British, flying in the woefully under-protected Lancaster.
</li><li> During <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, the Alpine part of the Italian front saw the Italian <em>Alpini</em> and the Austro-Hungarian Kaiserjäger assault each other's positions... On top of mountains, where the only available artillery were mortars and light cannons and the still infant military air forces couldn't support them. Even in the harsh winters, when they would build refuges by <em>digging them in the mountains or the glaciers</em>. And when they found a position too strong to be attacked, they'd just dig a gallery under it and place a bomb (this last tactic was abandoned by unspoken agreement when the final bomb, put together by the Austro-Hungarians, literally <em>collapsed half of a mountain</em>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">The Italians had prepared an even bigger one</a> but had been prevented from blowing it up when the Austro-Hungarian bomb was detonated a few hours before).
</li><li> Sharks. They evolved during the Ordovician Period, sometime between 455-425 million years ago. That means they've lived through all five of the Earth's mass extinctions, including the aptly named Great Dying, which saw 95% of all other marine life wiped out. In fact, they seem to have only gotten <em>more powerful;</em> the modern Greenland Shark has the longest lifespan of any known vertebrate, living for between 300-500 years. If there's one thing sharks should be known for, it's surviving.
</li><li> Whales, elephants, and other large animals are extremely durable. Elephants are an especially strong example. They are so tough that it's recommended that you shoot them directly <em>in the brain</em> with a gun strong enough to break your wrist or dislocate your shoulder if you are not careful.
