</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BloomIntoYou">Bloom Into You</a></em>, Touko Nanami initially seems like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAce">the perfect student and ideal student council president</a>, but it's revealed that when she was young, she wasn't very popular or good at school.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em>
<ul><li> Aisa Himegami's only power is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlessedWithSuck">attract vampires and kill them</a> when they try to drink her blood. She sometimes expresses a wish to have more useful abilities as she grew up admiring the heroes and wizards in stories and dreamed of becoming just like them. Unfortunately, she can't. Once an esper develops a power, they are stuck with it and can only improve that one ability. Espers also cannot use magic without nearly killing themselves in the process, even if said esper is a Level 0.
</li><li> It is mentioned that in the distant past, magic was developed by ordinary people who were jealous of espers, likely referring to gemstones, espers whose abilities were present from birth rather than engineered to have them like almost every esper in Academy City.
</li><li> Skill-Out is a gang of normals who were jealous of espers and were told they had no potential to develop an esper ability. Their most prominent member Shiage Hamazura jumps at the chance to learn magic when he hears about it and is disappointed when he's told he can't.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACertainScientificRailgun">A Certain Scientific Railgun</a></em>
<ul><li> Ruiko Saten. She moved to Academy City to develop psychic powers, only to be told she had no potential whatsoever. Despite years of hard work, she remains at Level 0, and is unable to assist Mikoto Misaka (Level 5) and Kuroko Shirai (Level 4) in fights. All of this eventually drives her to use the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrownNote">"Level Upper"</a> to develop powers. Indeed, this is the collective thought of all Level Upper users, which Professor Kiyama and Mikoto heard when the AIM Burst broadcasted it all after it came out.
</li><li> Kuroko correctly guesses that Misaka thinks that part of the blame for the Level Upper incident falls on espers, in part because they tend to rub their specialness in the normals' faces, and sometimes bullying happens. Misaka isn't one of these, but she tried to impart <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WisdomFromTheGutter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WisdomFromTheGutter">Wisdom from the Gutter</a>, which backfired spectacularly especially with her words "Levels don't matter", which rubbed Saten the wrong way as Mikoto's a Level 5 and Saten's a Level 0.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, Zenitsu's life as an underachiever who could never really make real friends, or ever be center of attention, left him with a burning that desire that for a person like himself only becoming someone special could make people truly like his company; special in Zenitsus case means becoming a demon hunter who can defeat any nemesis and be loved by people everywhere he goes, this desire of his clashes directly with how much of a negative person he is towards himself, while deep down Zenitsu wants to reach greater heights, on the surface he thinks of himself as someone who will just die at every demon encounter thus having any aspirations would be a waste.

None of them were evil, they were just sad, lonely and lacking in confidence, something which Oikawa takes advantage of. He promises them that if they let him embed the dark seed in their necks, then they'd become smarter and more talented, like the original host of the dark seed, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAtoner">Ken</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce">Ichijoji</a>. None of them realised that the seed could turn you evil/insane, and Ken ends up in tears, saying to them that they don't want to end up like him. They only listen later, when it all goes to crap.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em>, Videl. This trope is the main reason she trains so hard because she wants to be as powerful as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero">father</a> who supposedly defeated Cell and was already strong enough to be asked for help from the police. When she discovers Gohan's secret identity, she stalks him until he teaches her how to fly (with Goten who by the way surpassed her in a hilarious way) and use her chi like the Z Fighters. After this, she became the third most powerful woman in the series (after Chi-Chi).
<ul><li> This also applies to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">Vegeta</a>. While already one of the most powerful fighters he has repeatedly fallen on this. For example, in the Frieza saga, he wanted to be the legendary Super Saiyan, in the Cell saga he wanted to be the best and became Super Vegeta, and in the Majin Buu saga, he became Majin Vegeta thanks to this desire. And in true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticIrony">Dramatic Irony</a>, he gives up and accepts that Goku is better than him.
</li></ul></li><li> Mikado from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> moves to Ikebukuro for the express reason of making his normal life become interesting. When he meets a mythical headless being and simultaneously discovers there's a laboratory conducting evil experiments, he does everything he can to become involved. However, he is an interesting subversion of I Just Want To Be Special, because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">all this time he has been hiding his identity - he is the leader of Dollars</span>.
<ul><li> Also, in Izaya's backstory, it's revealed that he thinks that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Shinra</span> wants to be special and that he's willing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingtheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingtheBullet">take a knife wound</a> for Izaya in order to do it. Naturally, this one event affects Izaya than he lets on to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Shinra is the only person he actually cares about.</a></span>
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FLCL">FLCL</a></em>, the main character opens and closes the series with a complaint about how boring and normal his life is (the events in between these complaints notwithstanding). Though he treats most of the crazy and exciting things that happen in the show as more of an annoyance than an adventure.
</li><li> Mayo Sakaki, from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FushigiYuugi">Fushigi Yuugi</a> Eikoden</em> OVA, is a deconstruction of this. All she wants is to be powerful and, more than that, to be Tamahome's true love. And she is willing to become an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseMaiden">Apocalypse Maiden</a> and very nearly destroy Tamahome's world (both literally and figuratively) to do it.
</li><li> Done darkly in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostHunt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GhostHunt">Ghost Hunt</a></em> - one character's desire for people to notice them winds up creating a poltergeist and injuring several characters.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GonnaBeTheTwinTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/GonnaBeTheTwinTail">Gonna Be the Twin-Tail!!</a></em>, Souji's mother says she and his father both grew up dreaming of becoming a superhero and saving people with cool powers.

However, when he attempts to rescue his former best friend from a creature that he and All Might encountered earlier, All Might not only saves him but gives him the chance to be a hero. As he put it, true heroes were those who go in and willing to help as an instinct; All Might reveals his Quirk is transferable and chooses him as the next wielder because of his worthiness. It's a fascinating play on the trope as well. Izuku becomes special not because of the uniqueness of the Quirk, but because of his determination made him worthy to become one.

His younger brother was sickened by this exploitation, especially since he recognized his brother's underlying sociopathy. In an attempt to get him to fall in line, he gave his brother a power-stocking Quirk... which combined with his brother's dormant Quirk of being transferable and thus forming One For All and beginning the long conflict between its wielders and All For One, up to All Might defeating All For One... yet it's implied the latter is planning to <em>pass</em> the Quirk-stealing Quirk to <em>his</em> protege, who is already shaping to be the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchEnemy">Arch-Enemy</a> of Izuku.</span>

Luckily for her, it worked and she became the electric superheroine Sparx.
</li><li> The "Dead Robin" arc of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GothamCentral">Gotham Central</a></em> revolves around the murder of several teenage boys who are dressed in Robin costumes. After the police and Batman <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotMeThisTime">eliminate the usual villains as suspects</a>, the real perpetrator (A reporter) comes forward. However, he demands to be allowed to confess directly to Batman, and he explains that he just wanted to be a part of that world.

This is a guy who became suicidally depressed at the mere sight of Superman, that's how severe his envy was. What's worse? He soon discovered that even with powers, he was no Superman and that there wasn't any point; his entire storyline is told through his call to a suicide hotline.

</li><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InsaneJane" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InsaneJane">Insane Jane</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jane does drugs and exposes herself to dangerous chemicals under the delusion that that sort of thing actually gives you superpowers as it does in the comics she reads. She even <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">murders everyone she knows in an attempt to invoke <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByOriginStory">Death by Origin Story</a></span>.

Well, that and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jane is schizophrenic and didn't know she was killing those people. Barbara knew <em>exactly</em> what she was doing.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> This is part of the reason for the superhero movement in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/KickAss">Kick-Ass</a></em>. In Volume Two, Kick-Ass meets Dr. Gravity, who claims to be a genius physicist wielding a device that can increase or decrease the weight of an object. Kick-Ass expresses disbelief, and Dr. Gravity comes clean - he's an English major at a local university and the gravity rod is a baseball bat covered in tin foil. He isn't ashamed, though. As far as he's concerned, being a superhero is primarily about living your fantasy life.
</li><li> "I Just Want to Be Special" practically defines <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor">Lex Luthor</a>'s character. He resents and envies people with superpowers in general and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> in particular, both for their powers and for receiving the respect and adulation that he believes he's entitled to as a one-in-a-million 12th level intellect genius. Everything he tries to make himself more special than them never works. Being a brilliant inventor and businessman? Didn't work. Trying to kill them? Didn't work. Masquerading as his own son through cloning and starting his own super team? Didn't work. Becoming President? Didn't work. This reached a head in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FiftyTwo">52</a></em> when he started his "Everyman" Program that offered exo-gene treatments to other people who also wanted to be Special. Though his initial goal seemed to be building a superhuman army that he could control (while making real superheroes seem less special in general), <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousBreakdown">Lex gets increasingly frustrated</a> when repeated testing confirms that he is incompatible with his own treatment.

He <em>does</em> succeed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedFanboy">in becoming the sidekick of a Superman expy</a>, but that is when he simply acts with everyday heroism and helps the hero, instead of trying foolish stunts to gain glory. The hero points out that he is a potential <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal">Badass Normal</a>, but ignored it dreaming of superpowers.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU">The DCU</a>, Houston was the only member of the team <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RelativeHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RelativeHeroes">Relative Heroes</a></em> who did not have superpowers and was the one most desperate to be a traditional superhero.
</li><li> An issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RisingStars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RisingStars">Rising Stars</a></em> was dedicated to a young man who, in a bid for attention, claimed he was one of the "Specials" (113 kids who were in-utero when a giant energy shockwave hit their small midwest town, imbuing them with superpowers as they got older). However, since all the other Specials could "feel" one another, they knew he wasn't one, and encouraged him to recant his tale.
<ul><li> This was touchingly subverted when he gave his life saving a girl he liked from an oncoming, out-of-control truck. All the Specials went to his funeral and consider him one of their own.
</li></ul></li><li> "Dodge" from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries">Robin</a></em> stole a prototype personal teleportation device from his Star Labs scientist father because he wanted to be a hero. After his arrogance and lack of training get him injured when he endangers a group of hostages and the device malfunctions and starts to fuse with him he decides to turn villain instead. Evidently, super-hero to super-villain is not a big jump for Dodge as long as he gets to be some type of super.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SevenSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SevenSoldiers">Seven Soldiers</a>: The Bulleteer</em>, Alix eventually calls out Mind Grabber Man (a kid who had an adventure with the Justice League and has been trying to recapture that glory ever since) for this attitude. "Why's everyone so obsessed with being special?" This cuts him <em>deep</em>.
<ul><li> This is also Alix's own origin; her husband Lance Just Wanted To Be Special (and ironically was involved with Sally Sonic, who Just Wanted To Be Normal) and developed a supersteel smartskin that killed him and was accidentally transferred to her.
</li><li> It's also mentioned that there are entire wings in many hospitals devoted to the people who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ILoveNuclearPower">expose themselves to radiation</a>, etc. in the desperate hope of gaining powers.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ShamansTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ShamansTears">Shaman's Tears</a></em>, Thom Broadarrow is intensively jealous of Joshua Brand and thinks the powers of Wakan Tanka should have been his. He eventually becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RivalTurnedEvil">Rival Turned Evil</a> towards Joshua.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk">She-Hulk</a> was one of the few who benefited from gamma radiation, and it only took a while to <em>love</em> her new form, which served as a sort of release from the far more inhibited Jennifer. She's rarely even wanted to turn back to human form at all over the years.
<ul><li> In fact, it was her want of this that allowed her to become She-Hulk in the first place. She is a gamma-mutate, a rare type of person with a genetic quirk that makes her a Hulk when exposed to gamma radiation, with said form being a reflection of their innermost emotions. Her desire to be confident, special, sexy and unique is why She-Hulk is the way she is. (Essentially, an Id gone wild; Bruce Banner became The Hulk we know him as due to massive amounts of repressed anger since childhood; when we see Bruce and his father's final encounter, resulting in Brian Banner's death, we see that the Hulk was within Bruce before the accident.)
</li></ul></li><li> Although Andy Maguire from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan">Spider-Man</a></em> seemed to have no ambition to be anything beyond an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyAverageGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyAverageGuy">extremely average nobody</a>, we learned otherwise when he gained superpowers from a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakLabAccident">Freak Lab Accident</a> ala Peter's and later faced the prospect of losing them. This was hinted at a bit earlier when he shows secret envy and resentment towards a jock who managed to get with his school's most popular girl despite being there for only two weeks. Predictably, he was devastated when Spider-Man removed almost all his powers due to Andy being reckless with them one time too many, and so now he's back to being a nobody— and worse, a laughingstock/has-been.
<ul><li> Then he regains his powers along with even better senses. While he tries being a more responsible hero, he ends up being blackmailed by a crime boss to look the other way for his crimes (and one of his attempts resulting in creating an archenemy.)
</li><li> Its spin-off series, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SpiderGwen">Spider-Gwen</a></em>, has Peter Parker telling this to Gwen before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiedInYourArmsTonight">dying in her arms.</a>

When they reconcile months later, Sarai confesses her reasons for abandoning her friend:

He becomes bound and determined after Shifu's pep talk to train and be a true master, then seems to give up when the Scroll seemingly does nothing, though this was more Shifu sending everyone away to try and deal with Tai Lung alone. However, we then learn the meaning of the blank reflective scroll; there is no secret. Believing in yourself being special makes you it. And with this insight, Po goes to defeat Tai Lung, who tragically could not understand the meaning of the scroll due to his upbringing. The surprisingly realistic moral of the story seems to be that while many say they would love the chance to answer the call when it finally comes they may find out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeCarefulWhatYouWishFor">it's not all it cracked up to be</a>, and things are neither as fun or easy as they expected.

</li><li> Tash Arranda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GalaxyOfFear">Galaxy of Fear</a></em> is not actually normal. She's Force-Sensitive, though it takes a while for her to realize it. Well before that, she idolizes the extinct Jedi Knights, wishing she could be like them, and even after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/GalaxyOfFear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/GalaxyOfFear">touching the Force</a> she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDoIShotWeb">has no idea what to do</a>. Throughout the series she longs to better use the Force, and never has real control over it — it comes and goes.
<ul><li> In <em>Clones</em> she's progressed to the point where she can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindOverMatter">make a small crystal move</a>.

She's trained in swordplay like a cavalier, and is desperate to test her skills, but has to maintain the facade that she's the necromantic heir to the House. When Ianthe kills Naberius and consumes his soul to become a Lyctor, Corona is <em>distraught</em>not because of Naberius's death, but because Ianthe picked <em>him</em> over <em>her</em>.</span>
</li><li> This is a bit of a recurring issue in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> series.
<ul><li> When we see Voldemort's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StartOfDarkness">Start of Darkness</a>, we find that as a child he hated everything he considered "common" about himself (especially his name "Tom"). Ultimately, wanting to be special was what motivated everything he did, since even after finding out he was a wizard he wasn't satisfied since he wanted to be "special" by <em>their</em> standards as well.
</li><li> Harry Potter's Aunt Petunia is guilty of this too, as she wanted to go to Hogwarts, but she is just a muggle with no magic. Or rather (since you don't apply to Hogwarts in the first place), she was jealous of Lily being the one who got powers, and thus got invited to the school for people with powers, and got to be special and get all sorts of attention for being special, et cetera and so forth until Petunia resented everyone in her life for not paying enough attention to her, and most especially her sister for robbing her of that attention. This explains why she ended up marrying Vernon; if ever there was a guy more antithetical to magic and all the things that her sister represented, history never recorded him.
</li><li> Filch, the caretaker of Hogwarts, is known to envy people with magical powers to the point that he has signed up for a correspondence course to learn magic. Too bad for him he doesn't have any.
</li><li> This is one of the more prominent character traits for Ron Weasley, Harry's best friend. In fact, when looking at the Mirror of Erised, which reveals one's deepest desire, Ron sees himself as being more successful and victorious than any of his siblings. This desire stems from being the sixth son of the Weasley family, which gives Ron the feeling he has a lot to live up to, but if he does, its not special, since his older brothers already did so before him (and they indeed have done a lot, making it difficult to stand out.) Furthermore, his only younger sibling, their sister Ginny, already achieved their mother's dream of wanting a daughter, which leaves him feeling left out. Wanting more than anything to stand out becomes difficult when one ends up best friends with the savior of the Wizarding world and one of the smartest people alive. Ironically, he also tends to be pretty humble if not shy about his own successes, feeling they were just accidents. He overcomes this over time, especially by Book 7, though one notes that he has never really discussed this problem with Harry nor Hermione. In a moment of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetAndSourGrapes">Sweet and Sour Grapes</a> though, he <em>does</em> achieve his dream of being more accomplished than his siblings, having been a Prefect, led the Gryffindor team to victory in Quidditch (with Harry being absent no less!) and would even get a Chocolate Frog card, something none of his family can claim. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SincerityMode">Good job, Ron.</a>
</li><li> This trope is also the reason behind Draco's actions and his entire antipathy towards the main trio in the first place. Draco is from an obscenely wealthy family that prides themselves on good breeding, and he's been taught that wizards with lesser breeding aren't even worthy of being wizards and are to be shunned. He's then sent to school and confronted with a half-blood who's heralded as the savior of the Wizarding world, a genius-level Muggleborn who sweeps the floor with him in raw magical talent, and a pure-blood from a dirt-poor family (yes, they may be looked down upon by the rest of the pure-bloods, but are still respected overall) that's ultimately more loving than his own and who value bravery and kindness over raw ambition, opposite to the Malfoys. His major actions in the series are even juxtaposed to Harry's in an attempt to be as special as him on the opposite end of the spectrum. As the series progresses, Draco's attempts at seeking relevance and validation equal to Harry get more extreme <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">until the stress and threats to his life make him realize how little it's really worth and how much he overestimated the glory of being special and underestimated the responsibility</span>.
</li><li> Severus Snape had this as his defining motivation. A half-blood raised by an abusive father and uncaring mother, he sought to make himself well-known to the wizardry robe and show them all with how clever he is. This would lead him to <em>despise</em> James Potter, envying James for having a loving home life while being talented at sports <em>and</em> magic while being good-looking and popular. This resentment was mutual since James seems to hate Snape because of his fascination in dark magic as well as being friends with Lily, the girl they both liked though it's unknown how James really felt since he is deceased by the start of the book and most of the moments seen are those from his friends or Snape. They hated one another's existence and this escalated when they would hex or attack one another (such as James using one of Snape's own spells against him and humiliating him.)

After being put through traumas that include losing his hair as a child, being bullied at school, taking the blame for his mother murdering his infant brother, having his mother commit suicide and dealing with his emotionally abusive father, Lex desperately needed to believe that it was all for a higher purpose as the alternative (That it was all for nothing) is far too horrible to contemplate. This goes to explain his resentment of Clark who constantly rejects his amazing power and doesn't want to fulfill the destiny Lex believes he is entitled to.

They're prized by mages as companions (or pets), but because arrogance and hubris are part and parcel of Awakened life, most of them fall into this trope — after all, they're stuck watching their magical, wonderful friend go out and do magical, wonderful things, knowing that not only are they being forced to watch on the sidelines, but that their magical, wonderful friend <em>only</em> wants to hang out with them because they can be magical and wonderful around them.

<ul><li> To make things worse, there are even magical conditions that prey on this aspect of Sleepwalkers.

After <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> saving the day by delivering Agent P's escape tools to him and using packing tape to stop Dr. Doofenshmirtz's Juice-inator</span>, he decides that he is special enough but now calls himself a "mobile logistics technician".
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em>: Princess Morbucks' debut episode "Stuck Up, Up And Away" has her wanting to be a Powerpuff Girl herself, but not because she wants to do good for the common masses. She thinks it's a status symbol. After a smackdown Princess eventually loses, Blossom unmercifully lays the ground rules of being a Powerpuff.
<ul><li> In 'Nuthin' Special," Buttercup is put out because she didn't have a special power to aid in assisting a giant flaming squirrel (who just wanted to have his fire put out). Throughout the episode, she tries to unleash a special power, only for Blossom and Bubbles to duplicate it. She acquiesces at the end and in defiance, she sticks out her tongue, curling it in the process. To Buttercup's delight and everyone else's bewilderment (especially the narrator's), nobody else can curl <em>their</em> tongue.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls2016">2016 version</a> has the episode "Blundercup" which involved a boy that wanted to be a superhero. He got his wish when he got in a accident with a nucular fryer and became a being made of butter. But found a lot of downsides to it (dogs chasing him, ridiculed and chased by mobs for some reason) that he hated the power. So his solution... was to steal Buttercup's body (apparently one power he <em>did</em> get was the power to body swap) and use that to be a proper superhero. When Buttercup confronts him to reclaim her body, she shows that she went out of her way to learn how to utilize the butter power properly that she's able to beat the boy in a fight and chides him for not even <em>trying</em> to find the upsides to use them and being unable to think outside the box like a real superhero would.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder19');">     Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder19" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> This is a common desire in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> (especially in little kids), frequently resulting in the creation of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapistCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscapistCharacter">Escapist Characters</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanFiction">Fan Fiction</a>. At its most extreme this can result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue">Mary Sue</a>, where the character is nothing <em>but</em> a list of traits the author wants to have, with no real personality.
<ul><li> A related phenomenon is the Japanese slang term <a class="urllink" href="http://en.dic.pixiv.net/a/Chuunibyou">chuunibyou.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity">Transhumanism</a>.
</li><li> A large part of what makes conspiracy theories so attractive is that they allow their believers to live in a world where nearly everyone else is either soullessly evil or mindlessly stupid, meaning that all they have to do to be better than the rest of humanity is to get out of bed.
</li><li> Maria Cristerna, the "Mexican Vampire Woman", claimed this is the reason for her <em>very</em> extreme body art, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z127wKKWfXg">as she herself explains.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> Also the reason virally-infectious creatures like Vampires and Werewolves are still topical and marketable despite being one of the oldest persisting myths in the world. In fact, it's been observed that media where Vamps/Weres can't change normal people leads to poorer sales than the media where they can.
<ul><li> Note that this goes both ways. In works unsympathetic to werewolves or vampires, a viral infection method allows the users to feel special for being aware of the problem/ not infected. Which is (probably) a given. On the other hand, in works where these monsters are portrayed sympathetically, having them be able to spread the condition makes them more interesting. This allows the reader to imagine they are a bite away from being a powerful minority.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a> stories also garner a <em>lot</em> of popularity from this aspect, since the stories tend to star everyday people in everyday locations just trying to stay alive with nothing but their wits, a little luck, and whatever weapons they can get their hands on. You, me, or anyone out there could be that <em>special</em> man or woman who managed to survive the Zombie Apocalypse, all by their lonesome <em>or</em> with their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">True Companions</a>, just like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheWalkingDead">Rick Grimes</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwentyEightDaysLater">Jim</a>, or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DawnOfTheDead1978">Francine</a>.
<ul><li> A Simpsons episode (focusing on survivalists in general rather than just zombies) actually lampshaded this ideology, with Superintendent Chalmers (one of the preppers) noting that he was disappointed since he thought it was his opportunity to be a big shot.
</li></ul></li><li> A dark take on this similar to the Crime Master in the Comicbook folder does occur in real life. One of the earliest examples was Herostratus, the man who burned down the Temple of Artemis solely because he wanted to be remembered. To some people, infamy is just as good as fame.
</li><li> President Lyndon B Johnson alludes to this trope as not just a primary reason behind racism, but also how certain organizations and groups exploit it for their own benefit while keeping the majority divided:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Lyndon B. Johnson:</strong> If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you."
</div></li><li> Narcissists are far more likely to be bigots and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomerangBigots">Boomerang Bigots</a>. The latter allows people to feel not only superiority, but accomplishment by "rising above the flaws inherent to their kind."
</li><li> This phenomenon underlies what Freud called <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissism_of_small_differences">the narcissism of small differences<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The more similar people are, the more they will exaggerate their minor (or even completely imagined) differences in order to maintain the distinction between self and other.
