<div class="indent">— <strong>Sheldon Cooper</strong>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory">The Big Bang Theory</a></em>
</div></div><p>Photographic Memory, technically called eidetic memory, is the ability to recall images, sounds or objects in memory with near perfect accuracy and in abundant volume.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>True eidetic memory is not simply "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperIntelligence">exceptional memory for details</a>", but involves memory which actually works in a way vastly different from normal memory, specifically, the ability to "capture" an image after a short exposure, such that the eideticer has the subjective experience of actually still seeing it even after it has been removed. Someone with a good memory can notice details about something they see, and then recall those details months later. Someone with an eidetic memory can look at something, remember it later, and, when remembering it, <em>notice details they completely missed the first time.</em>
</p><p>While many people can claim to possess an extraordinary memory, most researchers believe that it is unlikely that true eidetic memory exists in adults, and most cases of "real life" photographic memories are either the result of intense training and devotion, such as among composers, or abnormalities of the brain. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky">Solomon Shereshevsky<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and Kim Peek, the inspiration for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RainMan">Rain Man</a></em> are some of the closest real life examples of this ability. A more contemporary example is <a class="urllink" href="http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/17-04/ff_perfectmemory">Jill Price<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> who has almost perfect recall of events that have happened during her life.

In this sense, their memory is closer to <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymesia">hyperthymesia<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> than eidetic memory.

<ul><li> Ichikawa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akagi">Akagi</a></em> has trained himself to this as regards to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mahjong">Mahjong</a>, and is able to recall perfectly every single draw and play done during any particular round.

</li><li> Armitage's daughter Yoko from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmitageIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ArmitageIII">Armitage III</a></em>.
</li><li> The main character Ryouta from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BrynhildrInTheDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BrynhildrInTheDarkness">Brynhildr in the Darkness</a></em> can remember anything he has seen and makes him very observant, which has helped many times. It even appears to be the reason he was not affected by a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia">Laser-Guided Amnesia</a> attack</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaheDetectiveClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CaheDetectiveClub">Cahe Detective Club</a></em>: Emina can do this along with sharp senses. At busy times in the cafe she can accurately take orders from a dozen people speaking at the same time. And she always gets perfect scores on exams from memorizing entire textbooks and she also reads fast. As demonstration of her ability, she can keep track of a deck of cards getting cut and all the underwear Nana was wearing since they started the club.
</li><li> Aoi, the oldest of the Sakurada siblings in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion">Castle Town Dandelion</a></em>, has this as her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyaltySuperpower">Royalty Superpower</a>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Except not really.</a> Her <em>actual</em> power is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompellingVoice">Compelling Voice</a>, but seeing as she's such a humble <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGirl">Nice Girl</a>, she absolutely refuses to use it, and keeps it a secret from almost everyone because she's scared of what they might think.</span>
</li><li> Tokura Misaki from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CardfightVanguard">Cardfight!! Vanguard</a></em>. It's not a pretty situation for her because it comes packaged with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">PTSD from witnessing her parents' car crash.</span> The memory does prove useful in cardfights, where it helps her memorize and predict the content of her opponent's deck.
</li><li> The titular Index from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ACertainMagicalIndex">A Certain Magical Index</a></em> has photographic memory. It was used to remember a library worth of magic books. The side effect was the danger of Index's brain overflowing from too much memories, mandating wiping her memories every year. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Said danger was in fact a lie to prevent her from rebelling - someone with a library worth of magic books is extremely dangerous.</span>
<ul><li> Accelerator also has this, but only for what he sees. He memorizes a massive page of computer code by looking at it once, destroys it, and comments it was easy. He has forgotten his real name from not using it for a really long time, and he needed help to remember the lyrics for Index's song.
</li><li> According to Aureolus Izzard, vampires all have photographic memory.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CreoTheCrimsonCrises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CreoTheCrimsonCrises">Creo the Crimson Crises</a></em>, we have Creo who aces a physics quiz by flipping through the physics textbook and memorizing it a few minutes before the quiz.
</li><li> Lavi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>, as expected from a future <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueNeutral">Bookman</a>, has a photographic memory. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He's able to find one particular key amongst thousands of its illusions, because 'The scratches, the dirt, all the patterns of the plating of the real key were recorded in his head ever since he first saw it.'</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em>:
<ul><li> According to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongRunner">eighth movie</a>, not only does Conan remember everything in crystal detail, but he can even rewind the last twenty-or-so minutes of film to let his eidetic memory take over in order to solve the murder. So he's got... what, a <em>cinematographic</em> memory?
</li><li> Heiji has shown himself to have an eidetic memory, capable of remembering complex letter and number sequences at only a glance, such as when he was able to solve a code in his head during the "Heiji and Kazuha in Grave Danger" arc, and even reproduce another message using the same code to text to Conan.
</li><li> Shuikichi Haneda is extremely skillful at memorizing, as shown when he managed to remember the code written on Sakurako's paper despite having only seen it for a very short amount of time. He also claims to be the best in this field.
</li></ul></li><li> Minami Megumi aka Megu from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveSchoolQ">Detective School Q</a></em> uses her photographic memory to aid her in solving mysteries.
<ul><li> Also, one of the victims of the day was a famous artist who had a similar ability. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> He also was Shino Katagiri's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnluckyChildhoodFriend">Unlucky Childhood Friend</a>, and as he lay dying he left some clues about the identity of his killer. Megu is the one who puts two and two together and, with Kyu's help, solves the case.</span>
</li><li> Cerberus, a high-ranking member of Pluto, claims to one of prisoner guards keep watching on his cell he can re-read books without the book itself (he was blindfolded during this scene and he recites a quote from "Count of Monte Cristo" perfectly word by word) like a library, suggesting this ability. While said exchange and him reciting the quote is actually a preparation for his prison break, the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he used to be in National Talent Development Research Institute</span>, a fact revealed much later, still supports this trope <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as Megu was also a student there too</span>.
</li><li> Asaba Fuko, Megu's best friend during her days in National Talent Development Research Institute, claims she can remember any complicated musical scores in one read. No further elaboration is made but it's likely this talent is limited only to music.
</li></ul></li><li> It's implied that Hiruma from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> has this kind of memory. It's particularly noticeable when he's playing Black Jack in a casino and memorized every single card that was taken from the deck and winning that way, or when Mamori creates review sheets for hand signals. Before she gives it out to the team, Hiruma snatches it away, flips through it, and then burns it. When Mamori says that Hiruma didn't even read it, Hiruma demonstrates that he did memorize it by sending her a message that "the team manager secretly ate all the cream puffs."
<ul><li> Heinrich Shultz of the German National Team is outright stated to have this, and he uses it to predict an opponent's moves with absurd accuracy just by remembering their previous games (his 4.2 second 40 yard dash certainly helps).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBookworm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteBookworm">Sheska</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is the trope <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a>. When the library containing Dr. Marcoh's notes burns down, Sheska, a former employee, manages to write them all down from memory, and is subsequently hired to rewrite possibly the <em>entire library</em>- this being the main branch and containing legal documents as well. In her case, her perfect recall seems to be limited to only what she has read, stemming from her obsession with books and reading.
<ul><li> Kimblee also has a photographic memory, unfortunately. He uses this to torture a man by reciting every murder that he committed in a previous bloody war and when he instantly recalls Scar's face from a group of Ishvalans (several of them Scar's family) that he killed.
</li><li> Vato Falman is able to recall every detail and information in any location without leaving physical evidence which is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessMaster">Roy Mustang</a> picked him as one of his subordinates.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TallDarkAndSnarky">Naoki Irie</a> from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItazuraNaKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ItazuraNaKiss">Itazura Na Kiss</a></em>. He doesn't study because he remembers everything he sees. He comes across the love letter Kotoko wrote to him (that he had refused reading initially) while she is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentCohabitation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentCohabitation">asleep</a> and then later proceeds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkAss">recite it verbatim in front of their families to tease her</a> earning him a well deserved slap.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KagerouProject" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/KagerouProject">Kagerou Project</a></em> takes this one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shintaro Kisaragi</span>, whose eye-power is "Retaining-eyes", which basically means that they remember every single thing they've ever seen and experienced - even across the <em>multiple timelines and adaptations</em> of the series thus far. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Even when it lies dormant, he uses it subconsciously, hence his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenGenius">Teen Genius</a> status.

</li><li> Yasuri Nanami from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Katanagatari">Katanagatari</a></em> uses a Photographic Memory to learn Kyoto Ryu, as well as to copy the moves of the Maniwa Insect Squad who attack her.
</li><li> The titular Neuro and Interpol agent Andrew Sixson from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MajinTanteiNougamiNeuro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MajinTanteiNougamiNeuro">Majin Tantei Nougami Neuro</a></em> have eiditic memories. The villain Sicks managed to copy Andrew's photographic memory amongst other things.
</li><li> All of the Uchiha from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto">Naruto</a></em> have this ability, thanks to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalEye">Sharingan</a>. Allows them to learn any technique (that does not involve genetic inheritance, and that the user can physically perform) without fail, and even to forge handwriting.
<ul><li> Shikamaru is implied to have this as well, considering he memorized Tayuya's finger patterns when she uses her flute for her jutsus.
</li></ul></li><li> Mashiro in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/ThePetGirlOfSakurasou">The Pet Girl of Sakurasou</a></em> has a photographic memory that is closer to textbook definitions.

He gets easily flustered and doesn't have a whole lot of self-confidence, but when he remains calm, Shigeru is shown to have a really good memory, like remembering where Ango put scissors that he last used a week ago. Shigeru was also once so slow in finding words he couldn't remember in the dictionary, he simply learned every word in the dictionary by heart.

It seems his memory works like an ordinary human's, not like a computer's. He can forget things, has to study for college exams, doesn't automatically learn foreign languages (e.g., he's never bothered to learn Japanese), etc.
</li><li> Deaf heroine Echo, an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/TheAvengers">Avenger</a> and former lover of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Daredevil">Daredevil</a>, has this ability. Whether it's a mutant power or natural aptitude is never clearly defined.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman">Batman</a> also has eidectic memory. This helps immensely with his detective work but it's also one of the reasons he has never moved on from his parents' murder.
</li><li> A minor DC character called Savant, who is mostly associated with the Bat-family, likewise has photographic memory. His character also experiences problems coming with it to downright <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction">Deconstruction</a> levels of the trope. Because his memories do not become more vague with time, he has to rely on contextual information to sort out whether something he remembers happened last week or a year ago. Worse, when he experiences something traumatic, his memory of it is <em>always</em> as vivid as if it happened yesterday.
</li><li> Also from DC is Bart Allen, who was formerly Impulse, a former <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash">The Flash</a></em> and the second Kid Flash. He superspeed-read <em>the entire San Francisco Public Library</em>. This makes him an exception to most speedsters, who are able to learn something at an accelerated speed (Wally once learned how to, and then did, construct a fully functioning steel bridge in a matter of minutes) but not capable of <em>retaining</em> those memories. Bart's ability may be limited to perfectly recalling what he <em>reads</em>.

He can pass as a master chef, use any fighting style, and even catch a bullet. The 2010 Taskmaster miniseries reveals that this comes at a cost. Copying so many moves has made him forget a lot of <em>other</em> memories - including those about his personal life, like the fact that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he used to be a SHIELD agent, the true origin of his photographic ability and that he has a hot <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpicyLatina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpicyLatina">Spicy Latina</a> as a wife</span>.

This being <em>Star Wars</em>, though, it is referred to as "holographic" memory, which depending on the quality of the hologram is probably more accurate. Coincidentally (or not), both became Intelligence officers, though on different sides of the war. Winter can remember conversations verbatim, and she famously has the drawback of being unable to forget things she's seen <em>at all</em>, so if she witnessed a tragedy she'd remember it as clearly twenty years later as she had the day after. (Winter being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Alderaanian offworld at the time of Episode IV</a>, it gives her a certain melancholy.) She's also known to memorize the layout of Imperial facilities down to the millimeter, allowing her to provide ridiculously detailed maps for Rebel commandos who would later carry out a raid. Loor, meanwhile, could rattle off so many facts in succession that he would scare suspects into confessing (as they would assume that someone so knowledgeable must already have proof of their guilt anyway), but grew to rely overmuch on his memory, letting knowledge doing the work of actual intelligence and making assumptions. (He tried to overcome it when confronted with this flaw, but never quite managed it.)

Much to the chagrin of the victims, who were counterfeiters.
<ul><li> In a different episode he looked at two credit cards for a few seconds, remembered the numbers perfectly, then performed math using the numbers on them.
</li><li> His intelligence is actually discovered this way: he reels off everything that's wrong with a doctored psychotherapy image after taking only a momentary glance at it before knocking it aside (he's supposed to look at it for 60 seconds), because he was irritated and in a hurry, indicating a combination of eidetic memory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SherlockScan">Sherlock Scan</a>-like attention to detail, and super-fast reasoning abilities.

<ul><li> Shawn's mother has the ability to sounds in a similar way to that of her son with objects.

<ul><li> Most role-playing games will have a way for a character to have a perfect memory.

<ul><li> At least in some editions (e.g. 3rd) it can also verge on being a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">Game-Breaker</a> because it cuts the cost of "regular" (non-magic or -psi) mental skills simply in half or even down to one-quarter normal. This can be balanced to some extent by starting point totals (Eidetic Memory itself isn't cheap) and by how much emphasis the campaign puts on using <em>physical</em> skills like just about all combat ones as well.

For reference a starting PC gets a free 7 dots of merits, making this an extremely useful merit that is picked up by nearly EVERY non-physical character, and several physical. Along with this is Encyclopedic Knowledge, where a character is entitled to a roll to know anything through random happenstance. As this is a 4-Dot merit, it's quite common for a person to pick up both of these at character creation to have a character who remembers everything that has happened to him and some things that didn't.
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAwakening">Mage: The Awakening</a></em>, one of the abilities available to advanced members of the Mysterium (collectors of magical lore) is the ability to have an Eidetic Memory for any facts related to the Mysterium (which depending on ST interpretation, can be a fairly broad definition).

At Aspect 2, characters can remember everything they've ever seen or heard, though weaker characters can easily gain this advantage temporarily if necessary. At Aspect 6, characters are capable of memorizing <em>everything ever written</em>.
</li><li> Photographic Memory is an Epic Intelligence Knack in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Scion">Scion</a></em>. The "look at something once and remember it forever" version of this is justified in that, well, the person with the trait is either a god-in-training or some other variety of supernatural being. This gets downright vicious when combined with Scire (the Atlantean Purview) or other "learn something and then forget it" powers - normally you forget what you learn from these powers when they wear off, but the book specifically states you <em>don't</em> if you have Photographic Memory.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/UnknownArmies">Unknown Armies</a></em> sourcebook distinguishes between "photographic memory" and "eidetic memory", defining them for the purposes of the game as (respectively) the ability to consciously look at a scene for a moment and recall everything about it, and the ability to recall the gist of anything they have ever read.

After looking at Cyborg's blueprints, he was able to months later not only copy the technology, but adapt it to various weapons (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BFG">BFGs</a>, robot armies, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BodyHorror">himself</a>...)
</li><li> An old Russian cartoon involves a man visited at night by an alien, who grants him certain abilities, including telepathy, eidetic memory, X-ray vision, the ability to read a closed book in a second, and mad math skills. One interesting scene involves him walking by a book seller, who is advertising a brand-new novel. He glances at it and says he has read better. When the people complain that he couldn't possibly have read the book, he has them pick a page at random and have him recall it from memory. He recites the words verbatim, including a a line-wrapped word from the previous page. He ends up losing these powers by accident at the end when he tells a couple of thieves "Game over", which is actually the code phrase implanted by the alien in case the man doesn't like his gift.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle">Rocky and Bullwinkle</a></em> arc, Bullwinkle demonstrated the ability to remember everything he ever ate during his lifetime. When he ate a banana on which Boris Badenov had written a secret formula he had stolen, Bullwinkle was able to recite the formula by memory (although he didn't have any idea what it was).
</li><li> Pinkie Pie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em> has a truly phenomenal memory for details, ranging from the precise date of everypony in town's birthday, exact time and location for every single party she throws, literary content down to the page number from a book she barely glanced, to being able to literally recognise a duplicate of an image she saw for less than a second. (It doesn't mean she can perfectly recall everything she remembers; in "Party of One" she was so wrapped up planning an "after-birthday" party for her pet alligator she totally forgot <em>her own</em> birthday.)
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpidermanTheAnimatedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpidermanTheAnimatedSeries">Spiderman The Animated Series</a></em>, Felicia Hardy's father was a notorious cat burglar with a photographic memory. As a youth he was duped by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedSkull">Red Skull</a> into spying on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> project that created <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/CaptainAmerica">Captain America</a> and he memorized the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSerum">Super Serum</a> formula. When he was later tried for his crimes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NickFury">Nick Fury</a> took him into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody to keep the secret safe. Even decades later he remembers the formula perfectly.
</li><li> Mysto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Mixels">Mixels</a></em> has a literal one. He's able to create an aura sphere and flip through memories of his past like a slide show.
</li><li> In the animated <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MisterT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MisterT">Mister T</a></em> series, there are occasional references to Kim having one.

Not only does this serve him well as an artist - he's able to accurately sketch a view of a room he hasn't seen in months - it also comes in handy in his endeavors as a self-taught mage, letting him perfectly recreate magic runes after only seeing them once.

<ul><li> Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM), also known as hyperthymesia, is the talent to recall extremely specific personal (i.e. autobiographical) data. This does not extend outside of the self - so for instance, they may remember what they wore on a specific day of the week, but they wouldn't remember what was going on in the news that day unless it impacted them personally in some way. However, people who exhibit this trait also appear to exhibit symptoms of hoarding and OCD-like symptoms, and it is suggested that the actual cause for their extremely good personal recall (and their inability to recall other facts about those dates) is related - because they constantly reinforce their memories, via diary entries and keeping objects and obsession with dates, they reinforce these memories.
</li><li> Young children have very strong, short-term recall; chimpanzees may as well. It is not known why humans lose this ability, but it may be because as they develop speech and other things, they need to use their brain for things other than memorizing the world around them; it is possible that some humans with extremely good short-term recall may have never lost this ability, or have regained it via practice.
</li><li> Stephen Wiltshire is an autistic man who can take a helicopter ride over a city and draw very detailed pictures of what he saw, producing panoramas in the days after his flights. They are not "perfect", but are quite accurate, often down to the number of windows and columns visible on various buildings.
</li><li> As previously noted, actress Marilu Henner of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em> fame possesses some form of this. Coincidentally, her late co-star Andy Kaufman was also blessed with a phenomenal memory, being able to perform his role without rehearsal.
</li><li> A man in Russia was born with this. While initially this helped him become a scholar, it also eventually drove him mad because he remembered every last horrible thing ever done to him, culminating in his suicide at age 30.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BillClinton">Bill Clinton</a> has been noted for his extraordinary memory, such as being able to perfectly recall phone numbers decades after he last called them. This came in especially handy during teleprompter mishaps during his presidency, as he was able to recite large sections from memory, rather than ad-lib, while the correct text was being uploaded.
