</p><p>This can originate from the author intentionally playing with the closeness of the characters' relationship and slipping into romance, even though nothing serious was supposed to come out of it. In some works, especially comedy ones, this is usually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> involving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a>, and can involve a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiggingYourselfDeeper">Digging Yourself Deeper</a> speech: "It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike">Not What It Looks Like</a>! She's my sister!" "...that's DISGUSTING!"
</p><p>There is another variation, when the attraction itself is textually there, but the characters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodRelated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodRelated">not literally blood related</a>, so openly sexual relationships can also have incestuous subtext. For example, in Japanese works, girls might use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseSiblingTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseSiblingTerminology">Japanese Sibling Terminology</a> for a guy (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">or especially</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneeSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneeSama">a girl</a>) they are in love with.

And Keith after meeting with Mira and accepting her on his side makes her wear dress and all dinner looks like... a date. When Keith <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">becomes good</a> they share some sweet moments and she even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuminescentBlush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LuminescentBlush">BLUSHES</a> then they talk.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BetrayalKnowsMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BetrayalKnowsMyName">Betrayal Knows My Name</a></em>: Touko and Tsukumo are rather close. Also, if you count the equation 'Zweilt partner = Couple'...
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach">Bleach</a></em>: Yuzu is a bit too into Ichigo after the time-skip. There are multiple scenes that can be interpreted as her having a crush on her big brother. In the epilogue, as Karin implies that Yuzu has no problem with her nephew Kazui rooting around in her room being given a "free pass" like Ichigo.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Chobits">Chobits</a></em>: It turns out the tragic backstory that forms the basis of Chii ending up on Hideki's doorstep is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> she and her "twin" were created as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementGoldfish">Replacement Goldfish</a> for the children that her creators could never had...except Freya, the older of the two, fell in romantic love with her creator and had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">Heroic BSoD</a> over the fact that 1) he's already <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried">Happily Married</a> and 2) he sees her as his daughter</span>.

<ul><li> Tomoya once has a weird <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot">Imagine Spot</a> about shipping <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">Sunohara with his sister</a>.
</li><li> Tomoya seems to have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleSisterHeroine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleSisterHeroine">little sister kink</a> in general, as he was <em>very</em> into it when Sunohara's little sister Mei started calling him <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseSiblingTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JapaneseSiblingTerminology">'niichan'</a>. He doesn't actually have a little sister, though.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>
<ul><li> Joshua is <em>very</em> obsessed with his older sister Rosette after he gets Chrono's horns <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatInsanity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComesGreatInsanity">and they turn him insane</a>. It's later revealed to (probably) be because of a forgotten promise to himself that he would grow up "as fast as he could" so he could protect Rosette, but the way he talks about her and embraces her when they reunite really makes it seem like he has a thing for her. It doesn't help that he calls Fiore, whom he seems to have a crush on, "sister" at one point in the story. (And in fact, in the anime version he actually mistakes Fiore for his sister most of the time, but still has a few shippy scenes with her.)
</li><li> In the manga version, Aion brings the severed head of Pandaemonium so close to his face it almost looks like he might have been kissing her. (His back is turned in the panel prior, so it's hard to say for sure.) <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's later revealed that Pandaemonium is Aion's mother.</span>
</li><li> A (possibly) accidental example in the anime version: Chrono and Aion are portrayed as having been close friends in flashbacks, with Chrono saying at one point that Aion was "like a brother" to him. However, a later flashback has Aion bringing Chrono's face so close to his that they almost kiss. This scene is infamous among fans of the original manga, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">since Chrono and Aion are actually twins in the manga version</span>.
</li><li> Implied to have gone down between <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Bird's Nest</span> and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his younger brother Michel</span> before <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Michel</span> died. Although, since Bird's Nest isn't always a very reliable narrator, and the entirety of being a trapeze artist in the manga gives off an erotic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Subtext">Subtext</a> this is still very much up in the air.
</li></ul></li><li> Many in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em>, to the point that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/IncestSubtext/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/IncestSubtext/CodeGeass">it needed its own page</a>. Of course, everybody already knows about Lelouch and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">memetic</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct">siscon</a>, who started a war for his sister Nunnally's sake, but an even better example of this trope would have to be the last episode, where they both tell each other "I love you" using the Japanese terms <em>aishiteru</em> and <em>aishite imasu</em>, which are generally used for romantic affection. Lelouch has this with his half-sister Euphemia, as well.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ACruelGodReigns">A Cruel God Reigns</a></em>: This is played with throughout the series with Jeremy and his mother Sandra. Although mostly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a> in the thoughts of the other characters, there were a few quick hints that suggest serious subtext-a few panels that creepily seem to show Sandra kissing a very young Jeremy on the lips after telling him to call her by her first name after the death of his father, and thoughts from Jeremy along these lines:
<div class="indent"> <strong>Jeremy</strong>: I loved Sandra. She was my best friend. No. She was my lover.
</div></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">Akihiko and Haruhiko Beppu</a> from the second season <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteHighEarthDefenseClubLove">Cute High Earth Defense Club LOVE!</a></em> are fond of touching each other, get extremely close to each other, drape themselves over one another at the beginning of their duet sequence, and the ending theme just kicks things into overdrive.
</li><li> The director of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure">Digimon Adventure</a></em> episode 21 intended this for Hikari and Taichi.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em> joked a bit about twins Koji and Koichi's relationship with a scene where Koji as MagnaGarurumon gallantly saves Koichi from Crusadermon's clutches. The two brothers then proceed to look at each other intensely as Koichi thanks Koji for rescuing him and Koji says how glad he is that Koichi is safe, all with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveBubbles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveBubbles">Love Bubbles</a> for a background and an approving <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshade Hanging</a> by Crusadermon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em>:
<ul><li> The game has Komui and Lenalee Lee has the <a class="urllink" href="http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/787/dgrayman09100.jpg">room,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> that Komui designed for her. Their moments during the zombie arc don't help either.
</li><li> Mana and Nea, though it's complicated <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> since <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewYourself">both of them are halves of the Millennium Earl</a></span>. In their reunion they embrace closely, touch each other's faces tenderly, and Mana even says that although he has a mission to complete he has always felt the need to be with Nea more strongly than anything.
</li></ul></li><li> The manga for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DotHackLegendOfTheTwilight">.hack//Legend of the Twilight</a></em>. The anime however, removes the subtext, causing fans to dub the series as <em>.hack//Twincest</em>.
</li><li> Mairu and Kururi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara">Durarara!!</a></em> seem to go past subtext. The two share a kiss in the second <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OVA">OVA</a>, and are particularly touchy-feely with each other if their dialogue in the chatroom is anything to go by.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElderSisterLikeOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheElderSisterLikeOne">The Elder Sister-like One</a></em> has a lot of ship tease between Chiyo and Yuu, though they <em>technically</em> aren't siblings in any real sense of the word (she's a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/CthulhuMythos">Great Old One</a> who made a contract with him to act as his older sister rather than an actual relative). This isn't helped by the fact that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BleachedUnderpants" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BleachedUnderpants">the series was originally a hentai</a> before it was picked up for serialization (or the fact that said hentai is apparently canon).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyUnlimited" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FinalFantasyUnlimited">Final Fantasy: Unlimited</a></em> has brothers Shiroi Kumo and Akai Kiri, who are so obsessed with each other that anything one of them does has something to do with the other in some way, shape, or form. At the start of the series, it has been twelve years since they've last seen each other, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and hell, Kiri's been <em>dead</em> all that time, too</span>. Their reunion features a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SayMyName">Say My Name</a> and furiously clashing swords. Let's not even get into the soul dragons.
</li><li> Gou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em> has a thing for muscles. Apparently her brother Rin is no exception. She doesn't drool over him like she does Haruka but she seems a bit <em>too</em> into his swimmers physique.
</li><li> There's a reason Edward and Alphonse are a very popular pairing for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>. It's even worse in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">2003 anime</a>; it focuses heavily on the brothers and their extreme devotion to each other (ironically, considering it's the second anime that's called <em>Brotherhood</em>), and downplays their relationships with other characters. Ed has at least three love interests but none of them get anywhere on screen. He spends a majority of the series, and especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a>, focusing on Al.
</li><li> Otori Itsuki and Hiragi Tsubasa from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HighSchoolStarMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/HighSchoolStarMusical">High School Star Musical</a></em> have a fair amount of ship tease between them before it's revealed they're brothers. And even past that, the teasing between them continues.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/InfiniteStratos">Infinite Stratos</a></em>, the main character Ichika Orimura is suspected of this in regard to his older sister, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotTeacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotTeacher">Chifuyu</a>, who looks <em>"better than a model"</em> in his own words. This came to a head during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a> when she comes out wearing a skimpy black bikini <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">that he inadvertently picked out for her</span> and his subsequent reaction to it. Charles, one of the girls vying for Ichika's affections, is <em>not</em> amused and even slightly downcast at the thought of having "Orimura-<em>sensei</em>" as a rival. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalancedHarem">girls</a> talk with Chifuyu later that night and she declares (after a stiff drink) that they should strive to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySisterIsOffLimits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySisterIsOffLimits">"get to her level"'</a> to have Ichika for themselves. Chifuyu herself isn't immune to the speculation, especially after this confession to a fellow teacher:
<div class="indent"><strong>Chifuyu</strong>: "It's not......like that......no, didn't I say before that I don't have special feelings towards that guy, but how can I say it......a little brother should belong to his older sister, right?"
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MaiHime">Mai Hime</a></em>, there is some between Mai and her younger brother Takumi. Yuuichi and Akira both suspect that Takumi has a sister complex. Takumi is initially Mai's most important person (needed to summon her Child, although <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">by the time he dies, Yuuichi has replaced him</span>), and she becomes upset when he, seeking to become independent, appears to be drifting away from her.
</li><li> Manga serialized in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MangaTimeKirara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/MangaTimeKirara">Manga Time Kirara</a></em> are usually known for their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">Les Yay</a>. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CastleTownDandelion">Castle Town Dandelion</a></em>, however, have lots of incest subtexts instead of homoerotic ones. Provided the cast being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyNumberedSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassivelyNumberedSiblings">Massively Numbered Siblings</a> (9 of them), several pairing exists, sometimes doubles as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">twincest</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MariaWatchesOverUs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/MariaWatchesOverUs">Maria Watches Over Us</a></em> is notorious for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LesYay">incredibly gay</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HideYourLesbians">never really having any couples</a>. Yoshino gets paired up with her cousin, Rei, and they have a really close bond.
</li><li> Chiaki and Kana from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MinamiKe">Minami-ke</a></em> seem to show rather unsisterly affections towards Haruka, regularly fawning over her and showering her with praise. Perhaps it might be because she's their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute">Parental Substitute</a>, but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeachEpisode">Beach Episode</a> is very suspect, where they're incredibly eager to see her in a bikini.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a></em>, there are rather questionable actions Gihren Zabi takes in the series concerning his sister Kycilia. Firstly there's the indifferent behavior Gihren has towards Garma and Dozle's deaths, and having no qualms with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">killing Degwin</a>, but yet specifically stating that he plans to rule the new Zeon with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TermsOfEndangerment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TermsOfEndangerment">"dear sister"</a></em>. Then also going out of his way to make sure Kycilia was warned about the Solar Ray firing by a messenger so she wouldn't be killed, the same weapon that intentionally killed daddy. And of course there's the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenEyedMonster">dark tone of voice</a> he used when Kycilia <em>dared</em> to mention having Char pilot the Zeong, saying "Char, once again. You're obsessed with him." Not coming to the logical conclusion that Kycilia might have chosen Char due to his newtype potential, but getting emotional over it instead. Completely one-sided, it's a mixture of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush">Gihren</a> imagining <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnresolvedSexualTension">sexual tension</a> to feed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousIncest">his fantasy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirdsOfAFeather">because she shares some of his beliefs</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut">but of course cannot say anything about it</a>. Kycilia is of course <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IDidntMeanToTurnYouOn">unaware to any of this conflict</a> and rather cares more about their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">dead dad</a>. Can lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoYay">No Yay</a> for obvious reasons.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamTheOrigin">Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin</a></em> version of Char's first encounter with Sayla their fight scene is staged in such a way that it looks uncomfortably like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttemptedRape">he's trying to force himself on her</a>. To his (very small) credit he does get a very subtle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap">Oh, Crap!</a> moment when he realizes who she is.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Monster">Monster</a></em>, it's played with between twin siblings Johan Liebert and Anna/Nina. Johan has quite the obsession over Nina, and she is probably the only person in the world that he cares about enough for people to try to hold Nina hostage knowing that it'll lure Johan out and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he's willing to eradicate his existence merely to make her happy</span>; Nina initially cannot remember Johan due to a post-traumatic induced amnesia, and when he begins sending her anonymous "romantic" emails (e.g., <em>"I was born to smother you with flowers."</em>), she assumes that it's from a secret admirer.

<ul><li> In Chapters 589 and 590, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sasuke and Itachi</span> both admit that they love each other, and the word for 'love' is the deeply romantic <em>aishiteru</em>. Yes, you can argue it was done in a <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">brotherly</span> way.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KissingCousins">Neji and Hinata</a> often give this vibe, every time they have screentime together. Although they are supposed to come off as cousins (though they're technically half-siblings), they strangely give a romantic vibe mixed in that apparent familial affection.
<ul><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Canon">canon</a>, Neji's reaction upon seeing Hinata the first time was to remark about her beauty.

Neji gets so angry when he hears about Hinata trying to date Naruto, that it's not even brotherly protection anymore, but plain jealousy, because he attacks Hinata furiously, saying: "Never...you and Naruto...doing things like that...it's...<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstoppableRage">an infamy</a></em>!". He also imagines Hinata in a spandex suit that Guy-Sensei tries to dress her with, at one point, and Hinata asks him in his fantasy <em>How do I look, Neji?</em>, before Neji snaps out of it quickly, snatches the suit from Guy-Sensei and tears it apart.

Araragi says at one point "If you weren't my sister, I'd fall in love with you." Then there's the infamous toothbrushing scene, which in true <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioShaft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioShaft">Shaft</a> style gleefully toes a <em>very</em> thin line between subtext and text.

Being that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElephantInTheRoom">Elephant in the Room</a> of the series, which results in a constant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillTheyOrWontThey">Will They or Won't They?</a> between Kyousuke and his sister Kirino.

</li><li> There's also the Hitachin twins, Hikaru and Kaoru. While they do share a very strong bond, they play up the incestuous subtext when performing their duties for the club. The relationship is a lot more developed in the manga, where, even though it's still clearly brotherly, it can be interpreted as something else. Kaoru sacrifices so much for Hikaru it's not hard to think of his interest as slightly romantic.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PandoraHearts">PandoraHearts</a></em>: Gil's younger brother, Vincent, is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere">extremely possessive</a> of him.

</li><li> This is the point of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PleaseTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PleaseTwins">Please Twins!</a></em>, although the two girls promise that whichever one is the sister can't be romantically involved with Maiku. Until they KNOW, though, both girls are very protective of another girl having a possible relationship with their possible brother. Of course, the series certainly implies that their promise wouldn't necessarily preclude the two girls being more than friendly with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolgirlLesbians">each other</a>, especially given the amount of time they spend <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanService">"skinshipping"</a> together <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuroScene" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FuroScene">in the bath</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RevolutionaryGirlUtena">Revolutionary Girl Utena</a></em> has several examples:

There's also an instance of her peeping on him in the shower. However, the concept of actual incest confuses her, and the time when it's hinted that they might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodSiblings">Not Blood Siblings</a> she becomes distraught because she thinks it means she's no longer special.
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Anthy and her brother Akio at first appear to be another case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherWorship">Big Brother Worship</a>, then it ends up it's not subtext but text, and ends up being a case of Akio sexually abusing his sister.</span>
</li><li> A lot could be read into the Kaoru twins' relationship, Kozue likes to tease Miki by pushing her breasts into his back when he's carrying her, and her comments about them being wild animals is suspect, and she acts really jealous of Miki's crush Anthy and tries to sabotage their relationship. It's even more blatant in the manga, where Kozue takes over Nanami's characterization.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em>:
<ul><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> Cloverway dub creates an interesting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">inversion</a> with Haruka and Michiru/Amara and Michelle. The romantic subtext is <em>meant</em> to be there... but they're not supposed to be cousins in the original. The company that decided to make them cousins did so for the exact reason of preventing there being any openly gay people in the show, without actually changing enough other stuff to even try and hide how they feel for each other, just hoping no one would think it's odd for two cousins to be THAT devoted to each other.
</li><li> Chibiusa seems to have a crush on her future-uncle Shingo and a positively Freudian relationship with her future mother Usagi (who she looks down on) and her future father Mamoru (who she idolizes).
</li></ul></li><li> The second episode of <em>Saishuu Shiken Kujira</em> has a scene with Mutsumi being woken up by his younger sister knocking on his door. As she's just as tired as he is, she falls on top of him as he goes to open the door, and he then spends a few moments thinking of how nice she smells, until he snaps out of it.
</li><li> In Episode 5 of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ServantXService" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ServantXService">Servant × Service</a></em>, Hasebe shows up at his sister Kaoru's house with his drunken coworker Lucy. When Hasebe says he and Lucy need a place to stay for the night, Kaoru immediately thinks that her younger brother is trying to proposition her for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeWaySex">three-way</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AThreesomeIsHot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AThreesomeIsHot">She doesn't seem to hate the idea, either</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SingYesterdayForMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SingYesterdayForMe">Sing "Yesterday" for Me</a></em>, Shinako sees Rou and his father as family, and treats Rou like a little brother that she feeds and cares for. She is still emotionally committed to Rou's brother, her dead crush, which would make Rou her brother-in-law. However, Rou has romantic feelings for her that he demands she reciprocate, and while she doesn't feel the same way, she refuses to give him space or sharply reject him, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> and even breaks up with Rikuo because she's afraid of hurting Rou's feelings</span>, which emboldens Rou to keep pursuing her. The result is a weird quasi-romance between the two with strong <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">BrotherSister Incest</a> undertones, even though they're not actually related.
</li><li> As the title suggests, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SisterPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SisterPrincess">Sister Princess</a></em> is full of this, particularly with the older sisters to their brother: one actively flirts with him, one gets from him a hairpin that used to be another man's gift to his wife, and one <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">was his lover in a previous life</span>. Oh, and all of them get to have a fake wedding with him. And that's just the start.
</li><li> Rito and Mikan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ToLoveRu">To Love-Ru</a></em>, particularly on Mikan's part, getting jealous and lonely when Rito pays attention to other girls. Then there is the time Rito said that he thought of Mikan as "a special existance beyond even a sibling".

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/XMan">X-Man</a></em>, there was a very strange example, even by the standards of both this trope and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TangledFamilyTree">the Grey-Summers family</a>. with Nate Grey and Maddie Pryor, as epitomised in <a class="urllink" href="https://78.media.tumblr.com/be441d5006070648c856e52f9415408b/tumblr_nmadcj8Zcs1rw95j3o1_1280.jpg">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> cover. Maddie is the clone of Jean Grey and biological mother of Cable, and Nate is the teenage <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em> counterpart of Cable, created from Jean and Scott's DNA. And yes, she is holding him with a suggestive expression while licking her lips, and yes, the cover does say "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IfICantHaveYou">If Madelyne Pryor can't have Nate... No one will!</a>". Now, this is where it gets <em>really</em> weird...
<ul><li> First, after Nate wound up in the main Marvel Universe at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AgeOfApocalypse">Age of Apocalypse</a></em>, he instinctively reached to Jean (he'd met <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AoA">Ao A</a> Jean and recognised a connection between them, but didn't know the details). Being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper">Reality Warper</a>, he accidentally resurrected Maddie as an amnesiac psychic ghost who happened to leech off Nate's powers to exist. He was physically 17, she was somewhere in her twenties. Both were unaware of his heritage and there was a LOT of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> between them: he described her green eyes as 'beguiling' and talked about how she made him smile, and Maddie noted how there was something 'special' between them, remarking that their meeting was 'destiny', with more than one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlmostKiss">Almost Kiss</a> between them.
</li><li> Later, Maddie was lured away by Selene, regaining both powers and memories, whereupon she popped in and out of Nate's life, acting as a textbook <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere">Tsundere</a> towards an often bewildered Nate, acting incredibly jealous whenever any woman showed even the slightest sign of interest in him (which was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChickMagnet">frequently</a>), to the point of <em>murdering</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse">her main theoretical rival, Threnody</a>. Even after Nate figured out just who she was to him, and seemed to step very firmly back from any romance, Maddie's attitude didn't change all that much (as the cover shows).
</li><li> All this could be taken as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble">Relationship Writing Fumble</a> if it weren't for the fact that the writing staff enthusiastically encouraged the shippers in the letters column, with the narration explicitly noting on their visit to Paris how 'they could be young lovers out for a stroll'.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> comic "The Simpsons Winter Wingding 2" there is a story titled "VSI: Valentive Scene Investigators" where Lisa receives, anonymously, a letter valentine. Later Bart admits he wrote it only to encourage Lisa, because previously she was depressed at not receiving a letter valentine. At the end of the story, the whole school laughs at them both.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MadameMirage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/MadameMirage">Madame Mirage</a></em> provides a peculiar example: after her sister Angie is murdered, Harper creates a hyper-sexualized holographic version of her, the eponymous Mirage, to avenge her. Harper's explanation is that with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy">everyone paying attention</a> to the impossibly well-endowed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FemmeFatale">Femme Fatale</a> Mirage, no one would be looking for scrawny little Harper. Except that Mirage still looks just like a hyper-sexualized version of Harper's sister Angie, when Harper could just as easily made her look like someone not connected to Harper in any way. So it kind of comes off as Harper acting out her repressed lust for Angie.
</li><li> The villainous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite">Puppeteer Parasite</a> Abyss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LesLegendaires" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/LesLegendaires">Les Légendaires</a></em> considers the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">former villain</a> Tenebris to be his sister, due to both of them having been created artificially by their "father", the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilSorcerer">Evil Sorcerer</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Darkhell</a>. However, the way he acts toward her (referring to her as <em>"his"</em> Tenebris, openly stating he loves her, restraining her with suspectly tentacle-like energy structures and forcibly opening her mouth with it...) sounds a lot more like some kind of twisted romantic love/sexual desire rather than brother affection...
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour">Fantastic Four</a>: Unstable Molecules</em>, Jonathan Storm has a crush on the comic book character Vapor Girl, unaware that she's based on his sister Susan Storm.

Of course, she did not remember him or recognize him and thought of her stepfather as her father, and did not know he had returned. So when he went to meet her and try to get to know her, without revealing who he really was, she thought he was trying to pick her up, and clearly was attracted to him, even though she turned him down. Later, after she found out the whole story, she started to have dreams in which he was a knight in shining armor rescuing her. Sometime after that, she got romantically involved with his best friend, who was also her godfather. All things considered, there was pretty clear subtext that her feelings for him were not altogether daughterly.

</li><li> In mythology Hippolyta is the daughter of Ares and the Amazon Queen Otrera. While her parentage is generally left vague this is essentially her assumed parentage in all DC realities unless otherwise stated. When Wonder Woman's fatherless conception was gotten rid of for the New 52 the writers made Zeus her father, and did nothing to Hippolyta's parentage meaning that Diana is the result of her mother having sex with her own grandfather, even if it's never actually addressed in the comic leaving it entirely in the subtext. This also means that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HerculesUnbound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HerculesUnbound">Hercules</a> raped his own niece when he forced himself on Hippolyta.

Joel Gideon is a ceaseless womaniser and his daughter is a blossomingly beautiful young lady. In more than one scene she deliberately makes him feel awkward by talking about sex. The scene where they dance together shows how comfortable they are with each others' bodies in a <em>non-sexual</em> capacity. By placing the ideas of "family" "dancing" and "sexuality" in our minds the film highlights how un-confused the issues are in the minds of the characters. Dancing is not sex, dancing is dancing.

There are also several instances where she kisses him and it's a little more than a peck on the cheek. Aside from that, Oscar flies into the bodies of her lovers while she has sex with them, watching the act from their POV's. He even flies inside of her at the climax and we get an inside view of her vagina during intercourse.

It's particularly evident in the scene where Nuada learns of the attraction between Abe and Nuala; Nuada's reaction is more like that of a jealous lover than a brother defending his sister's honor. The presence of implied incest was confirmed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.superherohype.com/news/featuresnews.php?id=6740">by Nuada's actor.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighSchoolMusical">High School Musical</a></em>: Sharpay and Ryan Evans have a disturbingly close relationship.

A joke is made at one point saying that if Sharpay could play both Romeo and Juliet, her brother would be out of a job, which means that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestuousCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestuousCasting">the twins have no problem playing romantic roles with each other</a>. The song "I Can't Keep My Eyes Off of You" (never made it to the movie — it only appears on the first CD) is a quartet with duets between "Troy" and "Gabriella" and then "Sharpay" and "Ryan" (with only a few parts being the four singing together).

Obvious from a mile away. Notably there's a bit of tension between Nick and Carly's boyfriend Wade that comes across almost like jealousy. The underlying arc of the film also has the two siblings reconciling, with Nick getting to rescue Carly the way a boyfriend would.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama">Played for Drama</a> in <em>Into the Dark: Pure</em>, the Daughters' Day-themed episode of the holiday-based horror Hulu horror movie series. It's about a weekend long "purity camp", run by an evangelical preacher which is disrupted when the girls summon Lilith. The girls take disturbingly wedding-like photoshoots with their fathers, complete with white dress, (purity) ring, and couple-y poses, during which the main character Shay is visibly uncomfortable. Some of the dresses they have actually <em>are</em> wedding dresses; the preacher's daughter Lacey has a dress which came with a veil, which the cameras linger on ominously. And, of course, the point of the weekend is for the girls and their fathers to sign a contract in which the fathers promise to guard the girls' purity until they're married and it's time to hand it over to their husbands. Combined with how controlling many of the fathers are, the pastor's weird touchy-feely-ness and habitual one-on-one "chats" with the girls, the unseen but traumatizing "Box", the fact other adults are not allowed to come (not even the girls' mothers), and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> the literal <em>cage</em> kept around for "disobedient" girls</span>, it all winds up pointing somewhere very gross. Lucky thing Lilith shows up to ruin the party.
</li><li> The 1992 French movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLover">The Lover</a></em>, adapted from the eponymous novel by Marguerite Duras. The female protagonist has a sexual vibe with her younger brother — the sight of the two of them dancing closely is enough to drive the titular character to a jealous fury.

(In the original novel the incest is quite explicitly mentioned.) The original film version showed a very possessive and not at all chaste kiss between Eleanor and her son Raymond, and the 2004 remake featured heavy subtext in every scene that showed them together, including some very ambiguous touching and kissing moments. In the novel, Raymond's mother had an incestuous relationship with her father. When <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her brainwashed son is under her control she remarks how much he looks like her father and makes him do what she wants.</span>
</li><li> In the French movie <em>Les mariés de l'an II</em>, Jean-Paul Belmondo plays a Frenchman from Nantes who is trying to get a divorce from his wife at the height of the Reign of Terror. In the course of the resultant misadventures, the two spouses for a time hook up with other partners, the wife with an aristocrat leading a group of royalist guerilla fighters in the Vendée and the husband with that aristocrat's sister (who is also her brother's comrade in arms). When they find out, it is not just the husband and wife who become very jealous of each other, but also the brother and the sister. In the end the new pairs break up and the aristocratic siblings ride off together, remarking on how one won't let the other have a romantic partner and how they are both doomed...

At that point, she was topless with a very sheer bra that didn't leave much to the imagination. He seems a little too delighted in seeing her breasts and tells her she has "bodacious boobies". Later, he refers to her as his "beloved sister" and asks her date if he is going out with her because of her "big cha-chas".
</li><li> This is brought up in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnAClearDayYouCanSeeForever" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OnAClearDayYouCanSeeForever">On a Clear Day You Can See Forever</a></em>. Tad Pringle points out that, since he is just as much in love with Daisy as Doctor Chabot is, perhaps he (Tad) might make a suitable match for her. When Dr. Chabot points out that Tad is Daisy's brother, Tad responds with, "Only by marriage... she's my step-sister, not my blood-sister."
</li><li> The Canadian indie movie <em>Punch</em> has a female lead with an Electra Complex because her mother died when she was young and grew obsessively attached to her father out of fear. She still lives with her father despite being old enough to move out, but he's wise enough to refuse her although he doesn't really know what to do with her. When he introduces her to his new girlfriend, his daughter's reaction is to punch her in the face.

Made even more bizarre because she was Delon's real-life wife.

This is because their dynamic is loosely based on the historical Cesare and Lucrezia Borgia, who had such rumors floating around about them even at the time.
</li><li> At the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Serenity">Serenity</a></em>, River is shown watching curiously from an air vent as her brother Simon is having sex with Kaylee, and given her psionic talents, there's innuendo that she's also telepathically reading their sensations.
</li><li> The two Charlies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShadowOfADoubt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ShadowOfADoubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a></em>, being uncle and niece. The Young Charlie tells her Uncle that they have a special bond, that they are soulmates if you will. After that point Uncle Charlie gives Young Charlie a wedding ring. When the relationship sours, Uncle Charlie tries to kill his niece <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouOfAnything">by choking her</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Shame">Shame</a></em> is about a man named Brandon with an extreme sex addiction, who is either viewing porn, looking for sex, jerking off, or indeed doing the deed. He lives with his sister Sissy, and while they don't have sex in the film, they have a pretty close relationship that hints at an unspoken trauma between them. Notably, their first scene together has Brandon accidentally walk in on her taking a shower, and she seems more angry about him disrupting her privacy rather than him <em>seeing her naked</em>, even throwing her towel at him! Later on she starts dating someone and Brandon seems <em>unusually</em> protective of her when that occurs.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharknado2TheSecondOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Sharknado2TheSecondOne">Sharknado 2: The Second One</a></em> the way Ellen playfully teases her daughter Mora in Times Square about her short skirt, pulling it back down herself; and the way she is pressing herself against her daughter's back on the ferry to the Statue of Liberty, Ellen and Mora's level of closeness can seem a little creepy.
</li><li> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteAndTheHuntsman">Snow White and the Huntsman</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodSaveUsFromTheQueen">Queen Ravenna</a>'s relationship with her brother Finn flirts with incest several times. Especially when Ravenna bathes in front of him and, later, he gives her a not-so-brotherly kiss on the shoulder.
</li><li> Between Claudia and her brother Gustav in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteATaleOfTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SnowWhiteATaleOfTerror">Snow White: A Tale of Terror</a></em>. She kisses him at one point, though he's rather terrified. It's also clear Frederich saw his late wife when he danced with Lilli. So does Claudia.
</li><li> Many <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> fans noticed Princess Leia Organa's later claim, that she had "always known" that Luke Skywalker is her brother. Even when she was making out with him?
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VerticalLimit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VerticalLimit">Vertical Limit</a></em> has a plot of Peter climbing K2 to save his younger sister Annie. If you took all the references to their father out of the script, it would come across as a romance instead. This trope is probably the reason Peter gets a kiss out of nowhere from the only other female in the film.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWind1928" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWind1928">The Wind (1928)</a></em>, Letty moves in with her cousin and his wife down South. No incest actually occurs; however, Cora becomes jealous of Letty, not helped by the fact that her husband is so invested in his attractive younger cousin.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWitch">The VVitch</a></em> has Caleb, who is heavily implied to be lusting after his older sister Thomasin, occasionally staring at her chest. He never acts on it, and seems like a good kid otherwise. It's probably a result of entering puberty in an isolated area; Thomasin is literally the only female around besides Caleb's mother and his seven-year-old sister Mercy.

<ul><li> During one of Arianne Martell's POV chapters, she remembers that when she was younger (though we don't know exactly how young) she was travelling through the desert with her uncle Oberyn and her cousins, and she daydreamed about a desert bandit kidnapping her and having his way with her. Judging from the description of the bandit, she imagined him looking a lot like her uncle Oberyn. She feels very uncomfortable about remembering this, so she is clearly aware of what such a daydream implies.
</li><li> Arianne attempts to invoke this trope by dressing in a revealing outfit when expecting to have a confrontation with her father to make the situation really awkward for him.
</li><li> Aeron "Damphair" Greyjoy has a deep-seated hatred and terror of his brother Euron, and associates him with the scream of a rusted hinge, and memories of waking up in the night and thinking "Euron has come again". Though it is not stated explicitly, one can assume that he was sexually abused by his brother.
</li><li> When Victarion Greyjoy and his niece Asha are arguing over who might rule the ironborn, she offers to help him rule as his Hand of the King. Since this is not a tradition of the ironborn (and Victarion is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">quite thick</a>), Victarion at first thinks that when she talks of "ruling beside him" she means being his queen. He finds himself getting aroused at the thought before reminding himself that she is his niece.
</li><li> Teased with Asha and Theon, when he first arrives at Pyke. They go on a horseback ride together and there is a lot of fondling going on and she even grabs his erection a few times. This was done deliberately by Asha posing as a shipwright's wife named Esgred in order to find out his plans. When Theon finds out who she really is, Theon is incredibly disturbed.
</li><li> Though they are not related by blood, Littlefinger is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sansa Stark</span>'s uncle through marriage, and it is very clear to her and the reader that he is sexually interested in her. Not only is he legally her uncle, but she is currently pretending to be his daughter, and addresses him as "father".
</li><li> When Tyrion is confronting his sister, Cersei, about her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">twincestuous</a> relationship with Jaime, he says that it "seems unfair that she should open her legs for one brother and not the other". While he was clearly trying to enrage and mock her, if he had been aware of their incest while growing up with them, it would make sense that his own sexuality might be affected by it. While he is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">planning his revenge on his family from exile</span> he mentions that he wants to rape and murder his sister. While he would be quite happy to kill her, it is unknown if he was being serious about raping her, and even if he was, it would probably be from a wish to hurt and degrade her as much as possible rather than from any true sexual desire.
<ul><li> When Cersei's paranoia gets <em>really</em> bad she's prone to nightmares, which often feature Tyrion in disturbingly sexual situations.
</li><li> When Cersei has taken <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">who she thinks is</span> Tyrion's mistress as a hostage, and Tyrion has her youngest son under his own control, he tries to ensure the woman's safety by saying that whatever happens to her would happen to his nephew, including any beating or rapes (though it is made indisputably clear to the reader that this is just a bluff rather than a serious threat, not least because Tyrion actually likes his youngest nephew).
</li></ul></li><li> In the fourth book it's implied that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSociopath">Joffrey</a> may have abused his younger brother <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildrenAreInnocent">Tommen</a> in a sexual way. He gets interrupted before he gets to say more about it.

One fan theory is that their mother Jamiethiel had the power to deliberately get pregnant with twins, and literally made Torisen as the perfect mate for Jamie, so she would become blood-bound to him before her uncle Gerridon could claim her.
</li><li> The relationship between brother and sister Quentin and Caddy in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSoundAndTheFury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSoundAndTheFury">The Sound and the Fury</a></em>. Quentin is obsessed with his sister's virginity and purity. At one point he lies and claims to have committed incest with Caddy and be the father of her illegitimate child in order to shoulder the blame with her. He later <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> commits suicide due to his heartbreak over Caddy not being pure.

</li><li> While <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersInTheAttic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FlowersInTheAttic">Flowers in the Attic</a></em> has quite a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrotherSisterIncest">actual incest</a> going on, some things are still relegated to subtext. There are hints here and there that Christopher is sexually attracted to, or at least very confused by, his mother.
</li><li> In <em>Graceling</em>, Katsa and Raffin, cousins, have quite a bit of this going on. They are extremely close, call each other things like "My Dear" and had even once considered getting married, but didn't for reasons having nothing to do with being related.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlaineHarris" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlaineHarris">Charlaine Harris</a>' <em>Harper Connelly</em> series, Harper and her step-brother Tolliver get intensely jealous of each other's lovers, none of whom are ever more than brief flings, frequently share hotel rooms and when they don't always make sure to have connecting rooms. They are slowly raising money to buy a house and neither of them ever considers not living together in it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the second book when Harper finds herself thinking about having kids and realizes that she can't imagine them being raised by anyone but Tolliver she realizes her feelings for him and it nearly destroys her</span>.

With August, it's made clear that he is attracted to her, although he hates himself for it and tries to suppress it. Scarlet's a little more ambiguous. She's very flirty and teasing with him, although this could just be a part of her personality (she flirts with Kavik immediately after meeting him as well) and she clearly enjoys making August uncomfortable. August also mentions that Scarlet flirted with him when they were kids, so make of that what you will.

Sophie is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityPet">Morality Pet</a> for Josh, and she's always the one who can bring him around when he's contemplating a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">FaceHeel Turn</a>. Neither character gets a love interest either.

</li><li> Cassie in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIntruders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheIntruders">The Intruders</a></em> behaves very hostile towards her mother Amanda's new fiancée. She doesn't much like his sons either but her behaviour towards him seems more like jealousy. Her brother Joel says a curiously worded line about Cassie not wanting to "share" their mother.

To clarify, they're a destructive couple, but it's suspected by several characters that Heathcliff is Mr Earnshaw's illegitimate son. We never find out whether they're biologically related.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></em>, Dr. Frankenstein's parents adopted a little girl, Elizabeth, as a present for him. He refers to her as his "more than sister". When he goes crazy, she suspects it may be because he's fallen in love with someone else and doesn't want to upset their parents by not marrying Elizabeth. In other words, the parents raised two children to be romantically attracted to each other.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Overenskommelser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Overenskommelser">Överenskommelser</a></em> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonaAhrnstedt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SimonaAhrnstedt">Simona Ahrnstedt</a>, Edvard has sexual fantasies about his cousin Beatrice.

Though there are rumors that the Bene Gesserit intend for them to mate with each other as part of their eugenics program. At the end of the book they do legally get married, but it's clear this is entirely political and Ghanima's eventual children are actually fathered by Farad'n Corrino.

Gudrun also has the power to effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a> people and, while she rarely interacts with her son in person, other characters accuse her of tormenting him and whispering to him in his dreams, though they never elaborate further then that.

By the time <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> aired, everyone including the writers knew about the pairing and ensuing fandom, so the subtext from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> onwards is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">ship teasing</a> and put there by the writers.

Klaus has a history of hating men Rebekah is interested in, and considers himself her constant one and basically the only man worthy of her and the only man she's allowed to love.

Together they create the Bundy Bounce and she has him drooling. A date (Corey Feldman) disses Kelly cause she won't put out, so Bud purposely gives him the measles. Kelly <em>cruelly</em> gets revenge for Bud on a girl who humiliated him.

<ul><li> Half-sisters Morgana and Morgause. Their secret meetings can be seen as not unlike secret lovers having an affair. According to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a>, it was intentional - Morgause was meant to stand as Morgana's love interest. Although, due to the revelation of <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Morgana being Uther's daughter,</span> we can't be sure if Morgana and Morgause are actually related any more. They certainly seem to consider themselves sisters, though.

</li><li> Sam and Dean in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural">Supernatural</a></em> have an extremely close relationship that includes a serious lack of personal space, sharing a room for most of the series, being completely inseparable and acting like a broken-up couple when they are apart for any length of time, jealousy whenever anyone else gets close to either brother, a mock "wedding" in which they stand at an altar and both declare that no one else is more important to either of them than each other, and total insanity whenever one brother believes the other has died. Dean is extremely protective and possessive of Sam, and Sam has given up pretty well everything he's ever dreamed of for Dean and tends to go bonkers whenever he thinks Sam might reject him. By later seasons the brothers are often paralleled to (and compare themselves to) romantic and married couples, such as Amelia and Don in Season 8. This is joked about several times; in "The Monster at the End of This Book", Sam and Dean discover a series of novels detailing their exploits has accumulated a fandom, including in-universe Sam/Dean shippers.

</li><li> All <em>over</em> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBorgias" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBorgias">The Borgias</a></em>, but well, there's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">a reason for that</a>. You've got the main one—<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherAttraction" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherAttraction">Cesare/Lucrezia</a>—which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">becomes canon in Season 3</span>. But you've also got other examples which are most limited to subtext.
<ul><li> There's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MommasBoy">Vannozza/Cesare</a>, who spend the most time together of the parents/children and whom Cesare brings to Lucrezia's wedding despite his father's wishes.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWaltons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWaltons">The Waltons</a></em>, there were a few instances when John-Boy (the eldest son and narrator) and his mother, Olivia seemed to share more than just parent-child closeness. One notable example is the birthday episode when he reads a poem to her, a love poem nonetheless. They interact more like a couple during that scene than a mother and son.
</li><li> This is played for laughs quite a bit on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment">Arrested Development</a></em>. The idea of incest is very deliberately prominent in show, probably to emphasise both how messed-up the Bluth family is, and how obsessed all the family members are with themselves.
<ul><li> Buster very clearly has some kind of Oedipus Complex, and is too much of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild">Manchild</a> to stop himself from saying things that very heavily hint at it. Whenever he gets into an actual relationship, he treats it the same way he does his relationship with Lucille.
<div class="indent"><strong>Buster:</strong> Sister's my new mother, Mother. And is it just me, or has she gotten hotter?
</div></li><li> Lindsay, when she finds out <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's adopted</span>, is convinced that Michael has always harbored a crush on her. As soon as G.O.B. discovers this news, he immediately tries to hit on Lindsay, but she slaps him in the face.
</li><li> George Michael has a not-altogether unrequited crush on Maeby, his cousin.
</li><li> Maeby and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Steve Holt</span> fool around in Season 3, though she calls it off after discovering they're related.
</li><li> G.O.B. and Michael have a slight love/hate relationship, but G.O.B. is also slightly obsessed with his brother. He wrote a song about him, in which he sings, "Everything I do, I do for you," and gets very upset when Michael gets angry at him (which he does fairly frequently). G.O.B. is very physically affectionate with Michael, more so than with anyone else in his family. He loves touching Michael in any way he can, whether it's a hug (which Michael mostly denies, somewhat aggressively), or a hand on the shoulder, or just having their faces uncomfortably close together. In the episode 'Making A Stand', he hugs Michael tightly, and says, "If you feel something moving down there, it's just the bird," but Michael sees said dove walking across the counter during the hug. The implied incestual element in their relationship has even spawned multiple fanfictions.
</li><li> In season 4, G.O.B. asks the unwitting George-Michael to do a favour for him, which ends up being pretending to be his boyfriend so he can get into an exclusive gay club to foil Tony Wonder's performance. G.O.B. admits easily that he tried to first convince his brother Michael, but had no luck. When George-Michael realises the plan, he immediately tries to back out, but G.O.B. doesn't let him leave without a reason. He pretends that they've had an argument, and kisses him just before he can finally get away.
</li><li> At an office Christmas party, Michael attempts to bond with Maeby, his niece, by singing a karaoke duet with her. The song they choose is called 'Afternoon Delight', and they realise as the song goes on that it's a duet about having sex in the afternoon. They quickly stop singing it, and are both embarrassed by the mix-up. Later, George-Michael and Lindsay also sing the song together, again unaware of the sexual nature of the song.
</li><li> In the episode "Shock and Aww", George Micheal harbors a massive crush on his ethics teacher. Lindsay notices George Micheal's interest in his teacher, but she mistakes his feelings and thinks he just admires his teacher and sees her as a replacement mother-figure. Lindsay then tries talking with him about his feelings, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDialogueTwoConversations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDialogueTwoConversations">inadvertedly makes a lot of unfortunate double entendres</a> much to George Micheal's discomfort:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lindsay:</strong> Ah, sounds like you'd like her to be more than just your teacher. There's nothing wrong with that. Although... I must say I'm a little hurt that you haven't considered me. <br/><strong>George Michael:</strong> <em>(gobsmacked)</em> ...You're my aunt. <br/><strong>Lindsay:</strong> That doesn't matter. Aunts can fill that role. Teachers can fill that role. And, someday, you're going to find the right woman to fill that role. But until then... I'll be right across the hall. <br/><em>(Lindsay walks out with a big smile on her face)</em> <br/><strong>Narrator:</strong> Lindsay had never been more proud of anything she had said in her entire life. <br/><strong>George Michael:</strong> ...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">Yikes!</a>

When Julie's mother Paula finds out about this she is horrified...and drops the bombshell that Jason and Julie are actually related as Paula had sex with Jason's grandfather when she was fourteen and got pregnant with Julie. It's then quickly revealed that Jason and Julie didn't actually sleep together.

There was even a scene in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Christine made out with him though it turned out to be a dream.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends">Friends</a></em>
<ul><li> This is a plot point in the episode "The One with the Inappropriate Sister". Rachel's date Danny seems to just be extremely close to his sister, until at the coffee house when he licks icing from her fingers, then she drops it on his pants and wipes it off, then they go upstairs to change pants. When Rachel finally goes to break up with him, Danny and his sister are about to take a bath together.
</li><li> Another episode has a cousin of Ross and Monica played by Denise Richards that is so stunningly beautiful that Ross forgets he's related to her and makes a pass at her. That's probably why she isn't seen at the wedding.
</li><li> Siblings Ross and Monica have no problem with hugging, kissing, holding hands and sitting near each other. The closeness they have is not unnoticed by the other four main characters and is cause for some jokes. Moreover, Ross was Monica's first kiss (he thought she was Rachel).

</div><ul><li> By the way, there is a scene where the dialogue between the two is so loving that Phoebe teases by suggesting to them go to a hotel room.
</li><li> There was also an episode where Monica brought it up solely for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">squick</a> purposes.

</div></li></ul></li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS">NCIS</a></em>, Troian Bellisario appears in two episodes. In the first, "Red Cell" in season 2, DiNozzo and Todd go to McGee's apartment to bring him in to work early for a meeting, and spend several minutes making fun of him for being a nerd; after they leave, Bellisario walks out of McGee's bedroom in her pajamas and takes over the computer game McGee had been playing. The joke being that, unbeknownst to Todd and DiNozzo, McGee had gotten this gorgeous woman into bed the night before. Then, in the season four episode "Twisted Sister," it is revealed that Bellisario's character is actually McGee's sister. And, to add just one more interesting wrinkle, the executive producer of NCIS? Donald Bellisario. And Sean Murray, McGee's actor is Bellisario's stepson. Making them step siblings in real life.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> featured in one episode the family of a Harvard alum, and his two children, a boy and a girl, who are weirdly close—from color coordinated outfits to alluded shared showers. When Lorelai and Rory come over to their place for lunch, Lorelai mercilessly mocks the issue in Rory's ears, much to to the latter's chagrin.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Sanctuary">Sanctuary</a></em> episode "Nubbins", Henry is clearly thinking of other things when Ashley asks him if "he's had a chance to check out her Nubbins," and again when she says "Don't you just want to squeeze them?" While they aren't biologically related, they <em>were</em> raised by the same woman in the same household, making them adopted siblings.

<ul><li> One episode involves a girl who made a celibacy pledge getting pregnant and being terrified that her father would kick her out if he found out. When dad eventually accepts that it was consensual sex (he VERY strongly wanted to believe she was raped so she wouldn't have broken her pledge), he says that she betrayed him, leaving some icky implications, though it's pretty clear that he never actually abused her.
</li><li> In another similar episode a girl collapses <em>at</em> her purity ball and it's learned she's pregnant. The detectives are convinced her brother is the culprit. It turns out it's the family pastor (who had gotten another sister pregnant before, which child was being raised as a sibling by the parents) who tried to marry the girl to avoid being charged with statutory rape.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBradyBunch">The Brady Bunch</a></em> always had something between step-siblings Greg and Marcia, which is made obvious in the movie.
</li><li> <em>Ben and Kate</em> is a show about a brother moving in with his single-parent sister to help her raise her daughter, so this was inevitable. They are sometimes mistaken for a married couple in the show as well.
</li><li> In the CW show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Arrow">Arrow</a></em>, Oliver and his sister Thea. There is an inordinate amount of chemistry between the actors; reportedly they'd met each other prior to the series starting and developed a playful friendship. She starts off rather cold towards him when he returns but warms up upon learning the full details of his experience; the exact same story and dynamic is what they use for Laurel in the show, his <em>actual</em> love interest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a></em>: Richard Castle and his daughter Alexis are extremely close, largely due to his raising her by himself but sometimes it seems to go beyond this. One episode opens with her sitting on his lap which is fine for a little girl but she's college age. The same episode has a scene where he talks to her about the breakup of her long distance relationship and asks "Does this make you feel any better?" She says "No, but this does." and proceeds to cuddle with him. Another episode, which takes place at a science-fiction convention has him see her in a <em>very</em> skimpy cosplay outfit. After confronting her about it he walks away saying "I can't <em>unsee</em> that!" Later on they have an awkward scene together in which they agree not to discuss the matter, the implication being that it might bring up feelings neither wants to acknowledge.
</li><li> Twins Dennis and Dee Reynolds from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ItsAlwaysSunnyInPhiladelphia">It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</a></em>. In "Dennis and Dee Get a New Dad" they are explicitly accused of sleeping with each other by Frank. Furthermore there are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestuousCasting" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncestuousCasting">cast as love interests</a> in Charlie's "Dayman" play. Charlie initially casts Dennis as the villain to avoid the incestuous implications, but Dennis wants to play the hero instead and has no problem with the fact that his sister plays the love interest. Dee, however, complains, and the initially planned kiss between their roles is changed to an embrace. In addition, during the episode "Frank's Back in Business," the siblings along with Mac discover that a patron has left his wallet at the bar, leading Dennis to assume the patron's identity. When they show up to a baseball game via the tickets in the wallet and that person's associates assume that Dennis is the patron and Dee is his wife, the two have no problems playing along with this ruse. Dennis even states that he "gets off" while pretending to be another person, and when Dee questions the ruse, he asks Dee if she wants to "get off" with him. There's also the scattered moments in the series where Dennis <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwLookTheyReallyDoLoveEachOther">expresses his care for Dee's well-being</a> in a way that almost sounds like a grand declaration of love, and while Dee herself seems to brush them off most of the time, it is implied she does return the sentiment.
</li><li> In the American adaptation of the show <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ShamelessUS">Shameless</a></em>, siblings Fiona and Phillip essentially end up as the father and mother figures of their four younger siblings, being that their mother has been gone for some time and they eventually kick their deadbeat father out of the house. Although each has a respective love interest, Fiona loses interest in hers and is heavily disapproving of Phillip's love interest in what could easily be interpreted as jealousy.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest">Cora and Regina's relationship</a> has some seriously incestuous undertones, especially on Cora's part. Cora murders her daughter Regina's fiancée, Daniel, and then marries Regina off to King Leopold, who is still pining for his dead wife Eva, after manipulating the situation so that Regina places the blame for Daniel's death on Leopold's daughter, Snow. Thus, Regina will be trapped in a loveless marriage with no source of comfort but Mommy Dearest. After Regina banishes Cora to Wonderland and later sends Captain Hook to assassinate her, Cora prepares to return the favor until she hears Regina's tearful confession of love (which itself sounds like a monologue to a lover and not a parent) made over Cora's coffin. Cora thus goes into hiding and decides to allow her daughter to cast the Dark Curse, even though she <em>knows</em> that it will not bring Regina the happiness that she so desperately seeks, and will instead cause her to lose everything, because "then she'll need me... And me, I'll help her pick up the pieces." Also, upon arriving in Storybrooke, Cora breaks into Regina's home and <em>sniffs her clothing</em>. Once she and Regina reunite, she's also kind of creepily physical with her as well.

They both freely admit each other are the most important people in their lives, they do stuff together all the time, they both have the same tastes in music and movies, they both get really jealous when the other shows romantic or sexual interest in someone else, and they often sleep in the same bed and spoon.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HopeAndFaith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HopeAndFaith">Hope &amp; Faith</a></em> has the titular two sisters being involved in a couple of moments.

For her part Zoe also values him more than anyone else, always going to him in times of crisis. It's worth mentioning that Jack's ex-wife (Zoe's mother) looks very similar to Jack's sister.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly">Firefly</a></em>, Simon and River's relationship is greatly textured, mixing sibling, parent, doctor, and lover roles with the necessary abandon. Simon and his mei-mei are all each other have in the world. And when River's upset or sick, it's her brother's bed she curls up in.

Shane is shocked to see them holding hands while flirting with him and Liam, Petra agrees to take Liam home but only if he dresses in her brothers clothes and when Shane and Liam leave the twins seem relieved.
</li><li> In <em>Almost Royal</em> the two main characters, who are brother and sister keep referring to each other as "friends with benefits" to their handler's annoyance. The only reason it's subtext is that being both British and rather dim-witted they may not realize what it means in American terms. Maybe.

At first, she insists it is simply a full-length white gown that came with not a veil but a tulle headdress that she chose not to wear, but she realizes it is a wedding dress <em>at</em> the wedding.

Unfortunately, Emily VanCamp (who played Rebecca) and Dave Annable (who played youngest Walker sibling Justin) had such incredible romantic chemistry that the incest subtext became impossible to avoid; it didn't help that VanCamp and Annable started dating while they were on the show together. As such, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLifeWritesThePlot">alterations were made</a>, and it was eventually revealed that Rebecca <em>wasn't</em> William Walker's daughter (Holly had another lover on the side). While this allowed Justin and Rebecca to pursue their romance, it also forced the writers to introduce William's actual illegitimate son, Ryan, who quickly became <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">the most hated character on the show</a>.

</li><li> Pick a Eugene O'Neill play, any Eugene O'Neill play. Odds are you're going to encounter a seriously dysfunctional family vibe, owing to O'Neill's own deep-seated mommy issues, and the fact that he was heavily influenced by Greek theatre, home of the original Oedipus and Electra. The subtext is particularly heavy in <em>Mourning Becomes Electra</em>, a theatrical trilogy which moves the plot of the classic Oresteia to Civil War era New England. To try to sum up the tangle of dysfunction: Lavinia Mannon appears to be totally in love with her father, General Ezra Mannon, and hateful to her mother Christine. Christine murders Ezra, so she can be with the handsome young sailor Adam Brant, but also dotes on her son Orin in an entirely unmotherly way. Orin (suffering mental trauma from his time on the battlefield) returns the affection, but Lavinia manages to enlist him against his mother by informing him about Christine's affair, which sends him into a rage which clearly has more to do with jealousy than any kind of familial loyalty. After Christine is driven to suicide, Orin seems to waver between wanting to kill his sister, and wanting to sexually dominate her. Suffice it to say, Eugene O'Neill was not a happy man.

Clarine will tell every other man she supports with that they can't compare to her charming and handsome brother, throws a fit when another healer treats him, and compliments him directly for being the best-looking man in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">Ragtag Bunch of Misfits</a>.

She also reminds him of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodMarriagePromise">Childhood Marriage Promise</a> from when they were very young, though it's part of her attempts to convince him to stop acting like she's a total stranger. The fact that she and Clarine are both of the Troubadour class is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshaded</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em>.

Their end-game weapons are even named after a pair of incestuous twins from a Wagner opera. If you finish the game with the A support, the ending changes and it's implied they ruled the kingdom together as king and queen. The English version of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemHeroes">Fire Emblem Heroes</a></em> even has a fourth-wall-breaking moment in the Paralogue where the twins first appear in which he addresses the rumors surrounding his relationship with his sister.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemFates">Fire Emblem Fates</a></em> has several examples:
<ul><li> The Avatar can marry any one of his/her adoptive Nohrian siblings <em>and</em> his blood-related Hoshidan siblings, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and while it can be eventually revealed that the Avatar is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodRelated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotBloodRelated">Not Blood Related</a> to the Hoshidans either, almost all of them were raised to think otherwise</span>.
</li><li> Camilla is rather attached to her adoptive brother/sister, the aforementioned Avatar, and as said above is one of the Male Avatar's prospective love interests.
</li><li> Camilla's half-brother Leo, whom she's implied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotiontoParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotiontoParent">have helped raise</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellDoneSonGuy">desperately desires Camilla's affections</a> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">and is revealed <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual">through a guide</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstLove">to have once been in love with her</a></span>.

</li><li> And finally, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Male Avatar and Azura</span> get enough <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> to qualify as each other's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpliedLoveInterest">Implied Love Interest</a>, despite being maternal cousins.

Usually Ragna is portrayed as being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CelibateHero">Celibate Hero</a>, but <em>Jin</em> is obsessed with him thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">Yukianesa</a> warping his feelings. Unfortunately for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Ragna</a>, the game developers fickin' <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">LOVE</a></em> using Yukianesa to warp Jin's feelings.

In the sequel, Nu-13's soul is installed into the chassis of an "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmptyShell">uninstalled</a>" older Unit, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie">Lambda-11</a>, and the more violent aspects of her obsession with Ragna disappear, implying that it's the Murakumos' programming that distort their feelings. It's not-so-subtly implied <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Noel Vermillion</span>, a.k.a. Mu-12 <em>also</em> has a crush on Ragna, which makes it possible that the Murakumos' love is also just a program.
</li><li> In <em>Chronophantasma</em>, this is implied through <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Izanami's</span> interactions with Ragna. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Izanami is an all-powerful death goddess who is possessing the body of his little sister, Saya, and Izanami</span> spends a good portion of the game trying to make Ragna "hers" and get him to join her side.

</li></ul></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FatalFrame">Fatal Frame</a></em> games seem to love this trope, especially the second game, which may as well be called <em>Fatal Frame 2: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Twincest">Twincest</a></em>.

Early in the game, Lymsleia thinks she'll have to marry Frey if he wins the Sacred Games for her hand (Miakis was having a little fun with her), and later she asks if she can sleep with him. ...no, not that way, she's just cold and scared in an unfamiliar place. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldenEnding">Golden Ending</a>, Frey is appointed Commander of the Queen's Knights, the traditional position of the Queen's husband.</span>

Second, while <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she's dying</span>, she mentions that she wants Otacon to look at her "as a woman".

</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MegaMan">Mega Man</a></em>: Mega Man and Proto Man had something going on beyond rivalry, even without taking into account that last fight scene in "Bro Bots" (or hell, the entire episode). They spend just as much time trying to convince the other to defect to their side as they do shooting at each other, and Proto won't let any other Wily-bot touch Mega ("Just remember—Mega Man is <em>mine!"</em>) Plus, he seems rather disinterested in getting his sister to join Wily.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYA-j78XFn4">This scene<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Is there something more subtexty than hold handsing and asking for a "real brother relationship"?
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeManAndTheMastersOfTheUniverse1983">He-Man</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaPrincessOfPower">She-Ra</a> are basically all over each other when they appear together. When riding on horseback He-Man hugs her very tightly from behind, looking a bit more comfortable than a normal sibling would. (But then again, He-Man rides a horse this way with everyone, including males.) The song <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8ZcmMK64Ok">"I Have The Power"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that was created for the "Secret Of The Sword" movie where Adam and Adora first met sounds so much like a love duet it's a little unsettling. It is catchy, though: "Somewhere out there someone needs me. I don't know how or where, but believe me. I'll walk the universe to find her. For better or for worse beside her".
</li><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats">Thunder Cats</a></em>, WilyKat at one point tells his sister WilyKit "You're beautiful when you snarl." It seems <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> caught on to this, as it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EditedForSyndication">cut from later airings and the DVD</a>.
</li><li> Coincidentally, the first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThunderCats2011">Thunder Cats 2011</a></em> has this exchange between Tygra and Lion-O, who are now adoptive brothers:
<div class="indent"><strong>Lion-O:</strong> I'm gonna ring that bell. <br/><strong>Tygra:</strong> And I'm gonna <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalInnuendo">ring yours</a>. (<em>wink</em>)
</div></li><li> Phil and Lil of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats">Rugrats</a>,</em> which is a bit strange since they're only one year old. One episode has the babies put on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighSchoolDance">High-School Dance</a> in the garden and Phil takes Lil. Another episode has them pretending to be lovers in a soap opera. They have strange reactions when they see each other in the buff in "Naked Tommy". When Chuckie discovers that a girl picks on him because she has a crush on him, Lil shoves Phil; when he asks why she did it, she responds "it's because I like you" and they both giggle. It's still apparent in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp">All Grown Up!</a></em>: Phil doesn't take Lil becoming more individual very well, and his reaction to her growing breasts isn't very typical of a brother. Another episode when Phil was hanging out a lot with his sister's best friend, Lil was upset that her friend was taking away her brother from her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superfriends">Superfriends</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderTwins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/WonderTwins">Wonder Twins</a> were more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeAnOldMarriedCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeAnOldMarriedCouple">Like an Old Married Couple</a> than any siblings. Not that real siblings never act in a manner fitting that trope, but these two were <em>really</em> written like a couple in an old-time sitcom sometimes.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10">Ben 10</a></em> had a lot of this between cousins Ben and Gwen, who were written almost exactly like the writers were setting up a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension">Belligerent Sexual Tension</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppyLove">Puppy Love</a> thing. Scenes like the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOnApproach" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandsOnApproach">slow dance lesson</a> didn't do anything to dissuade this opinion. This most likely stems from how Ben and Gwen were originally meant to be friends and classmates instead of cousins. It is often rumored that the reason they were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangledByTheRedString">Strangled by the Red String</a> in the later series was because the writers wanted people to stop pairing them, not that it worked too well with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipWritingFumble">Relationship Writing Fumble</a>.
</li><li> In an early episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball">The Amazing World of Gumball</a></em>, Darwin develops a massive crush on his adoptive brother Gumball <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractiveBentGender">in his mom's wedding dress</a> without realizing it's him. Much later, Teri questions Darwin over who he's kissed, and when she finds out through a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FullyAutomaticClipShow">Fully Automatic Clip Show</a> that he's kissed Gumball five times (including the aforementioned "The Dress"), she questions "what's up with you guys?"
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad">American Dad!</a></em> has this with virtually every member of the Smith household.
<ul><li> Steve and Hayley. At one point, Steve had unknowingly purchased a naked picture of Hayley and masturbated to its image several times before being alerted to who it was. Then there's the episode where Roger convinced Steve that he was adopted. One of the first things he did was <em>kiss Hayley</em> saying that "we've been waiting to do for years".
</li><li> Stan has, on multiple occasions, mentioned that he doesn't mind if Steve or Hayley engage in both mildly and highly flirtatious acts with him because "he's their dad". These include allowing them to squeeze his glutes as he flexes his muscles, allowing Steve to look at his groin while he is wearing well fitting underwear, etc.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Stan</strong>: Go ahead, kids, give 'em a squeeze! It's not weird, I'm your dad.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Stan</strong>: I'll go get help, and you guys can look at my ass as I walk away. I think you'll be pleased.
</div><ul><li> Hayley enters a relationship with Stan's CIA body double and doesn't at all seem disturbed that he looks exactly like her father (but does mention at one point that she gets "freaked out" when he talks like him), and naturally Stan isn't disturbed at all when he finds out, believing him to be the best boyfriend Hayley's had. Ironically knowing her past choices (aka a constantly high hippie) he might be right.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy">Family Guy</a></em> contains several scenes in which Peter attempts to molest Meg, that is when she isn't occupying her position as the family <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>. Meg herself has a disturbing amount of scenes in which she and Chris engage in sexual acts. In "Halloween on Spooner Street", she and Chris kiss for the first time, and even though they are initially disgusted, several lines later in the series suggest that they may have continued this habit. At one point, Meg asks Chris if "he wants to continue practicing french kissing", and in one episode, she walks into his bedroom wearing a towel saying "Our bath is ready". Stewie has once shown interest in his grandfather, Carter Pewderschmit, in terms of wiping his buttocks after a trip to the bathroom. Chris, in addition to Meg, has shown interest in Lois. Peter at one point loses his memory, and believed it was fine to have sex with anyone, including his kids. Meg stated he'd done so before as a joke, but everyone took it too seriously because of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a> status.
</li><li> TJ from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WordGirl">WordGirl</a></em> has a crush-like obsession with the title character. He has no idea that it's his (albeit adopted) older sister, Becky.
</li><li> The fifth episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Superjail">Superjail!</a></em> had this exchange, though it's more likely a throwaway joke:
<div class="indent"><strong>Twin 1</strong>: Would you like to accompany me to the concert show tonight? <br/><strong>Twin 2</strong>: Are you asking me out on a date? <br/><strong>Twin 1</strong>: Maybe. <em>(this is followed by their creepy laughter)</em>
</div></li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeague">Justice League</a></em> episode "Metamorphosis" brings this out in <em>spades</em> for Simon Stagg and his daughter, Sapphire. When he shows up to her apartment, he's carrying flowers and checking his breath, as if he's a suitor. When he finds out she's engaged to Rex Mason, he tries to have him taken out of the picture entirely. And when a failed attempt to use the Metamorpho process results in his consciousness being transferred into a building-tall blob of slime, J'onn says that the creature is driven only by "pure desire" - and guess who he goes after first?
</li><li> The title character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em> seems to have this kind of relationship with his mother. He gets an erection at the thought of his mother dying and is claimed to yell out her name during sex, and that's just from the first episode. In "A Going Concern", when Malory is about to get married, Lana points out that he's upset because his mom's "leaving [him] for another man". And this exchange from first season episode "Killing Utne":
<div class="indent"><strong>Malory</strong>: <em>(about a bell)</em> Oh, that's right. I kept it on the nightstand to wake nanny whenever Sterling wet the bed. <br/><strong>Cheryl</strong>: Wait, whose bed? <br/><strong>Woodhouse</strong>: It was always "don't ask, don't tell."
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Twilight stated (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatRemindsMeOfASong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatRemindsMeOfASong">in song</a>) that her brother, Shining Armor, was her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyFriend">Only Friend</a> prior to the show (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RememberTheNewGuy">even though he's introduced in the finale of Season 2</a>), and that they were very close. As such, her extremely negative reaction upon learning of her brother's marriage (via a letter she received a day or two <em>prior</em> to the wedding) and her ensuing scrutiny and harsh criticism of the bride-to-be are very easy to interpret as <em>jealousy</em>.
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Applejack:</strong> Think maybe you're being just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
</div><ul><li> Also, during the reprise of "Big Brother Best Friend Forever", Twilight creates figments of herself and Shining Armor that look suspiciously like the figures of Shining Armor and Cadence that go on the wedding cake.
</li><li> It's mostly said jokingly, but when you have Applejack and Big Macintosh as the parental figures to their little sister, tongues will wag. Nobody, even fans of the 'ship, took it seriously until "Where the Apple Lies," which depicts the parents already gone - AJ and Mac are arguing over who will take over the farm from Granny Smith, meaning there's no one in the middle - but no evidence of Apple Bloom's existence yet. Cue a bit of <em>OMG we were just kidding don't tell me she's really their kid!</em> the day that episode aired.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MayaAndMiguel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MayaAndMiguel">Maya &amp; Miguel</a></em>, a PBS Kids cartoon about two bilingual Latino twins and their diverse group of friends, the titular twins Maya and Miguel are often portrayed as very, very close. Of course, they can't be more then ten, but they hold hands and kiss one another on the cheek, which is as much as any of the married couples on the show do. One obvious episode is 'La Neuva Cocinita'. The intro is a voiceover with Maya talking about how she and her brother are like yin and yang and they perfectly balance one another. Later, in a flashback from Abuela Elena, she remembers when she and her husband ran a restaurant together and there is a black and white sequence of Elena and her husband running the restaurant. Later, when Maya and Miguel are running a restaurant in imitiation of their grandparents, the montage of the twins is completely identical to the flashback from Elena and her husband  down to Maya kissing Miguel on the cheek.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/IronManArmoredAdventures">Iron Man: Armored Adventures</a></em>, Rhona and Andy Edwin's relationship seems rather close for siblings, with Andy being fanatically devoted to serving his sister. To be fair, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Andy's actually a robot that Rhona created.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Accidental on the part of the Ice King, who tries kissing Marceline after she tells him that she likes having him around. This startles her, since before the crown that the Ice King wears completely drove him to madness, he acted as a surrogate father to her in the years following the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt">Mushroom War</a>, but he's essentially become too senile to remember what their relationship was like.</span>
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim">Invader Zim</a></em> episode "Bolognius Maximus" where Dib's DNA was slowly being turned into bologna, he tastes himself and later asks his sister Gaz to taste him, saying that he's "delicious". Gaz slowly backs away.
</li><li> Even when they were enemies, Karai and Leo from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2012">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012)</a></em> have a habit of flirting with one another. However, Karai is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the biological daughter of Hamato Yoshi, the man who would later become Master Splinter</span>. Leonardo's anthropomorphic features are due to the mutagen mutating him with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Splinter's human DNA, thus making him his son</span>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When you think about it, that makes Karai Leo's <em>half-sibling</em>!</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MartinMystery" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MartinMystery">Martin Mystery</a></em> has multiple moments of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipTease">Ship Tease</a> between step-siblings Martin and Diana. This is only made worse when one knows the original comic, where they were never step-siblings and instead dated for years and eventually <em>married</em>.
