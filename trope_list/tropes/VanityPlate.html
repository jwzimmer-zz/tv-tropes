They can occur at the beginning, which is usually done in movies to the opening beats of the theme music or to its own theme. Rising production costs have increased the number of collaborative efforts between studios in recent years, which has the unfortunate side-effect of multiplying the number of vanity plates that open a film.
</p><p>Some companies put a great deal of effort into creating a memorable vanity plate, as this is really the only advertising the production company receives.

<ul><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TwentiethCenturyStudios">20th Century Fox/20th Century Studios</a></strong>: Formed in 1935 from the merger of <strong>20th Century</strong> Pictures and <strong>Fox</strong> Film, its famous "logo statue" with moving searchlights was first used by 20th Century Pictures in 1933 and amended in 1935 to work Fox's name in. The famous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlfredNewman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlfredNewman">Alfred Newman</a> fanfare was there from the start, albeit in a shorter version than we're used to today; the better-known long version was first used in 1953 to allow for a card announcing "A Cinemascope Picture" after the logo for films in that format. After Cinemascope's demise in 1967, the long version was resurrected by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> in 1977 with the second half playing over the Lucasfilm logo, and the short and long versions would alternate during the 1980s until the long version won out in the 1990s. The first major overhaul of the logo came in 1994, when it became an aerial pan over the now-CGI "statue", though the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels kept the old static format with the new CGI "statue" for the Lucasfilm logo combo. The CGI "statue" was updated in 2009; a variant used that year only ends with the camera panning up to show the words "Celebrating 75 Years". The 2009 logo was modified in 2020, due to the studio changing its name to 20th Century Studios <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisneyOwnsThisTrope">after being bought by The Walt Disney Company</a>.
<ul><li> Their home video label, <strong>20th Century Fox Home Entertainment</strong>, features <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3krLW9Pl5HM">a different version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> where the camera pans over to the right to reveal "Home Entertainment" on the right side of the tower.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>20th Television</strong>: Established in 1955 as "TCF Television Productions", it used a TCF "statue" similar in style to the movie studio's logo until it became "20th Century Fox Television" in 1959. That year, the logo switched to the standard movie logo, except with "TELEVISION" suddenly appearing midway through and zooming out over "CENTURY" on the "statue". "20th Television" was established as a syndication arm in 1989; in 1992, a new logo was introduced for both TV divisions which featured the "20th Television" name, inspired by how the previous logo's end result would read "20th Television Fox". In 1995, the TV production divison got a separate logo again, with a "statue" that reads "20th Century Fox Television" in full. Two main fanfares have been used: one that kinda-but-not-really sounds like the Fox fanfare and one that sounds closer to an excerpt of the Fox fanfare. The first was used from the 1960s to the late 1980s, when the second one took over; starting from the late 1990s, both divisions have used various rearrangements of both fanfares. With the Disney buyout in 2020, the TV production division began using once again the "20th Television" name and the syndication arm was folded into Disney Media Distribution. The 20th Television logo has a hatedom similar to the Sony Pictures Television logo for being plastered over older 20th Century Fox Television and MTM Entreprises logos.
<ul><li> <strong>20th Century Fox Television Distribution</strong>, an apparently short-lived (2013-16) division, features <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3kPr43UbQI">a logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> whose disturbingly tall tower and overall cheapness makes it look more like a "fake logo" made up by some rando on the Internet than an actual professionally-made logo.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Acme Productions</strong>: Mindy Schultheis' production company. Their only logo contains an old-looking brown TV underneath a giant wrecking ball that says "ACME PRODUCTIONS" above it on a blue background with three red oblong shapes. The wrecking ball falls on the TV smashing it as a cartoony voice sings "Ac-meeee" followed by a cough.
</li><li> <strong>Adam F. Goldberg Productions</strong>: The producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingIn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingIn">Breaking In</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoldbergs">The Goldbergs</a></em>; various childhood pictures of producer Adam F. Goldberg (and his family) would be shown. <em>The Goldbergs</em> episode, "12 Tapes for a Penny", <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogoJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogoJoke">was credited to "Doug Fell Productions"</a>, presumably to keep in line with the episode's theme of using fake names.
</li><li> <strong>Air Programs International</strong>: This obscure Australian animation studio is notorious for <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VElH_YCUR7E">their animated logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (epilepsy warning) featuring a rather crudely animated "spinning vortex" and the API letters zooming into place as the camera zooms in and out, all in time to a deranged synth-and-tympani fanfare. Some see it as the Aussie answer to the "S from Hell", others find the vortex's resemblance to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Beyblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Beyblade">Beyblade</a> or a fidget spinner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">Hilarious in Hindsight</a>.

The company logo, a caricatured Danny Antonucci (company founder) being skewered by a pencil, accompanied by a generic car-crash sound and a saxophone riff. The logo is remarkably different in every season, special (excluding the Cartoon Network Invaded special) and even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMovie">The Movie</a> of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a>.

Originally, the letters in Amblin slid in from the right, but this logo got a revamping that has the camera zoom out from the moon as Elliott rides over it. This still has the letters in Amblin sliding in, but the bars above and below it now slide in as well.
</li><li> The <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amblimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Amblimation">Amblimation</a></strong> logo features <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail">Fievel</a> pushing the logo.

LUTELY!", while the word is printed beneath in pink. The man is actually Tim's dad, and he was responding to the request "Sum up this vacation in 2 words".

<ul><li> There were a number of early versions. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatACartoonShow">What A Cartoon! Show</a></em> used the studio's first logo on a colored background with information about studio ownership underneath, accompanied with the sound effects of the 1990s Hanna-Barbera Studios logo. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a></em> had two variants using a second logo: one that had Dexter crash through the logo inside a robot, and a second where Dee Dee spun the "O"'s in the logo before Dexter crashed through. A small number of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pilot">pilots</a> in 2001 and 2006 used a horizontal variant of the third logo, with the Cartoon Network Studios building depicted above it.
</li><li> Starting from 2001, the studio's main vanity plate consists of the third logo opening up into a rectangular box to showcase a pencil test animation of the characters from the preceding show performing some action, the top being the text lines for "Cartoon Network", and the bottom being "Studios". At the end of the animation, the box collapses, sometimes as a result of the characters' actions. The vanity plate is played with "swooshing" sounds for the opening and closing, with additional sound effects, music and dialogue being added depending on the production. This vanity plate was briefly retired in 2010, before resurfacing in 2013 using a fifth logo that is a "cleaner" version of the third, with a number of productions using a clip from an episode instead of an original piece of animation.

</li></ul></li><li> From 2010-2013, the studio briefly used a fourth logo consisting of four white blocks appearing to the tune of the channel's then on-air jingle. Three blocks would stack diagonally, while the fourth one would fall off to the bottom right, with most productions briefly showing a clip from the preceding show within that last block. The words "Cartoon Network Studios" were written under it. Most of the vanity plates for the studio's numerous productions can be viewed <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIFJpucg1YA">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

<ul><li> From January 4, 1999 to November 10, 2016, the network's main production logo was the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonCartoons">Cartoon Cartoons</a></em> Ripple logo. It featured the 1992-2004 Cartoon Network logo at the middle of the screen, with a parent company byline displayed below ("A Time Warner Company" from 1999-2001 and 2003-2016; "An AOL Time Warner Company" from 2001-2003). Between the logo is the Service Mark (SM) from 1999-late 2014 and Trade Mark (TM) symbol from late 2014-2016. The blue circles appear behind the logo while the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonCartoons">Cartoon Cartoons</a></em> music plays, which will stop once the jingle finishes. It takes place on a black background, with a few exceptions, such as Dreamworks Dragons: Riders of Berks in which it plays music from the credits, logo's colors are inverted, taking place on a map background, and all of its text is black.
</li><li> Since November 10, 2016, the network's main production logo is the Exploding Blocks logo. On a blue background, a black square appears at the left and the white one at the right. When they collide, the letters C and N will appear on their respective squares. An explosion graphic effect appears, resulting in revealing the black and white 7x2 square grid. The company's name will appear on it and morphs into the 2010 version of Cartoon Network checkerboard logo. The background color, however, will change from blue to white while the morphing animation plays. Its background music is the retro 4 note of the 2010 CN jingle. Unlike the 1999-2016 Ripple logo, the parent company byline and Trade Mark/Service Mark symbol do not appear below and between the logo, respectively. It was first introduced on a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow">Regular Show</a></em> episode <em>The Key to the Universe</em>.

<ul><li> A black ball of fuzz bounces across a rectangle to music, lighting up each part to reveal the 1992-2004 Cartoon Network logo, taking an extra jump to get the last part, and smiling as the words "Development Studio Europe" pop up on the bottom. The name shown on-screen is Cartoon Network Development Studio Europe which was the official name of the animation studio from 2007 to 2017.
</li><li> On <em>The Heroic Quest of the Valiant Prince Ivandoe</em>, the logo is the same as its US counterpart, but has the word "Europe" located between "Studios". This logo also adapts a new name for the animation studio.

With its first standard animated logo in 1978, three orange rectangles appeared on the screen which stretched out to form the letters "ctw" followed by the text "Children's Television Workshop" appearing above the T and W. This is accompanies by spacey sounding music. With its more well-known logo introduced in 1983, a white spark flies in three rows across the screen forming the words "CHILDREN'S TELEVISION WORKSHOP" followed by one last spark flying up from the lower left corner and then exploding in the center of the screen. By 1999 the company changed their name to Sesame Workshop.

Viewers had to tape the show and pause the plate to read Lorre's latest humorous discussion of his beliefs and observations. At first the plate was white text on black, but it was changed to black text on white because it was easier to read. Eventually Lorre came up with a standard placeholder message (which pretty much described itself as a placeholder message) for the times when he was running low on material. <a class="urllink" href="http://www.chucklorre.com/">All of Lorre's Vanity Plates can be seen on his website<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaPictures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaPictures">Columbia Pictures</a></strong>: Following its 1924 reorganization from "CBC Film Sales", a logo featuring the goddess of Liberty (a female Roman soldier holding a shield and a grain of wheat) was introduced. The arrival of talkies in 1928 saw <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpIEeoDVtT0">the debut<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the famous "Torch Lady", a representation of Columbia (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnthropomorphicPersonification">Anthropomorphic Personification</a> of America) holding a torch similar to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/StatueOfLiberty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Art/StatueOfLiberty">Statue of Liberty</a>; it was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGp_PqjrKDk">revised<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1936 and then left unchanged for 40 years outside of minor changes like the lady's American flag draping becoming a plain one in 1942 due to the United States Flag Code forbidding the use of it as clothing. 1976 saw Columbia, like many studios, try out a new stylized logo with the "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t04eWLp6_Bk">Abstract Torch<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>", which starts out with the classic "Torch Lady" and ends with a blue abstract sunburst shape created through backlit cel animation and rostrum camera tricks. Coca-Cola's acquisition of Columbia in 1982 saw the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9M9HsoyzT4">return<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the classic "Torch Lady", using the first part of the "Abstract Torch" logo without the zoom-in. The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejCcaGOUG40">current<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> "Torch Lady" logo that debuted in 1993 begins with a zoom out from the torch and ends with a result that looks like an update of the 1936-76 version. Many actresses have been claimed to be featured as the "Torch Lady", including Claudia Dell, Evelyn Venable, Jane Bartholomew and Amelia Bacheler; Jenny Joseph was used as the basis of Michael Deas' painting used in the current version (which was once rumored to feature Annette Benning). <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superbad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Superbad">Superbad</a></em> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqUbiXS4CV4">resurrected<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> the 1976-82 "Abstract Torch", albeit with a Sony byline added to the beginning and the background turning to yellow at the end to fit with the opening credits.
</li><li> <strong>Columbia-TriStar Television</strong>:
<ul><li> Following the reincorporation of Screen Gems Television as Columbia Pictures Television in 1974, a new logo was quickly created to replace the "S from Hell". Dubbed "The Pretzel", it featured on a red background the yellow letters "C P T" appearing one by one then fusing into a pretzel-like shape, all in time to the "three notes, two arpeggios" edit of the "S from Hell" fanfare used since 1970.
</li><li> The second part of the "Abstract Torch" movie logo was used during the same era for the TV division, albeit with the blue shape being orange instead (it sometimes looks red depending of the print quality). This logo is notorious in the CLG Wiki community for being the subject of a long-standing rumor that a variant featuring a Coca-Cola byline was out there somewhere (the Coke buyout happened within the last few months of the logo's life); video evidence seemingly turned up in 2015, but was later debunked as being faked.
</li><li> The 1982 and 1993 "Torch Ladies" were also used simultaneously on TV; the 1993 version, being simply a still of the Michael Deas painting, actually debuted a year earlier on television. The same applied for TriStar Television, which used the 1984 and 1993 versions of its "Pegasus" logo, the latter also debuting a year early on TV.
</li><li> The merger of Columbia and TriStar's TV divisions into Columbia-TriStar Television in 1994 led to the "Boxes of Boredom" (two boxes with the left one containing the "Torch Lady" and the right one the "Pegasus"), notorious for plastering older Screen Gems/Columbia logos, though Columbia and TriStar's individual logos kept being used until 2001 and 1999 respectively. The "Boxes" themselves were retired in 2003 when the company became Sony Pictures Television and their "Bars of Boredom" took over plastering duties.

In 1966, the "Merging Circles" plate debuted: to the sound of a majestic horn fanfare, six pink and red circles surrounding a white circle appear, which then merge into a blue circle and zoom out as the yellow "Desilu" script writes itself in, the blue circle becoming a white dot over the "i". The company was bought by Gulf+Western in 1967 and became Paramount Television in 1968; the "Merging Circles" fanfare was carried over for its first placeholder logo.

<ul><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InspectorGadget">Inspector Gadget</a></em>, it would show Gadget skating by the logo on a blue background (sans the dot on the I); he'd stumble, and the gadget mallet would pop out of his hat and slam into the wall behind him as he flailed away, with the impact of the mallet becoming the dot on the I.
</li><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLittles">The Littles</a></em>, it would show Dinky running by the logo and dotting the I with a button before stumbling off the screen. This version used an orange background, but on the French version the background was red.
</li></ul></li><li> Their most famous signoff is popularly known as "The Kid in Bed." Used from 1987-2001, this animated logo starts with a kid and his dog sleeping in a bed and then transitions to a starry sky in which the logo appears with a bright shining star transitioning to the dot in the I. The music was different in many versions of the logo.
</li><li> For DiC Toon-Time Video, a home video labeled operated in conjunction with Buena Vista Home Video/Walt Disney Home Video in the 90's, a different <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate">Vanity Plate</a> appeared prior to the feature program on each video. This one has a funky-shaped TV swaying back and forth as it moves back onto a back cartoonish plaque, and once it's there, you can hear the knob on the TV clicking and a flash from the TV emits, after which the Toon-Time Video logo appears below it. This <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VanityPlate">Vanity Plate</a> uses the same music as "The Kid in Bed" signoff.
</li><li> The acronym of the company was pronounced as in French; i.e., "deek". Sure to get a "hunh?" from monolingual English-speakers. It was also a shout out to DiC co-founder Andy Heyward's father, Louis "Deke" Heyward, who himself worked in the television business as vice president in charge of development for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackBarry">Barry &amp; Enright</a> Productions.

This vanity plate was a variant of the 1990 "Walt Disney Pictures" logo featuring Cinderella's castle.

In 2015, the studio's received a new vanity plate that uses a unique logo which depicts have Mickey Mouse (the character's design from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse2013">2013 TV series</a>) in a walking pose alongside the studio name.

</li><li> When the studio was bought out by Universal, a new version of the logo was made to accompany it starting with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragonTheHiddenWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HowToTrainYourDragonTheHiddenWorld">How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</a></em>.

<ul><li> Several different signoffs were used. The best-known of these, used between 1961 and 1978, features a horizontally-stretched globe against a starfield, with "A Filmways Television Presentation" paralleling the top and bottom of the globe. A voiceover stating "This has been a Filmways presentation" usually accompanied the logo, spoken by one of the stars of the show that preceded it. The most famous examples came from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBeverlyHillbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBeverlyHillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></em>, spoken by Donna Douglas as Elly May, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreenAcres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GreenAcres">Green Acres</a></em> with Eva Gabor saying: "This has been a Filmways presentation, dahling."
</li><li> Filmways switched to a haunting bell toll around 1978, with the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E03mfXfA6sM">Filmways logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and several shadow copies appearing from the bottom of the screen.

</li><li> Later episodes of <em>Adventure Time</em> had the same robot's head being built out of Lego with the hammering sounds playing in the background. The "FREDERATOR!" yell is heard after the head is complete.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> Entertainment</strong>:
<ul><li> The original vanity plate featured the different shapes of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> logo (a star, a rectangle, and a circle) slowly falling into place, creating the logo. This was only seen in the 1994 release of the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> movie. It was replaced afterwords with a new vanity featuring the different shapes moving on their own (including the rectangle jiggling into place), before the shapes were properly arranged, creating the logo. Both of these vanities used the same music and sound effects, and lasted about 10 seconds each.
</li><li> A new vanity (arguably the one fans are most familiar with) was introduced in about 1998, and was only about 3 seconds long. It featured all the different shapes quickly flying into place. It was used on all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FUNimation">Funimation</a> video releases, and after every showing of Dragon Ball Z.
</li><li> A new one was used beginning in around 2004. It had a static FUNimation logo sitting in place behind bubbles (also bearing the logo) while a voice from behind whispered "FUNimation" against the sounds of children laughing.
</li><li> This one was replaced with a new one in 2006 with a slightly different logo (The words "FUNimation", and the ball and star within a big blue rectangle) flying into place against a black background while a whispering voice said "FUNimation", before a light flashed, and the logo disappeared (some uses cut this part out). Another version of this vanity was used in around 2008, and featured modified graphics.
</li><li> Another vanity was introduced in 2009, and featured a white background while the FUNimation logo was quickly drawn (with audible pencil strokes) while paint slowly filled the logo with its proper colors. A man and a woman's voices are heard saying "FUNimation", while the logo disappeared and another voice (presumably <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherSabat">Christopher Sabat</a>) whispered the text "You Should Be Watching". An abbreviated version of this vanity was used for TV broadcasts.
</li><li> The 2012 vanity uses different approach. It drops the shapes altogether, and features the FUNimation logo against a quickly changing background representing different genres of anime (with a very "modern" flair). It ends with the logo sitting static against a plain white background.
</li><li> For <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">the company's 20th anniversary</a> in 2014, a brief animation reel of common anime sfx plays, including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> style clashes, blosoms floating away, and energy surges. It also briefly brings back the shapes by styling them into a blue and red "20", the 0 serving as the circle with the star in it before turning into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">one star Dragon Ball</a>. After the anniversary logo turns purple, it quickly disappears in a flash of light, while the normal Funimation logo gets sliced and falls off the screen.
</li><li> The 2016 logo drops the old font and white background, but keeps the 2012 plate theme. After showing off a circle that changes contents based on genre when it flips, a minimalist smiley face flips into view and makes "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLowercaseLetters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLowercaseLetters">funimation</a>" appear around the face with several items floating away. The background was also changed to purple. A shorter version of this plate was used for their DVD and online output.

In an attempt to protect his films from being illegally copied, he often put the trademark somewhere on the film set in an important scene in the film, so that it would be considerably harder for film pirates to hide where they had stolen it from.
</li><li> <strong>Gracie Films</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesLBrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesLBrooks">James L.

Set in a movie theater, the logo starts with the audience (in silhouette) talking before a lady shushes them and the company name appears on the screen to a jingle composed by Jeffrey Townsend on a KORG 05R/W (thought by some to be based on Go West's hit "The King of Wishful Thinking", but the logo actually came first). The audience sound was provided by Townsend and then-Fox CEO Garth Anchier double-tracking themselves to sound like more people and the "shush" was provided by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TraceyUllman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TraceyUllman">Tracey Ullman</a>, whose <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTraceyUllmanShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheTraceyUllmanShow">eponymous show</a> was the first to use the logo.

The latter featured several audio variations over the years, such as the Treehouse of Horror episodes replacing the "shush" with a scream and the jingle being done in a minor key on a pipe organ or "The Old Man and the Key" having Lisa imitate the Filmways sign-off on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBeverlyHillbillies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBeverlyHillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></em> by saying "This has been a Gracie Films pray-sen-tay-shun"; several more are listed <a class="urllink" href="http://www.simpsonsarchive.com/guides/altcredits.html">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> under "Alternate Gracie Films Logos".

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HannaBarbera">Hanna-Barbera</a></strong>:
<ul><li> Their first proper closing logo, "The HB Box" came about when Taft Broadcasting purchased the studio in 1967, consisting of a huge blocky "HB" over which "a hanna-barbera production" appears. Three distinct variants exist. The first, used in <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em> (1967) and <em>The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (1968-69), has orange rectangles stretching over a black background to form a black "HB", which zooms out over the now-orange background, followed by the text appearing and a yellow or orange "HB" fading in behind, all accompanied by a frantic jingle. The second and most famous one, used 1968-74, has an orange "HB" zooming in over a black background, then the background cutting to orange as the text appears, accompanined by a flute/organ glissando. The third one, used 1969-71, reuses the first variant's stretching rectangles idea, but instead of zooming out, the "HB" turns to blue; this also uses the glissando jingle.
</li><li> This was followed by the "Rainbow HB" used from 1974-79, which begins with columns of "HANNA-BARBERA" text in rainbow colors which all disappear except one, which morphs into a stylized "HB" with a scrolling pattern of rainbow colors with columns of "HANNA-BARBERA" text. If you look closely at the background of the title cards and end credits for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheScoobyDooShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheScoobyDooShow">The Scooby-Doo Show</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DynomuttDogWonder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DynomuttDogWonder">Dynomutt, Dog Wonder</a></em>, you'll notice it's made up using the same stylized "HB" logo.
</li><li> 1979 saw the introduction of the famous "Swirling Star" logo designed by Saul Bass, basically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpectacularSpinning">Spectacular Spinning</a>: The Vanity Plate. A white star spins into view leaving a rainbow trail behind, then stops in the middle with its trail forming a neat circle; futuristic synthesized music accompanies the action. It was redesigned in 1986 with CGI with a metallic star and a shinier, looser trail which produced a less symmetric end result. It was last used generally in 1992, but it accidentally appeared on an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyBravo">Johnny Bravo</a></em> in 1997 and was revived for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePowerpuffGirls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></em> in 1998, then replaced by the Cartoon Network pencil test when H-B closed for good and production moved to CN's Burbank studios. The "Swirling Star" design was also used as a logo for Taft Entertainment Pictures from 1981-87.
</li><li> In the early '90s, they dropped the Star altogether (at least in Vanity Plate form) after the studio's purchase by Turner Broadcasting. It was replaced by a script "Hanna-Barbera" (introduced in 1988), which was combined with pictures of H-B characters in a rectangle (or an oval on <em>Swat Kats</em> and <em>The Halloween Tree</em>) (usually the ones from the preceding show), along with H-B sound effects in the background. They took this a step further in 1994, with CG animated logos with Hanna-Barbera characters in motion. There were two versions, comedy and action, the latter best known for its accidental presence at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooWhereAreYou">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!</a></em>'s mid-'90s prints. When Hanna-Barbera was wound down to little more than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a>'s original programming unit in the late '90s, the early '90s static logos were revisited, except with ovals instead of rectangles (on some shows, rectangles were used instead of ovals). There are versions of these where the logo irises out and the Cartoon Network logo zooms up in its place.
</li><li> For the shows made in the 1990 season (<em>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures, Rick Moranis In Gravedale High</em> <em>Wake, Rattle &amp; Roll</em>, <em>Tom and Jerry Kids</em>, and <em>Yo Yogi!</em>), a special ending vanity plate with Fred Flintstone was used to denote the 30th anniversary of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones">The Flintstones</a>.</em>
</li><li> Despite the demise of Hanna-Barbera as a standalone studio, properties associated with the company still use the name and have even resurrected past logos. Movies in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooDirectToVideoFilmSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScoobyDooDirectToVideoFilmSeries">Scooby-Doo Direct-to-Video Film Series</a></em> produced from 2003-2009 featured an HD remake of the second variant of the "HB Box" logo. A new logo introduced in 2017 is basically an HD remake of the "Rainbow HB" logo, albeit with a different design for the "HB".
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Harpo Studios</strong> is the company formed by television personality and entrepreneur <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OprahWinfrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OprahWinfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, which is her first name spelled backwards. In the first version of the logo, which debuted in 1986, a cartoon version of Oprah wearing a lavender jacket and a yellow shirt pulls in a wagon with the text "HARPO PRODUCTIONS INC." with the "O" in "HARPO" slanted and "PRODUCTIONS INC." appearing below it. She stops and the wagon bumps into her shaking the word "HARPO" and she takes a bow afterwards. The logo was accompanied by an 11-note violin fanfare.

<ul><li> The first logo has "IMAGINE" rising from the centre of the screen as if from a body of water with accompanying reflection, and "AN" above the "IMAGINE" and "ENTERTRAINMENT PRESENTATION" (or "FILMS ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTATION") below the reflection. (Another variation simply "ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS" beneath.)
</li><li> The second logo, first seen at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNuttyProfessor1996" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNuttyProfessor1996">The Nutty Professor (1996)</a></em>, shows a drop of water falling into a pond with a reflection of the word "IMAGINE" appearing to a theme composed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesHorner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JamesHorner">James Horner</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>ITC Entertainment</strong> went through four iterations featuring modifications of its "stacked diamonds" logo:
<ul><li> The first iteration zoomed in on a compass rose, flipped it over to reveal a sinusoidal projection map of the world, which then zoomed out and duplicated to form three stacked "diamonds", with the letters I, T, and C, from top to bottom, inside.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC0Uv5izk2Q">second version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> featured spinning "flowers" (or pinwheels), from which the diamond-shaped "petals" would spin off and rearrange themselves until they became the ITC logo, which was revised to add depth. A different theme was used for this version. This version served as the ident for ITC Film Distributors only.
</li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48xCAFAVpCo">third version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> had the ITC logo (in white) zoom in from the center of a spinning object composed of the logo's diamond shapes, one each in red, green, and blue, on a space background. The first version's theme was used. This version is familiar to those of us who grew up with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow">The Muppet Show</a></em>.
</li><li> The final version had the letters ITC, rendered in gold, slide into place on a back background one at a time from behind a revised stacked-diamond logo that spun in place until the C stopped. The music was simplified, reduced to a short synthesized piece ending with a "CLANG!".

<ul><li> The logo originally showed a goofy animated donkey situated in the "O" of the title and yelling "hee haw!" but later version played a few notes from "La Cucaracha" as the donkey jumped down into the crook of the "J" and yelled "Yokozuna!" In a later season of <em>The Man Show</em>, Jimmy and Adam introduced an idea concocted by one of their friends: sitting on the face of a sleeping buddy, giving him the rudest of awakenings. The friend who did that screamed "Yokozuna!" as he made the face-plant, thus coining the name.
</li><li> In closing for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JimmyKimmelLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JimmyKimmelLive">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a></em>, the donkey was branded on the butt, causing it to jump into the O before falling with the letter around his neck, then it brays.

</li><li> After Don Simpson's death from drug-related heart failure, the company was renamed to <strong>Jerry Bruckheimer Films</strong>, we speed down a deserted road in a remote part of Oregon with thunderstorm clouds brewing above. As the camera encounters a leafless tree on the side of the road, lightning strikes it, forming leaves on it, as the footage freezes and zooms out in a box, revealing the company name.

This was replaced by one of Kermit operating a movie camera (with the logo on the side), which zoomed out on a camera platform. Then the platform slammed to a halt and Animal's voice said "Sorry!" Sadly, they can't use these any more because the Muppets are now Disney properties. They currently show a robot spider chasing a dragonfly for their children's productions and a revival of the old Henson Associates "ha!" logo for their adult ones.
</li><li> <strong>John Charles Walters Company</strong>: Founded by former MTM writers, this company's only product of note was the sitcom <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Taxi">Taxi</a></em>.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlaskyCsupo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KlaskyCsupo">Klasky-Csupo</a></strong> actually had three plates:
<ul><li> One in use from 1991-1998, which had various objects forming the letters in "KLASKY" and scribbles writing in "CSUPO". It was retired as of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRugratsMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRugratsMovie">The Rugrats Movie</a></em> for a new vanity plate. Another one made its only appearances on <em>Rugrats Go Wild</em> and <em>The Immigrants</em>: a city skyline with a green sky has a rooster who wakes up, screaming "WAKE... UP!!!", before the Sun gets brighter and brings forth the Klasky-Csupo logo (it looks different than it does in the other logos; it's an off-kilter print version which dates to at least 1999).
</li><li> The new vanity plate was rather surreal. Ink splattered on the screen, revealing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace">Nightmare Face</a> saying the company name and having the logo blocks shoot out of its mouth, then that sequence switches off like a TV and we see the Klasky-Csupo logo with an assortment of cartoon sounds in the background.

</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/COPS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/COPS">Langley Productions</a></strong>: 3 variants exist: the first was the early '80s <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It5efcmEc24">Barbour/Langley<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> Logo which featured the names in hot pink sliding in from the sides of the screen with an accompanying tune that creeped many of us for years.

</li><li> <strong>Litton Entertainment</strong> is a syndication company that airs live-action educational programs across all of America's broadcast networks, rendering them the figure of blame for the end of Saturday Morning Cartoons in America. With its current logo, a spark flies across the screen from left to right, then flies closer to the screen, turns, and flies from right to left, revealing a dark cloudy/sunset background as well as the word "LITTON", which is tilted to the side a bit but turns around to face the viewer. "ENTERTAINMENT" fades in below, and the logo shines. The logo also calls out Litton's parent company Hearst Entertainment at the bottom.
</li><li> <strong>Little Airplane Productions</strong>: Josh Selig's company that created <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Oobi">Oobi</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WonderPets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WonderPets">Wonder Pets!</a></em>, among others.
<ul><li> The first logo shows a girl running on a bridge (taken from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet">Sesame Street</a></em> skit, "I'm A Little Airplane!") on a black background with the company name above and the URL adress below, as a girl says something along the lines of, "Little Airplane!" which differs depending on the show. A short variation with an animated butterfly exists.
</li><li> The current variant features a red emblem with a old fashioned plane inside bounce in with the company name in it, as the girl from before once again says, "Little Airplane!"

A cow has its head poking over a fence, with voice a saying "The cow says...", then a baby says "Moo!", then laughs. The cow's eye then rolls back into its head.
</li><li> <strong>Mark VII Limited:</strong> Jack Webb's company, made his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural">Police Procedural</a> shows such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Dragnet">Dragnet</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AdamTwelve">Adam-12</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency">Emergency!</a></em> (which was actually a Fire Department Procedural). The logo consisted of a pair of hands holding a hammer and chisel; the hammer strikes the chisel producing roman numeral VII, with logo showing <strong>Mark VII Limited</strong>. The hands were not Jack Webb's (as commonly believed), but those of Harold C. Nyby, Jack Webb's construction foreman. "Mark VII" doesn't mean anything: some sources claim Webb chose it because he liked the look of the Roman numerals, while one source claims it was made up over coffee one day.
<ul><li> The company's logo was parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons">The Simpsons</a></em> in the opening to "Treehouse of Horror XV", with the tentacles of Kang (or possibly Kodos) hammering "XV" on the screen. It was done to reflect the credits sequence for the made-up sitcom <em>Keepin' It Kodos</em>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WoodyWoodpecker">Woody Woodpecker</a></em> also did a parody in "Under the Counter Spy", where the man accidentally hits his thumb with the hammer and yells in pain, then lifts the chisel to reveal the ending card.

A shot of Captain America tossing his shield at the screen, taken from <em>The First Avenger</em>, transitions to scenes from the other MCU movies being projected on the sides of the logo until it is fully revealed. Because new heroes are continuously added with each film, the logo clips are refreshed for each new Marvel Studios release to include recent additions; since the debut of the current plate, later iterations have added Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Gamora, Black Panther, &amp; Okoye in prominent positions. <em>Infinity War</em> and <em>Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp</em> also turn the backdrop black at the end and highlight the "I" and "O" in "Studios" to form a red "10" to mark the decade since the May 2008 release of <em>Iron Man</em>.
<ul><li> <em>Captain Marvel</em>, the first film the studio released after Stan Lee's death, turned the opening into a tribute to him by making all the clips be of his cameos and behind-the-scenes clips, until the final part thereof where the backdrop itself is like the one from the two movies that preceded it, sans the red highlights; this was later carried on in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AvengersEndgame">Avengers: Endgame</a></em> where, apart from being the movie with Lee's last cameo prior to his passing, the scenes and shots of the MCU characters snapped away in <em>Infinity War</em> are apparently left blank.

Mayer Pictures, its famous lion mascot was inherited from Goldwyn, who had been using it since 1916. When MGM began doing talkies, the lion acquired its equally famous roar. Several lions have taken turns inside the film ribbon circle; the most famous include Jackie (who appeared on black-and-white films from 1928 to 1956), Tanner (who appeared on color films from 1934 to 1956), and Leo (the current lion since 1957). Like many other studios, they tried out a stylized version but theirs was only used on two films in 1968: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSubjectWasRoses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheSubjectWasRoses">The Subject Was Roses</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwoThousandOneASpaceOdyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em> (though it was kept as a print logo until 1982 and reused for various other MGM ventures). Leo the Lion eventually got his own animated sitcom, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionhearts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLionhearts">The Lionhearts</a></em>.

Its logo is simply the company's name with a soothing guitar riff.
</li><li> <strong>Michael Sloan Productions</strong>: As seen on his various TV projects, the actual logos vary but they all have the same basic layout - a still picture of writer-producer Sloan posing with the star(s) of the show/TV movie (Lee Van Cleef for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaster">The Master</a></em>, Robert Vaughn and David McCallum for <em>The Return Of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUncle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheManFromUncle">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a></em>, etc), with "Michael Sloan Productions" written across the screen in Sloan's handwriting. Even the Canadian-produced episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlfredHitchcockPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AlfredHitchcockPresents">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</a></em> weren't immune, with Sloan posing in profile alongside the one of Hitch.

This is accompanied by a quick drum beat.
</li><li> <strong>MTM Productions/Enterprises:</strong> Company founded by Grant Tinker and Mary Tyler Moore (for whom it was named), it produced a vast outpouring of quality television, starting with the classic <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em>.
<ul><li> Its logo, well-known to several generations of TV viewers, was Mimsie the MTM kitten, a parody of Leo the MGM lion. In Mimsie's initial appearances at the end of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMaryTylerMooreShow">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></em> she simply meowed, but other MTM productions often added animated overlays and/or new sound tracks that were specific to the show.

<ul><li> The signoff is comprised of the words "Mutant Enemy" obviously hand-drawn in magic marker with a cardboard cut-out of a lurching zombie, also done in magic marker, crossing in front of it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s voice intones "Grrr... argh."
</li><li> The phrase "Mutant Enemy" comes from the song "And You And I" by Yes, and was the name Joss Whedon gave his first manual typewriter. The signoff itself was, according to Whedon, improvised at the last minute when he and his crew were told they needed one — hence its crude and simple appearance, which has only contributed to its popularity.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> also parodied this once when, after the regular Vanity Plate, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MutantEnemy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MutantEnemy">Mutant Enemy</a> zombie starts attacking various people, and then it pulled out to show it was just <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JossWhedon">Joss Whedon</a> screwing around.

<ul><li> In 1976 they changed their logo <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWrdHRGQmtk">to<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfjuLvVYz4o">a<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG3HhgBTxv8">big<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P1Co7PGrrw">"N"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> (which was promptly mocked by <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SaturdayNightLive">Saturday Night Live</a></em> - and also was the subject of a lawsuit by a Nebraska educational station, which received nearly a million dollars' worth of new equipment from NBC in compensation). By the time the Big N debuted, all network programming was in color, so the animated peacock opening was retired.
</li><li> In 1979, a simplified peacock was added to the Big N, forming the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUU2ljnS3wY">"Proud N"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> The three-note jingle, by the way, is "G-E-C" — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight">funny in hindsight</a>, since for a while they were owned by <strong>G</strong>eneral <strong>E</strong>lectric <strong>C</strong>orporation, although the chimes predate GE's ownership by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTelevision">nearly six decades</a>.
</li><li> The most famous version of the original animated peacock, featuring a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VE_oHJt_V5M">kaleidoscope-style animation<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is often referred to as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanNickname">Laramie Peacock</a>, as it was introduced with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWestern">Western</a> series <em>Laramie</em> after the show had made the switch to color.

</li><li> <strong>Oz Film Company</strong>: Co-founded by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LFrankBaum">L. Frank Baum</a>, this independent studio only produced five features and five short films in 1914-15 before folding; only four of the features partly survived, three of them being adaptations of Baum's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LandOfOz">Land of Oz</a></em> books. Its logo features the disembodied head of Vivian Reed dressed up as Princess Ozma, the "floating head" effect achieved by dressing Reed in a black dress and using a black background. Some films have Reed much closer to the camera and missing her loose curls, and due to the studio experimenting with color tinting its films, the logo exists in various colors tints beside monochrome. This is another logo which some have found scary due to Reed's stare and lack of music. <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3bjz9');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3bjz9" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3bjz9');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">(Soundtracks for silent movies were usually done live in the theater; the musicians may have provided musical accompaniment for the logo.)</span>
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount">Paramount</a> Pictures</strong>: A mountain surrounded by stars (usually 24, in reference to the number of big movie actors they had signed in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilentAgeOfHollywood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSilentAgeOfHollywood">The Silent Age of Hollywood</a>), also known as "Majestic Mountain" or "Paramountain". During the Gulf &amp; Western era, the mountain faded into a simplified dark-blue-and-white icon on a light blue background; this version of the logo was retired in 1987, replaced with an updated version of the "Majestic Mountain" which continued to be used following Viacom's acquisition of Paramount. The modern version usually features animated stars as they fly into the scene, complete with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidflightWaterTouching" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MidflightWaterTouching">Midflight Water Touching</a>, and take their place in formation around the mountain.
<ul><li> For <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTenCommandments">The Ten Commandments</a></em>, they substituted Mount Sinai in the logo.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Paramount">Paramount</a> Television:</strong>
<ul><li> While Paramount had its own TV network in 1949-56 (and infamously co-owned <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Dumont" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Dumont">Dumont</a>), it didn't get its own TV division until Gulf+Western bought out <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DesiluStudios" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DesiluStudios">Desilu Studios</a> in 1967 and renamed it Paramount Televison the next year. Its first logo, a placeholder which lasted 9 months, was a simplified black and white version of the "Majestic Mountain" over a blue background which recycled the fanfare from the Desilu "Merging Circles" logo.
</li><li> The next logo was the "Split Rectangle": over a yellow background is a blue rectangle split in two, the left-hand side having "Paramount Television" written in it and the right-hand side having the simplified "Majestic Mountain" in white and blue, which the camera zooms towards. The initial accompaniment was a majestic fanfare. In 1969, the yellow background became red and the mountain design was modified into the one eventually used for the movie studio and the next TV logo, albeit in white with a blue circle. The jingle was changed for a Dominic Frontiere theme nicknamed "Closet Killer" due to it being seen as more appropriate for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpScare">Jump Scare</a> scene than for a production logo jingle. (The vanity plate for Andy Daly Productions, co-producers of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Review" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Review">Review</a></em>, is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AffectionateParody">Affectionate Parody</a> of this logo.)
</li><li> In 1975, the simplified "Blue Mountain" logo used for movies was adapted for television by having "Television" slide under "Paramount". This one has two themes, one by Lalo Schifrin which was first used in 1970 to replace Frontiere's "Closet Killer" on the red "Split Rectangle" logo, and one by Jerry Goldsmith which debuted in 1977.
</li><li> By 1987, the television division began using still versions of the then-current movie logos accompanied by a reorchestration of the last few notes of "Paramount on Parade" which sounds suspiciously like the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em> theme. Following the 2005 Viacom-CBS split, Paramount Television merged with CBS Productions to become CBS Paramount Television (with logos featuring both the "CBS Eye" and the Paramount "Majestic Mountain"), which was renamed CBS Television Studios in 2009.
</li><li> In 2015, Viacom revived Paramount Television with a logo which is basically the tail end of the theatrical logo, except with "Television" written under "Paramount".

</li><li> <strong>Public TV For East Tennessee</strong>: Until the mid-1990s, the logo for WSJK (now WETP) was a stylized Two known as the "Ugly TWO" and the logo for WKOP was a 3-D number 15 known as the "'70s-style 15". The Ugly TWO was used as a station ID by itself in the late '80s as well as with the '70s-style 15 in the early to mid '90s. Both logos were used in the sign-on and sign-off screen until late 2002.

When Nickelodeon began to push the credits for its shows back the sound of a fly buzzing was added to the logo.

At the end of each film, the sequence is repeated, with the light snapping off or fading out after Luxo Jr. faces the camera.
</li><li> A variation comes after the closing credits of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE">Wall E</a></em>: after Luxo Jr. squashes the I and turns to the camera, its light bulb burns out. WALLE rolls into view, changes the bulb, pats Luxo Jr. on the "head", and starts to roll away. However, WALLE then knocks over the letter R in Pixar, and is forced to take its place by bending his body into the shape of an R.

<ul><li> Its first logo was a black planet with rings around it with "SABAN" on the rings in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PacMan">Pac-Man</a>-like lettering style, with "PRODUCTIONS" below that. Five lines are on the bottom left hand side of the planet.
</li><li> A new plate was adopted in 1988, which featured a white marble square with a round hole in it, with "SABAN" in the hole, and, depending on the version, "ENTERTAINMENT" or "INTERNATIONAL" below the hole. A gold plate spins in from the left of the screen while the square comes in from the right. The plate affixes itself into the hole, and three black lines draw themselves on the bottom left corner of the plate.
</li><li> The final Saban Entertainment plate, used from 1996 to 2002, features children in odd-looking clothing lying on the ground, which fades to show them holding a large, golden cloth, which fades to show them floating above an Earth globe with yellow water and red and green land, over a sky background. The children are holding balls of various colors, and golden light rushes around the globe until the globe and kids disappear, with the light forming a simplified version of the logo from 1988, with "SABAN" below it. This reveals that the clouds in the sky are being sucked into the center.

On the logo for his studio, a white oven against a green background opens up to reveal a lot of smoke and the text "Schneider's Bakery" in a retro-style orange font comes out.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScreenGems" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ScreenGems">Screen Gems</a></strong>:
<ul><li> The name, inspired by Columbia Pictures' 1920s slogan "Gems of the Screen", was first used for Columbia's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColumbiaCartoons">in-house animation unit</a> which started out as Charles Mintz's studio in 1929 and began using the Screen Gems name in 1933 after Columbia acquired a stake in it. Mintz sold his studio entirely to Columbia shortly before his death in 1939 and the name was kept until the studio was shut down in 1946 and Columbia began distributing UPA's cartoons instead. In that era, the Screen Gems name was only used on-screen in the copyright notices, with cartoons often opening and/or closing with an animated version of the Columbia Torch Lady.
</li><li> The name was then reused for Columbia's television division in 1948 as a way to distance it from its parent company, as most movie studios of the time saw television as a threat to their business and wanted nothing to do with it. Its first proper logo, a TV screen bearing the company name, debuted in 1952. Starting in 1955, Columbia began reducing its distance from its TV division by using the Torch Lady logo for Screen Gems with a byline stating that it was a division of Columbia. In 1963 debuted the "Dancing Sticks" logo, with colored sticks bouncing about and rainbow circles flashing to reveal "Screen Gems", all to a jazzy brass tune.
</li><li> The "Filmstrip S" logo, designed by Tom Geismar of Chermayeff &amp; Geismar, was first used by the TV division in 1965 in a logo which came to be known as the <a class="urllink" href="https://vimeo.com/18332484">"S from Hell"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Over an orange background, two red parallelograms come from the top and bottom and curl around a circular area in which a red dot appears, forming an "S" which looks like two spools of film merged together as "Screen Gems" zooms in below. The musical accompaniment, performed by Eric Siday on one of the very first Moog synthesizers, consists of six ascending "French horn" notes followed by two "trumpet" arpeggios; it was later shortened in 1970 to three notes and two arpeggios. The combination of the simple animation and strange music nonetheless proved very frightening to many viewers, especially children, some of whom have reported nightmares inspired by it; it became one of the most notorious "scary logos" alongside Viacom's "V of Doom" and even spawned <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM2AxGYn8jU">a mocumentary-horror style film entry for the Sundance Film Festival<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The TV division was renamed Columbia Pictures Television in 1974, but Siday's infamous jingle was retained for its first logo which was used until 1977.
</li><li> The name was resurrected yet again, alongside the "Filmstrip S", for a new specialty film division in 1999. Its first logo, seen <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_aiRTtPSRg">here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, acquired the "S from Heaven" nickname due to it being seen as much more calming than the old "S from Hell" (though some films use a red version which remind some of the "S from Hell"). Somebody at Sony must have taken notice, as a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVzWeLmktz0">second logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> debuted in 2011 featuring the logo floating above clouds, i.e. "in heaven".
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Snee-Oosh Inc.</strong> who developed <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em> among other shows. On their first logo from 1996, a totem pole bird surrounded by a yellow haze appears against a brown background with wooden letters of the company's appearing below. Shortly after Nickelodeon began pushing its credits to the side at the end of shows, the logo was accompanied by a chorus that sang the company's name followed by a strange flute-like whistle and an "ooh" sound that continued into Nickelodeon's logo afterward. It also appears in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> credits, but without the original logo music.
</li><li> <strong>Sony Pictures Television</strong>: Successor to Columbia-TriStar Television, which was infamous for its ubiquitous "Boxes of Boredom" logo. Sony Pictures Television's logo first appeared in 2002, and is nicknamed the "Bars of Boredom" (it has achieved the same ubiquity the Boxes had, mainly by replacing logos on older shows, which the Boxes did as well). The omnipresence of the Boxes and Bars of Boredom (yes, their fans really do give everything a snappy nickname) as well as Sony's plastering have made them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a> of logo fans. The logo consists of "SONY PICTURES TELEVISION" zoomed up to the screen in front of a very bright light. The words zoom out as the light condenses itself into a symbol featuring twelve bars with the light in them. The more common short version doesn't start with the extreme close-up on the company's name, and the music is a majestic, triumphant five-note fanfare. The longer version prefaces it with a "fluttering" sound, played by a piano.

The loud clap is followed by an elongated <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScareChord">Scare Chord</a> on electric organ and the sound of a man laughing heartily, not to say maniacally.

Then the show switched to a neon cartoon monkey head with the same voice over for every episode. For a while, the logo went back to the original setup, but made the monkey rounder and cuter.

</li><li> This was mercilessly mocked by Stewart Lee and Richard Herring in their BBC2 series <em>This Morning With Richard Not Judy</em>
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>THX</strong> used many variants of their familiar logo, but every single one of them uses a famous crescendo called the Deep Note - which, if you were a kid in the 80s, 90s, or 2000s first hearing it, may have been more of a Brown Note.
<ul><li> One of their trailers is lengthy but pleasant, involving fantastic sounds and music created by plantlife in the shape of the logo. Dubbed "Amazing Life".
</li><li> There are many different variants of the THX logo, but the most famous one that many people remember seeing at the start of several Disney, Sony and MGM movies on VHS is one where a blue rectangle fades on screen, then text about how the movie is digitally mastered appears, followed by the THX logo fading in as well and shining. In theaters, the rectangle sequence is longer and "The Audience is Listening" is shown instead. On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a>, a plaque under THX that reads LaserDisc and has an indent between Laser and Disc is attached.
</li><li> Another one features a conductor's hand, which flicks a baton, shooting out a hyperspace conducted with an orchestral fanfare followed by the THX logo zooming in. During the THX logo zooming scene, we hear a more pleasant version of the Deep Note.

In the first one the logo breaks down halfway and a robot repairman named Tex hovers in, opens a hatch on the side, goes inside and is hear hammering and drilling something. Then he comes out, closes the hatch and the logo resumes as normal. In the second version, Tex hooks a toy mooing box into the logo, making it sound like a large herd of cows, followed by the sound of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThunderingHerd" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThunderingHerd">Thundering Herd</a>, which scares him away.

<ul><li> The first logo from 1984 to 1993 had a Pegasus galloping to the front of the camera, grows wings, and flies off as the company name forms; we zoom out from the logo to find it in a triangle with a drawing of the Pegasus above the shape. A different logo with "TRI STAR" in large letters and the triangle placed next to "TRI" was used in 1991-93 in trailers and for the TV division.
</li><li> The second logo from 1993 to 2015 where it takes place at night with dark clouds, a bright light forms a Pegasus which gallops towards the screen and stops to unfold his wings as the company appears above it. The final result shares some similarities with the Columbia logo introduced around the same time, most notably the cloud background and the font used for the company name; both studios are owned by Sony.
</li><li> The current logo from 2015 onwards was created by JAMM VFX where the clouds and the sky are made more realistic, the light forms a fully CGI-animated Pegasus as night turns to day.

A distorted photo of Ubu Roi, a black Labrador Retriever, is shown, where the canine is holding a frisbee. Producer Gary David Goldberg says the line, "Sit, Ubu, sit. Good dog.", which is followed by Ubu's quick, single bark. Ubu was Goldberg's self-described "campus dog", and died in 1984.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RobotChicken">Robot Chicken</a></em> parodied this right beside their own vanity plates with a similar looking photo of a toy dog.

</li><li> <strong>Universal Television</strong>:
<ul><li> The roots of Universal's TV production arm go back to <strong>Revue Productions</strong>, established by MCA in 1943 to produce radio shows and USO Stage Door Canteen events. It began TV productions in 1950 and introduced the following year its <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHIv6Rgpbsg">first logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, featuring a rotating TV camera and a overdramatic horn fanfare weirdly reminiscent of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jaws">Jaws</a></em> theme; it lasted a couple of years before being replaced by a simple "[Produced by/Filmed at] Revue in Hollywood" text.
</li><li> Meanwhile, <strong>MCA-TV</strong> was founded in 1951 as a TV distribution arm. It first used a film reel with "MCA-TV" on it as their logo (as can be seen on Revue Productions' first logo above), switching in 1956 to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpYGixFLEbY">the "Arrowhead" logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, a common sight on old prints of pre-1950 Paramount films as MCA had acquired the rights to them a few years after Paramount's 1948 antitrust lawsuit. From about the early 1980s until MCA-TV was merged into Universal Television in 1996 it used logos similar to the then-current movie logos.
</li><li> After MCA purchased the Universal Studios lot in 1958, Revue Productions and the lot were renamed <strong>Revue Studios</strong> and a new logo debuted, "The Filmstrips", which had black-and-white and color versions (the latter featuring a wallflower pattern very much of its era) and featured a fanfare written by space-age pop legend Juan Garcia Esquivel and Universal music director Stanley Wilson which would be used by successor Universal Television in one shape or another until 1991. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI0BSoaEf90">Here's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a black-and-white example of the "long" version and <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AfX8A8V9BE">here's<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> a color example of the "short" version; a "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORjMh22ENE0">blinking negatives<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" variant was used alongside co-producer logos.
</li><li> When MCA acquired Universal's parent Decca Records in 1962, the TV division was renamed <strong>Universal Television</strong>; after a brief period of using <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXVOZQGTnVo">a modified version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of the "blinking negatives" Revue logo, the then-current "Zooming Globe" logo was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av0-NfjaUhQ">adapted for television<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Initially zooming like its movie counterpart, the globe <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B01N6QgdYaw">became stationary<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by the early 1970s. The Esquivel-Wilson fanfare was rearranged roughly once every season; first using the "short" Revue theme (four-note intro, nine-note fanfare) in the 1960s, then one based on the nine-note fanfare in the early 1970s (which was sometimes worked into the end credits music, such as on <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zu5BjjXaDY">Banacek<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_wMFjfg0I8">McMillan &amp; Wife<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> and other shows), then <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0jdIgLY0zw">a five-note fanfare<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> based on the four-note intro from 1975 until the "Zooming Globe" was retired in 1990. When the movie logo was updated in 1990 and 1997, the TV logo was updated accordingly, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26csCUcJSBU">1990 version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being a sped-up version of its movie counterpart with a fanfare based on the 75th Anniversary variant and the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3oCwI-mVw">1997 version<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> being a near-still logo with a fanfare based on the first few notes of the movie fanfare.
</li><li> When NBC and Universal merged in 2004, Universal Television became <strong>NBCUniversal Television</strong>, with a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI7_fESXHOo">logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> incoporating NBC trademarks (the peacock, a fanfare based on the "G-E-C" chimes) with the Universal globe motif. A 2011 rebrand of NBCUniversal led to <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMbJzz5J5yI">a new logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> which was derided for its lack of effort, being simply the company name in plain text appearing over a purple satin backdrop.
</li><li> While the TV distribution arm still uses the NBCUniversal name, the TV production arm became <strong>Universal Media Studios</strong> in 2007 and the logo was <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfZyPgbvMP8">updated accordingly<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. In 2011, the <strong>Universal Television</strong> name was resurrected complete with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2fOoeP4bkE">a snazzy new logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> with a fanfare modified from the NBCUniversal one <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySimilarSong">barely enough to be distinct</a>. (A <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vF68PaaeCww">placeholder<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was used for a month which had the globe spinning the wrong way around).
</li></ul></li><li> In arguably the ultimate example, the shortlived 1992-93 sitcom <em>Camp Wilder</em> (notable mainly for featuring Jay Mohr, Hilary Swank and Tina Majorino in early roles) came from a company called <strong>Vanity Logo Productions</strong> (the logo itself was the company name in front of a cresting wave).
</li><li> Russell Brand's production company takes this to the logical extreme by being called <strong>Vanity Projects</strong>, and having as its logo a crudely-drawn boy widdling and giving a thumbs-up.
</li><li> <strong>Very Good Productions</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenDeGeneres" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EllenDeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a>' production company, which produced her current talk show and <em>Bethany</em>, among others. In this logo, Ellen, wearing black pants and standing, is crossing her legs, while she says, "Anyway..."
</li><li> <strong>Viacom:</strong> The first incarnation of Viacom (now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS">CBS Corporation</a>) had many:
<ul><li> The first, used from 1971 to 1976, is commonly known as "Pinball". It featured the V-IA-COM segments of the company name sliding in from the right, in that order, as the background changes colors. VIACOM zooms back to reveal "A" and "PRESENTATION" on each side of it.
</li><li> Its successor, nicknamed "The V of Doom", was used between 1976 to 1986. It can occasionally still be seen at the end of old prints of CBS programs, although for the most part it has been supplanted by the CBS Television Distribution logo (and occassionaly the 1995 Paramount Television logo on any surviving 90s prints of these shows). It began with the phrase "A Viacom Presentation" zooming in from the center of the screen, followed by a large purple V which fills most of the screen. Accompanying this is a five-note motif played by synthesized horns with a building timpani crescendo. As with the Screen Gems "S from Hell" logo, some viewers actually found the whole sequence frightening; have a peek of it <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10LDTLjEPDM">on YouTube<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and see for yourself.
<ul><li> It's so infamous that <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ4-JwsgCxA">some people have even made their own covers of the jingle<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> and made <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dselGGpMsyM">spoofs<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to the point where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">the logo has become a meme</a> in recent years.
</li></ul></li><li> Its successor, in use from 1986 to 1990, is commonly known as the "V of Steel". It started with the screen divided into a purple half and a silver half. The silver half turned itself upward, revealing itself to be the "V" from the previous logo, redone in CGI. The word "Viacom" (in the same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Fonts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Fonts">typeface</a> as before) fell down and landed under the V.
</li><li> A completely new logo, which goes by the nickname "Wigga-Wigga", was used from 1990 to 1999. It starts with a V (different from before) over a blue background, which zig-zags (and makes "wigga-wigga" sounds, hence the nickname) and forms the word "VIACOM", which is then spoken by a booming male voice (rumored to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonLaFontaine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonLaFontaine">Don LaFontaine</a>). (This logo was designed by Chermayeff and Geismar, also responsible for the Screen Gems "S from Hell" and the 1986 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NBC">NBC</a> Peacock). It was carried over to Viacom's final plate, used from 1999 to 2004. The "VIACOM" letters were made of glass and zoomed out over a blue background with the letterforms in it. "PRODUCTIONS" was under it, along with a Paramount byline.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>VID:</strong> A Russian TV studio best known for becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">Memetic Mutation</a> with the Russians. Its logo consists of a vibrating line with a ball bouncing on it, then the ball explodes into a black background and an infamously scary-looking mask fades in along with a sinister jingle.
</li><li> <strong>Vidyashree Pictures</strong>: on Sadaa Suhagan, it has a green manji (a swastika, but it means good luck) in a box with, "VIDYASHREE FILMS" under it, with "PRESENTS" under that, all also green. The background is a calm ocean.
<ul><li> But on Kala Bazaar, we were treated to a color changing, spinning swastika that would stop as a orange manji with the company name under it in neon blue.
</li></ul></li><li> <strong>Vin Di Bona Productions</strong>: Best known for <em>America's Funniest Home Videos.</em> The plate, which endured many updates over 21 years of use, consists of the "Vin Di Bona" script spinning around and unfolding. "PRODUCTIONS" will appear afterwards, though in recent years PRODUCTIONS has unfolded along with the rest of the name. This fall, the logo was dramatically revised, with the background turned red and the script redone. The music has always been a bizarre synth ditty attempting to sound cheerful but failing as 80's synth tends to do, though the new revision saw it <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LighterAndSofter">greatly toned down</a>.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VIZMedia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/VIZMedia">VIZ Media</a></strong> has two: One, used throughout the '80's and '90's when it was just a distributor for other companies' shows and anime (see any opening for a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> VHS), that had a gold, CGI brick swirling against a a starry backdrop with ominous music playing in the background until the brick stopped spinning and broke apart with an almighty crash as the individual plates that made the brick flew across the screen and formed the gold "V". Its modern logo is the words "Viz" colliding with a red block, which causes the red block to spin around, while traditional Japanese woodwinds play in the background until the logo freezes and the word "Media" fades right underneath "VIZ".
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Walt Disney Pictures</a></strong>:
<ul><li> Disney didn't really have a consistent one until 1985, when an animated, 2D, segmented (like many other logos of the era) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SleepingBeauty">Sleeping Beauty</a> Castle made its debut in front of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBlackCauldron">The Black Cauldron</a></em>. It was revised in 1990, when the purple gradient inside the castle was removed. This may be the only example of a theatrical film company to use a stylized logo that stuck, in part because they had no iconic logo <em>until</em> then.
</li><li> This logo was finally retired in 2006, when an elaborate computer animated sequence that switched out the Sleeping Beauty Castle for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a> Castle debuted in front of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanDeadMansChest">Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</a></em> (this version was done by visual effects company <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WETA" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WETA">WETA Digital</a>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Pixar">Pixar</a> movies prior to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WallE">Wall E</a></em> use a (different) CGI variation of the castle.
</li><li> It should be noted that from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMuppets">The Muppets</a></em> onwards, the "Walt Disney Pictures" name in the logo was shortened to simply "Disney". <a class="urllink" href="http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2011/11/29/why-quot-walt-quot-and-quot-pictures-quot-has-been-clipped-off-of-the-new-quot-disney-quot-logo.aspx#.UJdiQNejuAo">This was ostensibly done for the sake of mobile devices.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DisneyAnimatedCanon">Walt Disney Animation Studios</a> now has its own logo, perhaps to differentiate from Pixar films but more likely as a show of pride and legacy, featuring the iconic shot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyMouse">Mickey Mouse</a> whistling and steering the steamboat from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SteamboatWillie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SteamboatWillie">Steamboat Willie</a></em>, going from initial sketch to finished animation as it plays out.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Disney">Disney</a> releases have used <a class="urllink" href="http://www.closinglogos.com/page/Walt+Disney+Studios+Home+Entertainment">plenty of logos<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that differ greatly from the standard vanity plate. The following are the base versions of the logos:
<ul><li> The first of these for the company's initial Discovision and VHS/Laserdisc releases is nicknamed "Neon Mickey". The "Neon Mickey" logo depicted a spinning Mickey Mouse silhouette that changed colors while Walt Disney's personal signature in yellow was drawn out in front of it; after it finished, the words "Home Entertainment" appeared below it and came in, completing the logo; during the logo, a loud marching theme with snares in minor key is playing. The 1983 update changes the Disney logo to the corporate signature and the words to "Home Video".
</li><li> A few international releases around this time didn't use a proper logo; instead, they used the short version of the 1981-1983 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaltDisneyPresents">Walt Disney</a></em> intro, with a "HOME VIDEO" banner tacked on at the end.
</li><li> In 1984 the Walt Disney Classics series was created, and the first seven releases in this line featured a special opening for the tape in place of the Walt Disney Home Video logo; it used a spinning and dancing The Classics and Walt Disney Home Video logos <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note587e1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note587e1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note587e1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> A red Walt Disney Home Video logo appears first from the right, followed by The Classics in a neon white text while the Home Video logo circles into the background </span> with a large black rhombus diamond animation appearing from the middle of the screen at the end <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note64gj5');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note64gj5" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note64gj5');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> At this point, the blue screen behind the logo (this and not the 1985 Walt Disney Pictures logo was the first time a blue screen was in a Disney logo) has shrunk into a four-corner diamond glow shape, and The Classics spins and lands in the upper half while the home video logo goes into the bottom, after which a white neon border closes in and seals the logos inside </span> with a medieval synth jingle <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7p1i1');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7p1i1" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7p1i1');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> An organ note plays when the diamond appears </span> playing instead.
</li><li> In 1986, the "Neon Mickey" logo was replaced with the Sorcerer Mickey logo. This logo opens with an image of Sorcerer Mickey like on the cases and labels of non-Classics titles appearing and a low tuba synth playing. The camera moves toward his left hand, which has a small spark getting ready to erupt, and eventually, it does, and begins spelling out Walt Disney in the red corporate font as Mickey disappears offscreen to the left. As the signature nears completion, the words "Home Video" in a different font from before (but still the color red) zooms out from the camera and settles under the signature, which then glows and flashes (some tapes also have the word "presents" appear under the logo); a very small jingle that has a hint of the "Walt Disney And You" theme plays across this logo. This is the same color logo from the covers of the Neon Mickey tapes and the Disney logo in the Classics diamond.
</li><li> Come 1988 with the VHS/Laserdisc premiere of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a></em>, the "Cheesy Diamond" Classics logo was replaced with a Sorcerer Mickey Walt Disney Classics logo, which starts the same as the 1986 Walt Disney Home Video logo, but the corporate signature is drawn out in silver and a violin is playing furiously instead of a tuba synth; a four-corner gem-like rhombus diamond then appears in the background as the word Classics in Binner EF font (the same font used in the diamond on the case and tape label) and the C and S bookending it a little bit taller than the rest zooms in from the foreground. When everything lines up, a magic comet flies in from the lower-left, goes behind the diamond for a second, then comes back over the upper right of the diamond and passes over it, turning the Disney logo and the Classics logo gold before it flies off the right of the screen, during which a "diamond" jingle with chimes and, when the comet appears, synth trumpets and an organ, plays. The logo sticks around for a few seconds before fading out; this version has a gradient blue background and a more shiny, metallic sheen on the logo itself, as well as a white-only flash that appears when the larger comet turns the letters gold. On this release, the 1985 Walt Disney Pictures logo with Cinderella's castle (this one has a bluish tint to the logo) then follows, this being its first appearance as an opener on a Classics title. A remake of the logo for the next year's release, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bambi">Bambi</a></em>, changed the background to all-blue, smoothed out the lettering, made the diamond fully black inside, and had the white border of the diamond turn purple when the letters turn gold. With <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneHundredAndOneDalmatians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneHundredAndOneDalmatians">101 Dalmatians</a></em> in 1992, the logo was lightened and faded out quicker, and two releases later, for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRescuers">The Rescuers</a></em>, the jingle over the logo got distorted.
</li><li> In 1992, Disney began using a new Walt Disney Home Video logo that was short and gold, only having a shine effect and a violin crescendo over it.
</li><li> The Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection logo for 1994-1999 started with the corporate Disney signature drawn out in bronze-gold on an arc, while bronze-gold "Masterpiece" and then "Collection" would zoom in; upon the letters almost lining up, Tinker Bell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PeterPan">Peter Pan</a></em> would fly out of the middle of the screen, turn, and wave her wand to create a magenta back plaque with a gold border and a silvery <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a>'s Castle between "Masterpiece" and "Collection"; Tinker Bell would then fly off the left side of the screen, and the logo would flash once (this actually is a different shape from the emblem on the top of a general release tape; it has the same general shape as the emblem on the spine); during the logo, a remix of the Classics jingle plays that omits the opening violin and uses deeper, faster chimes (which sound more like bells) and a pure synth instead of trumpets. As for Tinker Bell, this exact same animation appears in the Roy Disney intro to demonstrate a laptop computer and is actually rotoscoped from the intro to <em>Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color</em> (a different Tinker Bell animation from <em>Walt Disney Presents</em> was on the <em>Robin Hood</em> Classics demo tape a decade prior); the Tinker Bell animation would later be used on the Disney's FastPlay screen on Disney DVDs whose printings started around the exit of CEO Michael Eisner and beyond. The general release Masterpiece titles had this logo after the F.B.I. warnings rather than before the movie<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note809go');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note809go" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note809go');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> As mentioned above, if the tape was printed prior to Katzenberg's exit in August, instead of the Masterpiece Collection logo, the 1986 Walt Disney Home Video logo would play after the F.B.I. warnings and prior to the tape's commercials</span>, and a few general release VHS copies circa 1996 plus virtually all Masterpiece LDs that same year on replace the Masterpiece jingle with the 1992 distorted Walt Disney Classics jingle (it still omits the violin, and the jingle goes on a little longer with the ending organ note being prolonged); the logo would flash twice in this scenario (sometimes the logo with the Classics jingle is a different shade, making the magenta backing look completely purple.
</li><li> The following Gold Classic Collection logo featured a belt-like plaque design with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cinderella">Cinderella</a>'s Castle in a circle towards the left with "Classic" under it, the words "Gold" and "Collection" sandwiching it, and the corporate Disney logo in gold above the belt with a regal blue background behind everything<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note9w50d');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note9w50d" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note9w50d');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> The logo is similar in design to the Keurig Brewed seal from Green Mountain Coffee Keurig products, if that helps </span>; this logo was static, playing immediately after the starting F.B.I. warnings on every release, and it simply had the Gold Walt Disney Home Video jingle (a violin crescendo) as opposed to a Classics/Masterpiece Collection jingle remix (plus the logo didn't appear on many releases; videos and DVDs that didn't have it had the regular Gold Walt Disney Home Video logo).
</li><li> In late 2001, Walt Disney Home Video was redubbed Walt Disney Home Entertainment. The new WDHE logo features the gold corporate signature zooming in against a shooting star background (blue for tapes and disks containing animation, black for strictly live-action tapes and disks<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note10echw');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note10echw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note10echw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Much like how when the Gold Walt Disney Home Video logo was created, it was only used on tapes that were strictly live-action programs for its first three years; any tapes that contained animation or were part of the Disney Sing-Along Songs/Walt Disney Mini Classics/Disney Favorite Stories lines continued to use the 1986 Sorcerer Mickey Walt Disney Home Video logo (with movies in the Walt Disney Classics/Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection line during this period either having their line's logo or the Sorcerer Mickey logo on them until the final year of the Masterpiece Collection)</span>) and reaching the top half of the screen while a glow under it forms into a gold arc with a star at the point of origin, after which the words "Home Entertainment" appear under the arc and complete the logo (this logo is Walt Disney Home Video's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSource" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImageSource">Image Source</a>). The jingle that plays over this is a simple choral arrangement with a clash of cymbals when the words "Home Entertainment" appear.
</li><li> At this same time, a DVD logo was created. There are several versions, all of which use a flute and violin flurry which gets loud and extravagant towards the end. The first version has a starburst that conjures up the silver/platinum letters in DVD, one by one, against a blue background. Then the starburst hits the top of the first D, and creates a silver circle around the right of the DVD logo while the corporate Disney signature without Walt appears on its upper left. The starburst streaks across the bottom of the screen, writing "Pure Digital Magic!", before the starburst stops in front of the screen, where it's revealed to be Tinker Bell from <em>Peter Pan</em>, then she flies off. The later version in 2005 has the starburst Tinker Bell conjuring up the D in Disney while it twists around. After the third pass, the entire Disney signature, which has a less metallic sheen to it much like the post 1988 Walt Disney Classics logos, would turn and go to the upper-left-center while the letters in DVD zoomed in. Then the circle-loop would be conjured, a plaque at the bottom that reads "Movies, Magic, &amp; More!" would appear at the bottom, and Tinker Bell would do the same pose as before prior to the logo ending; later 2000's DVDs have fireworks added to the point of origin of the circle-loop, and that version of the logo is still used occasionally as of 2014. Likewise, there techcnially exist four versions of the Tinkerbell animation, with the first version being a CG animation used in the first two variants. The second version was a traditionally drawn animation of Tink. The third and final version went back to a CG animation, this time based on the Disney Fairies line of movies.
</li><li> In 2004, we get Disney's FastPlay. This DVD feature was added in 2004 and, after the opening Walt Disney Home Entertainment logo, plays a screen with a static Disney DVD logo, with Tinker Bell emerging and turning it into the Disney's FastPlay logo while an announcer is talking (the Tinker Bell animation for this logo is recycled from the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection logo, which itself was rotoscoped from <em>Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color</em>; the Disney's FastPlay logo is identical to the Disney DVD logo except DVD is replaced with, of course, the word FastPlay and the loop is replaced with a disc graphic). The viewer is presented three choices on this screen; they can select the main menu, the FastPlay option, which runs the disc like a VHS (the trailers, Disney DVD logo, program, and bonus features will play in that order before going to the main menu), or do nothing, and after a few seconds, FastPlay starts automatically.
</li><li> In 2007/2008, a new opening replaced the Walt Disney Home Entertainment logo. This opening is a slideshow of Disney movies up to this point and eventually ends in screens building the 2006 Disney castle, with "Movies, Magic, More" in the mix, all set to the Overture from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodPrinceOfThieves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RobinHoodPrinceOfThieves">Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</a>. The castle graphic ends with the traditional arc, but only says "Disney". This is known as the "There is only one Disney" opening due to that being the final and key words from the narrator in this opening. The tune that plays over this is a full orchestra arrangement with chimes/bells over the castle.
</li><li> Finally, there is the Disney Blu-ray logo, which starts similar to the 2006 Walt Disney Pictures logo, but as the camera reaches the front of Cinderella's Castle, the camera suddenly zooms out and leaves the castle behind in a blue Disney corporate signature while a laser beam etches out Blu-ray Disc on the bottom; meanwhile, two swooshes appear on both sides of the logo and the words "Magic in High-Definition" appear under it; the main Disney Blu-ray logo on the disc cover and case has the swooshes but only says "Blu-ray". The current Home Entertainment logo is identical to the Disney/Walt Disney Pictures logos in its two forms.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerBros">Warner Bros.</a></strong>:
<ul><li> While it consists of a basic reveal of the logo, the colour of said logo and the style of music used is genre appropriate. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> movies have it in brown for example, flying past the camera. If it's not tied in to the movie it's with, it'll usually be accompanied by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Casablanca">"As Time Goes By"</a>.
</li><li> The short-lived Warner Bros.-Seven Arts logo had two variants; an animated version that appeared over the film's opening scene, or a still version that was usually on a black background.
</li><li> The Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Bros. Family logos have <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny">Bugs Bunny</a> leaning on the logo (sometimes preceded by him coming out from behind it) and chewing a carrot. The usual fanfare is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">"Merrily We Roll Along"</a>, while through the '90s and early 2000s the animated TV series had the final bars of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></em> theme ("Those are the facts!").
</li><li> In the '70s and early '80s the Warner Brothers logo went from the "WB" shield to a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfuOw9QE2lY">stylized "W"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> following with a general trend within the industry at the time. It reverted back to the "WB" shield in 1984 though the logo lives on in the now unrelated music conglomerate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMusicGroup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WarnerMusicGroup">Warner Music Group</a>.
</li><li> The Warner Bros. Television logo was generally static, with the exception of <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7kTBJyv_Tg">the 50th Anniversary variant<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Had the anniversary banner not been flowing in a direction <em>opposite to the one the shield was travelling in</em>, the logo might not be static today.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TyHhP82pRc">1985's ''Follow That Bird'' showed<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> an animated Big Bird inflating a large "W", which rose to form an animated version of the WB shield. "Sesame Street is brought to you today by the letters 'W' and 'B'!"
</li><li> After WB's absorption of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewLineCinema" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NewLineCinema">New Line Cinema</a>, New Line films starting with <em>The Rite</em> begin with a basic shot of the WB shield, whose golden parts then seperate and fly past the camera to a night skyline to assemble into the New Line Cinema logo, now in gold. The excess parts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuityNod">still</a> fly past the New Line logo.
</li><li> Warner Animation Group's logo consists of the usual Warner Bros. movie logo before flipping around to reveal its own logo on the other side, a shield with a white border with a red interior, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">almost similar to the logos seen before the</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes">Looney Tunes</a></em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack">cartoons</a>.
</li><li> The Warner Home Video logo has three major variations. The first one simply had the W in the old Warner Communications logo zoom-out from the camera and settle below a bar that said Warner Home Video. In 1985, a second version with the Warner Bros. sky background appeared, and this one has the Warner Home Video bar slide in from the front of the screen (the camera zooms-out from just under the top of the bar and the letters under it) at which point it turns and faces the camera as the WB shield minus a belt follows it and lines up above it. A synth version of the classic Warner fanfare plays over the logo. This was replaced by another version that has the WB shield fade in from thin air, with the Warner Home Video marker now on the belt over the shield, and a piano number plays; the wording was changed to Warner Home Entertainment when they moved into DVD.

Their plate is a blurry picture of the Williams Street studio, with a low tympani roll and a few ominous gongs. (The audio is actually ripped off of Mark VII Limited's plate from the 1960s above.) In recent years, the plate is followed by a split-second (sometimes longer) flash of a skull and crossbones image (with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CartoonNetwork">Cartoon Network</a> logo for its teeth, which also looks like a censored bar, fittingly enough) on a white background, with a voice speaking or shouting, "Skull!"

They leave the screen completely, leaving behind thin white lines, in the middle of which sat a somewhat metallic, large white dot. The arrowheads would then come from varying directions, red from the top left corner, green from the top right corner, and yellow from the bottom. They would then form a triangle around the dot: yellow on top, green on the bottom left, and red on the bottom right. The words "WORLD SPORTS" would come up from the bottom of the screen and stop under the newly-formed shape. The word "Enterprises" would fade in under "WORLD SPORTS", while the lines the dot sat in the middle of would fade out.

</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWE">WWE</a></strong>:
<ul><li> Front and back Vanity Plates. The Vanity Plate at the beginning of their programming is a 30-second montage of soundbites and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blipvert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Blipvert">blipverts</a> of moments throughout their history. The Vanity Plate at the end is a simple light panning over the WWE logo. Both Vanity Plates were notably absent from <em>ECW <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NetworkDecay">on Sci-Fi</a></em>, a holdover from the early days of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revival">Revival</a> when WWE was trying to separate the new ECW from the other two "brands" as much as possible. WWE's front Vanity Plate has since been parodied in the form of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Botchamania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Botchamania">Botchamania</a>'s opening sequence.
</li><li> In July 2012, to coincide with the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">1000th episode</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">WWE Raw</a></em>, the company introduced new front &amp; back vanity plates. The new opening signature is a short montage of photos of WWE wrestlers and arenas that appear in rapid succession before the WWE logo itself appears against a white background, with "Then. Now. Forever." fading in next to it. The Vanity Plate at the end is the word "<strong>ENTERTAINMENT</strong>" appearing against a black background, then changing to the WWE logo in a flash of light.
</li><li> The company launched a new logo in August 2014. Despite that, their opening intro plate remains essentially the same, only switching out the old "scratch" logo with the new logo at the end. The old "<strong>ENTERTAINMENT</strong>" closing plate has now been replaced with a brand new one, depicting the new WWE logo being formed like building blocks against an "industrial" nighttime setting.
</li><li> There have been other Vanity Plates WWE has used throughout history. From 1984 to 1988, the WWF block logo emerges in a starry background, with the words "<strong>WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION</strong>" appearing below, one by one, followed by an announcer's voice saying, "The recognized symbol of excellence in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology">Sports Entertainment</a>." It was reused on the Old School <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WWERaw">Raw</a></em>, but with "FEDERATION" crossed out and "ENTERTAINMENT" written below it. From 1988 to 1991, the plate show moving imagery with an announcer's voice saying, "The World Wrestling Federation, what the world is watching." Signatures from 1991 to 1997 simply showed the WWF block logo with "WORLD WRESTLING FEDERATION" below it and the announcer's voice said, "The World Wrestling Federation, for over 50 years, the revolutionary force in Sports Entertainment." Different WWF signatures were produced for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/AttitudeEra">Attitude Era</a>.
</li></ul></li></ul><p>In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime">anime</a> series, the Vanity Plate appears before the beginning of the program, not after the end. There are frequently several of them, each from a different production company that collaborated in making the series. It is rare for the actual animation studio to display a Vanity Plate — unlike in North America, the animation studios are separate companies from the production companies that put series together. Instead, the studio will have its logo discreetly included in the ending credits. (Notable exceptions: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StudioGhibli">Studio Ghibli</a>, whose Vanity Plate features one of their best-known characters, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MyNeighborTotoro">Totoro</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ToeiAnimation">Toei Animation</a>, which shows bubbles combining into one space to create Pero's head.)

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    UK Television </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<p>Until 1 January 1988, the UK's various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ITV">ITV</a> companies put vanity plates in front of their shows. These are referred to as "front caps", representing the companies that also broadcast the ITV network, and usually doubled as station ID's locally (known as "idents"). For a very brief period after the front caps were done away with, some companies used animated post-credits vanity plates (referred appropriately to as "end caps") until 1989.
</p><p></p><ul><li> <strong>ABC:</strong> Its animated logo, introduced in 1958, features three triangles falling down and spelling out the company's initials, which then fold into a shield. The 1964 revision begins with the shield zooming in, followed by the same animation as before. Both versions are accompanied by a three-note jingle composed by Bob Sharples — the three notes are, wait for it, A, B and C.
</li><li> <strong>Anglia:</strong> A rotating statue of a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8iSlnlQTZM">silver knight<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> on horseback carrying a flag with "Anglia" engraved on it, accompanied by a refrain from Handel's Water Music. An <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6fxtP3eY_M">extra-long<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> version appeared as the station sign-on every morning. After 29 years, it was replaced 1988 by an animated flag with an A made up of different coloured triangles which was briefly used an animated end vanity plate. This "A" was designed by Lambie-Nairn (who also designed the current logo of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC">The BBC</a>), and the original "flag" ident was used until 1999.
</li><li> <strong>ATV:</strong> With "front caps" known as "zooms", these mainly featured the station logo (two overlapping eyes, one being the "shadow" of the other, with the letters A, T and V in the holes) zooming into centre position on screen. As colour dawned for the station in 1969, the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KfyMIgtXPw">"Colour Zoom"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> sequence changed to a "colour chart" of red, green and blue circles morphing together and the yellow station logo appearing in a burst of colour along with a bombastic jingle.
</li><li> <strong>Border:</strong> For most of the "front cap" era, a still silent logo with two lines joining together as one inside the shape of a TV, an abstract representation of the broadcast region. Known in fan circles as "the chopsticks in a bowl" as it's indistinct what it represents without explanation.
</li><li> <strong>Central:</strong> Started off as in 1982 as a sphere which split open with a ray of light to resolve as a white ball with the left part shadowed in a crescent shape. Replaced with a different <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV1ooMptQWc">"sphere"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1983 with the crescent part of the sphere in the colours of the rainbow, sometimes referred to as "Moon". The well-loved amongst fans <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODtBOTkaEDs">"Cake"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, an abstract version of "Sphere with segments cut into the sphere, first appeared in promos and idents in the region in 1985, before replacing the sphere as an short-lived animated endcap, in proper vanity plate fashion in 1988.
</li><li> <strong>Channel:</strong> Started off in 1962 with their first ident, six hexagons appearing one by one on screen, one of with the mask of a leopard; it lasted a solid 20 years, changing from black and white to blue and yellow in 1976 when Channel became the last ITV region to get colour. From there, they gained a new more modern logo with the letters "CTV" made up of stripes, zooming in from centre. After that, they used a multitude of different logos but few with any staying power besides their "Channel Island globe" ident.
</li><li> <strong>Grampian:</strong> The first ident was an abstract depiction of a hilly landscape which then reformed into the station's St Andrew's flag logo, all very patriotic. They later went for a sub-ATV morphing of components of the station logo when the station began colour broadcasts. They later used one of the first CGI frontcaps in the ITV network, with balls and diamonds tumbling around the screen before the station logo resolved.
</li><li> <strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Granada" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Granada">Granada</a>:</strong> Famously silent and reflective of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OopNorth">Oop North</a> stoicness throughout the "front cap" era, the first logo featured a sometimes-animated northwards pointing arrow with the slogan "From the North" above the station name. After a brief flirtation with using just the word "Granada" underlined in the late 1960s, the station introduced its classic logo on the cusp of switching to colour in 1969 - the yellow G with a north-pointing arrow. For a long time barring a few 30th anniversary logos their logos were entirely silent affairs until they became slightly less dull with their "stripe" idents in the early 90s but hit their stride in the mid to late 90s with a big and bombastic ident placing their famous G (now apparently rendered as a large transparent perspex block) front and center, based off the stripe logo.
</li><li> <strong>HTV:</strong> The first <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ndnGlJzlA">infamous<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> logo used monochrome cross-hatching effects to form the word "Harlech" which reportedly caused eyestrain among viewers though this only affected higher resolution screens, the more common lower resolution screens didn't exhibit the eyestraining moiré effect. Thankfully, the station's decision to abbreviate the name to HTV to appease non-Welsh viewers led to a less seizureriffic "front cap", where two white diagonal lines wiped on screen and morphed to form the new station logo, dubbed "the aerial" by front cap fans. Became a CGI-fest of tumbling logo components falling into place forming the logo in 1987.
</li><li> <strong>LWT:</strong> Beginning as the words "From London Weekend" zooming into view with a late-'60s Moog jingle, it soon evolved into the "From London Weekend" encased in a spinning circle, dubbed "the pound coin" by later generations. 1971 saw the launch of "the river", where a line made up of blue, white and orange/red stripes formed the joined-up letters "LW" on a black background; <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3D26JrZOr8">amended<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1978 for the letters to read "LWT" with the station name extended to "London Weekend Television". The station front-cap gave into the CGI era in 1986, as the stripes making up the "LWT" letters did a "folding out" effect to form the station logo. A very impressive (for its time) CGI ident was introduced in 1996, which showed three squares (one red, one white, one blue) break into a flurry of cubes, which flew down to a white smoke and formed the LWT logo (which has been amended so that the "L" is red, the "W" is white and the "T" is blue). Their final ident was introduced in 2000 (as a strike against network-mandated idents introduced the previous year), which zoomed over and up to a video wall with the "LWT" on it, along with ITV's "hearts" idents of the era surrounding it. Much of this wall was originally tinted red, and the music was mainly ambient beats with conspicuous beeps, reasonably nice but those in charge needed something more dynamic for a company as loud and proud as LWT with a reversion coming shortly after containing a lot more blue, a lot less red and a much more robust theme.
</li><li> <strong>Rediffusion:</strong> The company's logo, the "adastral", usually spun in its "front caps". During the "Associated-Rediffusion" era (1955-64), the jingle was a trombone-and-beeps rendition of "AR" in Morse code (.- .-.); in the "Rediffusion London" era (1964-68) it became a stately horn fanfare.
</li><li> <strong>Scottish:</strong> Early front caps featured the lion rampant - a tumbling effect was used for a while which was amended to a zooming effect when the Lord Lyon King of Arms complained. Colour saw the logo become the stylised letters "STV". 1985 saw the station update its logo to a stylised thistle (nicknamed "Bertie Bassett" due to its resemblance to the mascot of a confectionery company) made up of grey blocks, a blue ball and a purple "top".
</li><li> <strong>Southern:</strong> An eight-pointed star with a halo grows from the middle of the screen. While it initially had a more dramatic horn fanfare, the gentle acoustic guitar riff it used from the 1970s until the end in 1982 is the one mainly associated with the logo.
</li><li> <strong>Thames:</strong> Nearly the same front cap used from the station's beginning in 1968 until the end of the "front cap" era - a shot of London landmarks appearing from the middle of the screen with the word "THAMES" appearing on the front, all on a blue sky with light clouds backdrop. For well-remembered humorous takes on the logo, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogoJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogoJoke">Logo Joke</a>. The background tune "Salute to Thames" is also very well known and also parodied.
</li><li> <strong>TSW:</strong> One of the quirkiest front caps when first seen in 1982, the full sequence saw a TV with a fuzzy signal with sprouting shoot become encased in a blue ball, which mutated into a set of six balls, which were actually green hills from another angle, which settled into place as a blue bar and the TSW letters folded out on screen. <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6or_YWrh8bU">Best to look at it for yourself to see what we're talking about<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. Replaced by a much more boring CGI "front cap" in 1985 from which TSW continued to become more sedate.
</li><li> <strong>TVS:</strong> Using a rainbow-coloured version of the station logo, the "flower" or "shell" depending on which person from the region you talk to<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note114gnl');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note114gnl" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note114gnl');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">it's actually a fleur-de-lys</span>, which either zoomed sedatedly (on weekdays) or span with more vigour (at weekends) to settle beside the letters "TVS". Changed in 1987 to station logos in chrome-effect CGI.
</li><li> <strong>Tyne Tees:</strong> Began as the letters "TTT" morphing from an anchor with a relevant sea-shanty style jingle and "Tyne Tees Television, Channel 8!" ID from early station announcer Adrian Cairns. The station logo changed to a yellow stacked block of letters reading "TTTV" which formed on screen first from various off-screen points, amended later to a computer-style zooming in.
</li><li> <strong>Ulster:</strong> Started out as a <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone">The Twilight Zone</a></em> style mix of dots and lines accompanied by a refrain from "The Mountains of Mourne", a piece of traditional music. Come <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheTroubles">The Troubles</a>, the modified logo with the oscilloscope pattern on the inside of a TV screen shape was usually transmitted still and in silence. Then in 1980, along came "the lollipop" or "the telly on a stick" - a statue with the station logo made from melted silver retrieved from volatile film stock which revolved to the sound of a plinky-plonk early 1980s synth tune. It was intended as an anniversary ident but stuck, still frontcaps though did exist on the few networked programmes it did make.
</li><li> <strong>Westward:</strong> Made use of the station's adopted symbol, a model of the Golden Hind, which later became a real-life statue which the camera panned away from.
</li><li> <strong>Yorkshire:</strong>
<ul><li> A golden chevron which appeared to a few bars from a local folk tune, "On Ilkley Moor B'ah Tat". Unanimated for most of the "front cap" era, 1987 saw the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRBeYLxDRks">"Liquid Gold"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> front cap, with a 3D chevron emerging from a pool of, well, gold liquid.
</li><li> Because of the abruptness of the "On Ilkley Moor B'ah Tat" theme, the Yorkshire Television logo is often considered to be UK's version of "The S from Hell".
</li><li> The old version was animated for the show 3-2-1, with <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVXanknoyLM">the chevron logo bringing an old dustbin to life(!)<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
</li></ul></li></ul><p>ITV (and then Channel Four) also put plates at the end of the shows ("end caps"). Some archive reruns of ITV shows do not include the front caps, although they are often included in British DVD releases.
</p><ul><li> Old shows replayed on TV and recent DVD releases get the ITV1, ITV2, etc. cap. Or else the bland anonymous <em>ITV Studios</em> cap rather than the ident of the original maker. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">It's really not the same</a>.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Video Games </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
Video games often use the "front caps" version, typically by having the plates for various companies involved in production play while the game is loading. Occasionally they're also around during the end credits, although the credits are more likely to use plain text rather than plates. Some notable examples include:
<p></p><ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/The3DOCompany" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/The3DOCompany">The 3DO Company</a>'s logo with voice at the start of most of their games were memorable, especially to those playing the earlier <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmyMen">Army Men</a></em> titles.
</li><li> Activision had many forms of it over the years. Ranging from pieces of the <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWa_bl9YUi8">black background breaking away with light forming the logo before cutting out like a CRT monitor<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp3ttwMxP6c">the stylized V spinning around before the rest of the letters joined together with it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> or with various <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em> based games, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kD4TvoPlUY">the logo decloaking in space before the Enterprise-E<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the U.S.S. Sovereign in the case of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekBridgeCommander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekBridgeCommander">Star Trek: Bridge Commander</a></em> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager">Voyager</a> in the first <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekEliteForce">Star Trek: Elite Force</a></em>, strafes it with a couple of torpedoes.
</li><li> Pandemic's logo had no animation aside from a film grain and an intentionally grainy version of Franklin D. Roosevelt's "fear" saying.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Bungie">Bungie</a> had an <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktnuNj6SZDY">early one<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that showed what looked like blue cells undergoing fission before zooming out to show a globe which is part of the i of the Bungie logo with a short rendition of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo">Covenant Dance</a></em>.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Konami">Konami</a> had a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjFXiyB6Cgs">pretty memorable one complete with iconic "jingle"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> featured in the attract loop of all their arcade and 16-bit releases before they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheyChangedItNowItSucks">adopted the more sedate white-on-red banner logo</a> they use today.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Capcom">Capcom</a>'s SNES-era plate had its logo fade in with a synth fade-in, then at the end the logo would flash to a single guitar chord. (This was mimicked in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan6">Mega Man 6</a></em>, Capcom's last NES game). And the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ResidentEvil">Resident Evil</a></em> vanity plate.
<ul><li> An updated version of the 16-bit Capcom vanity plate was used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DuckTales">DuckTales</a> Remastered</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ApogeeSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ApogeeSoftware">Apogee Software</a> had two commonly-used vanity plates: One featuring a starry background with a starburst at the bottom of the screen (as appears before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretAgent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SecretAgent">Secret Agent</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrystalCaves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrystalCaves">Crystal Caves</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CosmosCosmicAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CosmosCosmicAdventure">Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure</a></em>), and the more iconic orbital view of a planet with their company fanfare playing in the background (as appears before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DukeNukemII">Duke Nukem II</a></em>, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaptorCallOfTheShadows" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RaptorCallOfTheShadows">Raptor: Call of the Shadows</a></em>, and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WackyWheels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WackyWheels">Wacky Wheels</a></em>).
</li><li> Clover Studios had a very ordinary vanity plate, a green 4-leaf clover blooming accompanied by a female voice saying, "Clover..." But in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami">Ōkami</a></em>, one of the standard 'clean up the trashed world' activities you have to do in the game is first dig up black clovers, then bloom them into healthy green ones.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PlatinumGames">PlatinumGames</a>, a company who is composed of several members who used to work at Clover Studios before it went belly-up, has a very beautiful logo animation. It shows several colorful sparkles inside the logo (all of the sparkles are the same sparkle used on the logo itself) as the camera jumps to various areas of the logo, then it zooms out and the entire logo turns a shiny black. All of this is accompanied by beautiful music. Unfortunately, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</a></em> merely uses a static version of the logo, while <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWonderful101">The Wonderful 101</a></em>, being published by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, does not show <em>any</em> logos upon starting up as per Nintendo protocols (Nintendo tends to abstain from showing logos on start-up of their own games ever since the Wii's release).
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RockstarGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RockstarGames">Rockstar Games</a> has done a <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUh3-EK1Msc">unique one-off vanity plate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> for almost every game they've ever made.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Sega">Sega</a> had a different version in <em>nearly every</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> game. Of particular note are the Sega vanity plates from the main <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> games. Originally, <em>Sonic 1</em> was to have a sound test screen featuring an anthropomorphic band and detailed animations; when this was scrapped, the developers decided to fill up the remaining space in the ROM by digitizing the two-note "Se-ga!" jingle from the contemporary Japanese commercials and adding it to the vanity plate. They managed to get the sound to a reasonable quality and threw it in there, and every other main-series Genesis Sonic game had the same jingle in it. It was also present in an earlier version of <em>Sonic 3D Blast/Flickies' Island</em>, but was replaced by the US commercials' "SEGA!" scream in the final product. <br/><br/><em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompilationRerelease">Sonic Mega Collection</a></em> uses the old plate again as a reference. Likewise, so do trailers for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilestoneCelebration">20th anniversary</a> crossover game <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicGenerations">Sonic Generations</a></em> in regards to its history-spanning nature... but the game itself uses the "*whoosh* Sega." plate that is standard for nearly all Sega games as of the late 2000's. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SegaSuperstars">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a></em>, a love letter to Sega as a whole, uses <em>both</em> the new and old Sega plates together on start-up (to make things less awkward, they are separated by the Sumo Digital plate and the copyright disclaimer screen). <br/><br/>In 2017, it has been announced as a part of their new branding project, <em>Amazing SEGA</em>, a <a class="urllink" href="http://segabits.com/blog/2017/05/20/this-is-how-segas-games-will-start-moving-forward/">new<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> intro were introduced, which consists of an eye opening with the SEGA logo swooshing on the reflection of the eye.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuitarHero">Guitar Hero</a> Encore: Rocks the '80s</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Activision">Activision</a> and Harmonix replaced their typical logo plates with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">pixelated ones like what one might expect to see in an '80s video game</a>. Activision kept this retro logo in <em>Guitar Hero On Tour Decades</em> for DS. RedOctane uses their regular logo, but since it consists primarily of a pixelated fireball to begin with, it still fits the sequence.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ValveSoftware">Valve</a> themselves plays ominous guitar music (Which is "<a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUKcAo8AriM">Hazardous Environments<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>" in the soundtracks to the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> games) over a still frame of a man's head with the rotary handle of a garden spigot grafted onto it. For the first two <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife">Half-Life</a></em> games, there's a white guy with the valve replacing his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EyeScream">eye</a>; games from the Orange Box onwards have a bald black guy with the valve sticking out the back of his head. From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DOTA2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DOTA2">DOTA2</a></em> onwards, the head now turns and looks sideways, as the music uses the more intense percussion from the same song.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner">Homestar Runner</a></em> fake-video game corporation Videlectrix has its surreal one of a man falling over displayed in the style of the console/computer the presented game is a pastiche of.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucasArts">LucasArts</a> usually put their logo in the front and back. Once they got bored with the basic logo, they began doing all sorts of stuff to it, like scaring it away with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DayOfTheTentacle">tentacle</a>, parachuting it in, blowing it up, etcetera.
</li><li> Many flash games have vanity plates nowadays; some of the most recognizable include the Miniclip "BOOM!" logo and the Armor Games "Dueling Swords" logo.
</li><li> "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ElectronicArts">EA Games</a>. <em>&lt;whispers&gt;</em> Challenge everything."; "E.A. Sports. It's in the game" (which is actually older and still in use, unlike the other one).
</li><li> nVidia has had a few vanity plates over the years, typically showcasing the company logo and their motto of "The way it's meant to be played". There was at least <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5-X4pqL6QA">one such vanity plate<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> that was unique to the game that showed it (<em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UnrealTournament2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a></em> in this case).
</li><li> On the IGS <strong>Poly Game Master 1</strong> games, it played a short animation on startup with text that says "POLYGAME MASTER" typing in and the IGS logo spinning in from the bottom.
<ul><li> <strong>Poly Game Master 2</strong> games don't have the animated logo (rather, a still Poly Game Master 2 logo with music is used), but they do have an animated IGS logo. It shows a ball zooming towards the screen, which explodes into the IGS logo. An ® symbol appears from the top and bounces to the bottom-right of the logo.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelenetJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TelenetJapan">Wolf Team</a> had several vanity plates over the years:
<ul><li> Almost all its computer games showed "Wolf Team" scrolling up over a detailed background image, followed by "Since 1987" appearing in smaller letters underneath. (Pre-1987 games had instead "Telenet" followed by "A Wolf Team Presents.") The background images varied from game to game at first (e.g. a Fantasm Jewel in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Valis">Valis</a></em>), but most later games had three crossed swords zoom in, with a shield and banner fading in behind them. The musical theme in all cases was two falling chimes played twice.
</li><li> On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaGenesis">Sega Genesis</a>, Wolf Team switched to showing a much simpler trademark logo. The old musical theme was abandoned, though at first the "Wolf Team" text still scrolled up as before. Starting in 1991, both the logo and "Wolf Team" text were angularly stylized in red and black over a white background. On the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SegaCD">Sega CD</a>, this gradually evolved into a more elaborate sequence, with a voice (rumored to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GeorgeTakei">George Takei</a>'s) saying, "Game Creative Staff: Wolf Team."
</li></ul></li><li> <em>Ocean Software</em>, for most of its history, did nothing fancy with its corporate logo. However, an animated vanity plate used in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation">PlayStation</a> releases showed the Ocean logo underwater with a dolphin swimming across in front of it, turning in the middle to mug for the camera.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EightingRaizing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/EightingRaizing">Raizing</a>'s arcade game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode">Attract Modes</a> have the Raizing logo appear while a voice shouts "RAIZING!" with a distinct echo.
</li><li> "Presented by: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CAVE" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CAVE">CAVE</a>!" This was only used on Cave 68000-based games, however; most subsequent games still display the CAVE logo during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttractMode">Attract Mode</a> but without anyone saying the line.
<ul><li> On <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonPachi">DonPachi</a> only, a <a class="urllink" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DPohfh_UQAAX-02?format=jpg&amp;name=large">completely different Cave logo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was used.
