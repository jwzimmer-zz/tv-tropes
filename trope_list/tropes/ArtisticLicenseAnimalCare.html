<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GingaNagareboshiGin">Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMaster">Gohei Takeda</a> trains the protagonist, Gin, to be a bearhound by beating him with a piece of wood, feeding him only raw bear meat (which is mentioned to stink so terrible that even <em>adult dogs</em> cower at the smell of it) and forcing him to get pieces of aforementioned meat from the bottom of a large basin filled with water. Did we mention that this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrainingFromHell">Training from Hell</a> started when Gin was still supposed to be <em>nursed by his mother</em>? While he did grow up into a through-and-through badass, making a puppy go through stuff like that in real life would definitely not end half as well.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SailorMoon">Sailor Moon</a></em> manga, a man feeds sugar candies to Luna. Ignoring the fact that a real cat probably wouldn't even like them or even be able to taste them at all (though this is now under debate), you should never try to give candies to a cat in the first place. In one episode of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNineties">The '90s</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoon">anime</a>, Minako tells a lengthy anecdote about feeding Artemis a piece of caramel and it getting stuck in his teeth. Although Luna and Artemis are alien cats from the planet <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName">Mau</a>, the aforementioned man who fed Luna sugar candies in the manga didn't know this and thought she was an ordinary Earth cat.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WagayaNoOInariSama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/WagayaNoOInariSama">Wagaya No O Inari Sama</a></em> the anime, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kitsune">Kuugen</a> eats <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater">insane</a></em> amounts of chocolate cake, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic">should make</a> <em>ten humans</em> sick, much less a fox. Then again, Kuugen is explicitly supernatural.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Nichijou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Nichijou">Nichijou</a></em>, the Professor doesn't want to eat her green onions, so she tries foisting them on Sakamoto the cat. He responds "Are you trying to kill me!?" (onions and garlic contain chemicals that can destroy his red blood cells).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoldfishWarning" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/GoldfishWarning">Goldfish Warning!</a></em>: A classic anime about a deranged farm school with both animals and humans as students. The school's pet shark lives on a steady diet of potato chips. The goldfish Gyopi and the cows in the school won't eat anything but human junkfood.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em>:
<ul><li> Pokémon may not be exactly like animals, but Ash has been shown feeding Pikachu ice cream and chocolate at least once in the anime. To say nothing of the memetic episode where Pikachu fell in love with ketchup.
</li><li> In an odd inverse, humans in more recent seasons have been shown eating things prepared with Berries normally eaten by Pokémon. Though nothing really states that berries are really bad for humans apart from intense tastes.
</li><li> All of this was actually enforced by the original series bible. Not wanting to raise ethical questions about eating Pokémon (which are obviously more sentient than the average animal, as they're capable of understanding speech and following orders) the show was officially supposed to stay away from showing any person or Pokémon eating meat of any kind and avoid implications of a food chain altogether, and thus even Pokemon obviously based on carnivores like Persian, Arbok, and Gyarados are seen eating either generic kibble styles of food, fruit (both real and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFruitsAndVegetables" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticFruitsAndVegetables">made up</a>) or just whatever the humans are having. Even then, Pokémon eating only human food is something that's frowned upon in-universe. This element is averted in the games, as many Pokédex entries make it clear that Pokémon eat each other and the games have also shown that humans eat Pokémon. The anime does occasionally mention Pokémon preying on one another— specifically Heatmor's Pokédex entry in the <em>Black/White</em> arc talks about it preying on Durant, and Ash's Pidgeotto tried to eat his Caterpie when they met.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonLucarioAndTheMysteryOfMew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/PokemonLucarioAndTheMysteryOfMew">Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew</a></em>, giving Lucario (a dog-based Pokémon), chocolate was a plot point in the movie (then again, this is a part-steel bipedal dog that can shoot hadoukens).
</li></ul></li><li> Several openings in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Toriko">Toriko</a></em> anime have animals eagerly eating chocolate. Unfortunately <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> in that some animals, especially dogs, can taste and as a result, <em>really</em> enjoy chocolate. This just makes it more unfortunate that it's very fatal to them.
</li><li> Makoto from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Free">Free!</a></em> received two goldfish at a carnival years ago. He loved them, however he kept them in a fishbowl. They died, though it's presumed the writers were going for the "goldfish have short lifespans" myth rather than "Mako mistreated his fish". Goldfish need to be kept in proper tanks with aeration, filtration, and moving water, not simple bowls of standing water.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YokaiWatch">Yo-Kai Watch</a></em>, Jibanyan, a cat yo-kai, is seen frequently eating and enjoying chocolate. Despite the fact that chocolate is very bad for cats (and most animals), cats normally don't even like it since they can't taste sweetness... It's a good thing Jibanyan is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadToBeginWith">already dead</a> and on top of that, a yokai. It's also <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded">Lampshaded</a> in one of the games.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventurePhantomBlood">JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood</a></em>, Jonathan feeds Danny, his Great Dane, a grape. Grapes are highly toxic to dogs, even being lethal in certain amounts <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> then again, considering what Dio <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog">does to Danny shortly after,</a> it wouldn't really have mattered</span>.
<ul><li> Iggy, a Boston Terrier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureStardustCrusaders">Stardust Crusaders</a></em>, has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrademarkFavoriteFood">Trademark Favorite Food</a> in the form of <em>coffee-flavored gum</em>, which, not withstanding the fact that coffee is toxic to dogs, also has him swallowing the gum which can potentially lead to intestinal obstruction or constipation. Then again, he <em>is</em> a Stand-user dog with superpowers, so perhaps this is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KemonoMichi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KemonoMichi">Kemono Michi</a></em>, despite being an animal lover, Genzo keeps all the monsters he catches for his future pet shop in tiny cages that are barely bigger than they are. He also leaves his dog, Hiroyki, tied to a stake outside the house at night. And he runs up to dangerous monsters and instantly charms them into loving him but that's probably just the superpower he got for being an isekai protagonist.
</li><li> Transponder Snails in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> take this trope to its logical conclusion: Despite being clearly living things, at no point anywhere in the series is anyone ever seen actually taking care of one. No one ever feeds a Transponder Snail, no equipment or containment seems to exist for their maintenance, and they're just picked up and carried around as if they're portable tools. That being said, Transponder Snails also never tire, change locations of their own will, emit waste, display any emotions not connected to a user, or get sick. They seem to be perfectly content being used as appliances.
</li><li> The treatment of Ton-chan, the pig-nosed turtle adopted by the girls in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KOn">K-On!</a></em>, is a bit of a mixed bag. They rightfully keep it in an aquarium instead of a terrarium, making sure it is not hit by direct sunlight, and they even go out of their way to get a bigger one after Ton-chan has grown. Then again, pig-nosed turtles are notoriously prone to stress, especially caused by noise, so it may not be wise to keep one in a band's rehearsal room.

<ul><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarveyComics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarveyComics">Little Lotta</a></em> comic Lotta wins a pony in a contest, but finds the pony isn't strong enough to carry her, so instead of hay she decides to bulk it up with high-fat goods... including meat. Equines are herbivores. Although, horses <em>can</em> and will eat meat if given the chance... doesn't mean it's that healthy for them though.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke">Lucky Luke</a></em> Lucky Luke is often seen asking for a beer for his horse, Jolly Jumper. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope">This is a very good idea</a>. Horses often like beer as a treat, and there is nothing in beer horses won't eat of their own volition. Horses are much larger than humans and metabolize alcohol much more efficiently, so there is nothing in a beer that can harm a horse. Adding a splash of beer to water is a common way to ensure that a dehydrated horse drinks. Then again, even if that weren't the case, Jolly Jumper would probably get a pass anyway, considering that he fishes, cooks beans, smokes and beats his rider at chess...
</li><li> Harley Quinn loves animals, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/HarleyQuinn">in her own comic</a>, she tends to feed both her two hyenas and stray dogs foods that would make them sick in reality, like hamburgers and pizza.
</li><li> In those versions of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a></em> in which Master Splinter is a rat mutated into a humanoid rather than vice versa, Splinter is apparently the <em>only</em> rat which Hamato Yoshi kept. Rats are social in the extreme and (barring aggression issues) should never be kept alone.

While kittens can be seperated at six to eight weeks, they ideally should stay with their mother for six to twelve weeks.

<ul><li> Bolt is aware of and avoids foods he shouldnt consume (alcohol, onions, garlic, chocolate), and when he purposely drinks a lot of coffee in The Coffee Shop, he does so knowing it will make him sick. In this story, he also starts eating table scraps from the garbage and begging for coffee shop treats, but gains weight doing so. Penny scolds him and puts him on a diet, returning the dogs weight to normal.

A few licks from an ice cream cone, or a little bit of milk is not going to affect a cat that much, but it's still not a good idea given the sugar and other things ice cream is loaded up with, especially since Oliver is a kitten and their digestive systems are not as resilient as an adult cat's (as any cat owner or animal shelter worker who's worked with kittens for long enough can tell you).
</li><li> At the very beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAristocats">The Aristocats</a></em>, the evil butler Edgar actually pours some of Madame's sleeping pills into the titular cats' milk (and Roquefort the mouse due to him eating from a cookie that was dipped into the milk) so he can drug them and take them all away from her mansion while said cats are sleeping. In real life, the amount of sleeping pills Edgar used to drug the cats is enough to kill a <em>human</em>, never mind a cat or any other small species! Since Edgar's goal was to get rid of the cats, he probably wouldn't have cared if he killed them, but the fact that they survive at all shatters suspension of disbelief. Not that it's advisable to give adult cats milk anyway, but at the time the film was made, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">that wouldn't have been common knowledge</a> — it still isn't as well known in this day and age as it should be, especially given the complication (for human comprehension) that some adults cats actually can cope with cow's milk without any reported side-effects.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rio">Rio</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the beginning of the movie, Blu is shown enjoying a hot chocolate and some chocolate chip cookies. Chocolate contains theobromine (a bitter alkaloid compound found in the cacao plant), which is very toxic and potentially fatal for most animals. Most vets will flat out state that animals shouldn't have <em>any</em>, ever, no matter the concentration, just to be safe.
</li><li> Tulio, the bird veterinarian, allows birds to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick">eat out of his mouth</a>, which is extremely dangerous because mammalian saliva is loaded gram-negative bacteria that can kill birds. Lampshaded by Blu when he finds this disgusting.
<ul><li> The entire plot of the movie hinges on the fact that Linda kept Blu for so long without knowing his species, when in reality this would have come to light on her first visit to an exotic vet. Unless, even more unrealistically, she kept a macaw for fifteen years with no veterinary care and had it remain in excellent health up to that point.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original movie, Lilo brings Stitch home for the first time and feeds him coffee. At this point she still thinks he's a regular dog. In real life, one should avoid giving their dogs coffee, because it is poisonous to them. Pets and caffeine simply do not mix. Thank god Stitch is really an alien. He is a little more destructive, but he otherwise has no resulting health problems. Also provides a double whammy of Fridge Brilliance <em>and</em> Fridge Horror: A six-year-old couldn't be expected to know this... and her older sister was too overwhelmed to realize it and provide proper supervision of Stitch's diet.
</li><li> Lilo seems to all around be a poor caretaker of animals. Besides the caffeine thing, she also feeds a fish a peanut butter sandwich once a week. She also tries to train Stitch to fetch by spraying him with water; this type of reinforcement, positive punishment, is strongly recommended <em>against</em> since it can increase aggression and destroy trust. There are reasonable uses for positive punishment, like stopping biting, but punishing an animal to encourage it to do something that ought to be <em>enjoyable</em> makes no sense. In fact, Lilo might have already been a poor caretaker in-universe—in an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LiloAndStitchTheSeries">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></em>, she says that she once had a goldfish who died. While she doesn't say <em>how</em> it died, given the above, it's likely that she was responsible.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a></em> has Percy, Governor Ratcliffe's dog, enjoying a bowl of cherries during a bath. In real life, dogs should not be fed cherries since their pits, leaves and stems contain cyanide, which is poisonous and potentially fatal if consumed in large enough amounts. Cherry pits can also get lodged in a dog's intestinal tract, causing blockage and gastrointestinal upset.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LadyAndTheTramp">Lady and the Tramp</a></em> has right in the first scenes Lady being served coffee (as noted above, toxic) and a donut (not quite toxic, but not healthy for anyone). Also another part has a dog with a muzzle for longer than 30 minutes, something extremely dangerous for the animal. This can be choked down to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a>, possibly even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberateValuesDissonance">Deliberate Values Dissonance</a>, considering the film's early 1900s setting.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail">An American Tail</a></em>, Tiger comments that he's a vegetarian. Cats are carnivorous creatures and wouldn't be able to survive on a vegetarian diet. He did mention he'll eat fish occasionally though, which might cut him a little slack.
</li><li> This seems to be used for humor in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FoodFight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FoodFight">Food Fight</a></em>. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a> dog likes both raisins and chocolate. He's not technically real, being an "ike" (a food mascot), so no damage is done (plus he is anthropomorphic). Just to make it perfectly, crystal clear — both raisins and chocolate (especially dark chocolate) have the potential of being extremely toxic, to the point of being deadly, to dogs. <em>Never feed dogs raisins or chocolate.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FlushedAway" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FlushedAway">Flushed Away</a></em> depicts the main character, a pet rat named Roddy living alone in a cage. The movie later deconstructs this by pointing out how lonely Roddy is, and how it is unhealthy for rats to live this way. Upon seeing his home Rita, a wild rat, is astonished and appalled about how Roddy lives.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheGuardians">Rise of the Guardians</a></em>, some elves are shown fitting an iron shoe onto the hoof of one of Santa's reindeer. While there <em>are</em> shoes designed specifically for reindeer, they generally consist of two separate pieces of metal to allow the hoof's two parts to splay out naturally, and they <em>certainly</em> aren't just a regular horseshoe nailed on <strong>backwards</strong>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneHundredAndOneDalmatians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneHundredAndOneDalmatians">101 Dalmatians</a></em> has the titular puppies at one point being fed on cow's milk, straight from the source (in other words, raw milk). Most animals are lactose intolerant, and dogs are no exception. The puppies were probably already past the age at which they could digest milk, so in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> it would have given them severe diarrhea and upset stomachs. (A case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>, since the movie came out in 1961.)
</li><li> Remy from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ratatouille">Ratatouille</a></em> better not have been taste-testing his own French cooking. Onions or scallions are key ingredients for most of the recipes he's shown preparing, and ingesting either of these can destroy a rat's red blood cells. Handling or even sniffing such food could've left him severely anemic.

All very sweet, except he's releasing a <em>domesticated</em> bovine into an area of the mountains where the grass is too deeply-buried in snow for grazing, and he doesn't even bother to remove her halter, which has a dangling lead that could easily get caught in a crevice and trap her.

<ul><li> The rabbits in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WatershipDown">Watership Down</a></em> are obsessed with lettuce. While rabbits need a great deal of fresh greens and hay to be healthy, the type of lettuce most often used in salads and sandwiches, iceberg lettuce, is very bad for them. Iceberg lettuce has almost no nutritional value; worse, it contains too much phosphorus, which can end up leaching calcium from their bones. While the rabbits of <em>Watership Down,</em> being wild, would rarely encounter enough lettuce to harm them and might rightly regard it as "flayrah" (their word for superior food), giving a pet rabbit this "flayrah" as a regular part of its diet is a really, really bad idea.
</li><li> Pets in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> seem to be partially magical, but if they weren't, the following would be bad ideas:

Also the behind-the-scenes special features on the DVDs have <em>twice</em> felt the need to directly address the fact that owls do not actually make good pets.
</li><li> Harry attempts to feed Hedwig (owls are carnivores) <em>vegetables</em>. Not his fault — the Dursleys hadn't given Harry anything else to eat himself — but Harry would have been wiser to use the veggies as bait for mice or bugs than to expect Hedwig to eat them. At least Hedwig reacts with disgust, lampshading this.

<ul><li> This was the book that kicked off concern about animal care, mostly by telling people the story of an animal that was taken care of by ignorant humans, and how much the animal suffered for it.
</li><li> One sympathetic character does what he <em>thinks</em> is right for Beauty — gives him a lot of cold water to drink after a straining effort and leaves him standing uncovered in his stall to help him cool off because he's sweating — and it nearly kills him. This becomes a saving grace for Beauty in his later years when the same character, now much older and wiser, recognizes the scars on Beauty's body from the methods used to save Beauty's life at the time of his past mistake. Able to confirm Beauty's identity from these marks, he's then able to ensure Beauty is able to live out the rest of his days with a caring owner who looks after him kindly.
</li></ul></li><li> Played straight in the <em>Bad News Bunny</em> series, whose title rabbit eats nothing but junk food, including Twinkies, Ring Dings and potato chips.

In one of the young reader books, he flat-out tells the readers that he can only eat chocolate because he's fictional, but the trope is otherwise in full effect. While fudge is probably one of the less dangerous types of chocolate a dog the size of Harold can have, it still makes his owners look pretty careless. In another young reader mystery book, his owners are still aware that he steals fudge and also still unaware that he's fictionally immune to chocolate, and the plot is centered around the animals determining what, exactly, a pan of white-chocolate fudge is.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0cb0y');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0cb0y" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0cb0y');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Cocoa butter contains little to no theobromine or caffeine, so <em>white</em> chocolate is considerably safer than dark or even milk chocolate (which contains, in addition to cocoa butter, the dark-colored cocoa solids, where the alkaloids are concentrated)</span>

(Fortunately, Pippi's strong enough to lift and carry it when necessary.)
</li><li> There is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NancyDrew">Nancy Drew</a> novel where someone's dog dies after eating a box of chocolates that arrived in the mail.

</li><li> The titular character of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stargirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Stargirl">Stargirl</a></em> has a pet rat. She's a good owner overall but she only has <em>one</em> rat. Rats are extremely social animals, and unless the owner can devote at least four hours every day toward playing with the rat, it's recommended you have at least two to keep each other company.
</li><li> Mouse is mentioned as having eaten onions once as a gag in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles">The Dresden Files</a></em>. Feeding onions to a canine is a VERY bad idea.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHungerGames">The Hunger Games</a></em>: In <em>Mockingjay</em>, Katniss stuffs Buttercup into a bag and carries him over her shoulder, even elbowing him to get him to be quiet. She also bounces him against the floor. In the book, this only causes yowling. In real life, this would've also caused him a great deal of injury. She also picks Buttercup up by the scruff of his neck without supporting his rump. He's a grown tom cat. Any pet owner will tell you that is a humongous no-no. And after Buttercup is forced into a bag, he allows Prim to tie a ribbon around his neck and hold him in her arms. After being bagged? Both of these actions would probably cause a cat a great deal of distress (possibly causing the animal to retaliate in violence) in real life.
</li><li> In the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADogsPurpose" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ADogsPurpose">A Dog's Journey</a>,</em> Molly the Spaniel-Poodle mix is given ice cream bars, cookies, and pizza by her teenage owner, Clarity. It doesn't help that Clarity has an eating disorder and one of her ways of coping with a situation is by eating a lot of ice cream (well, before she forces herself to throw up, that is), and she will almost always give her puppy just as much as she eats. Averted when Molly is given an ENTIRE bag full of moldy cheese in hunks by Clarity's mother, Gloria, who needed a way to get rid of the expired cheese. Since Gloria doesn't know much about dogs, she assumes that dogs are immune to moldy foods because according to her, they eat just about anything and can be okay since their bodies can handle it... except for the fact Molly ends up getting very sick and begins to vomit until Clarity arrives home from school and sees her poor dog (who is still a puppy) passed out with her tongue hanging out in the yard and, fearing the worst, ends up taking her to the vet. Molly ends up fine with the vet reassuring Clarity that luckily it wasn't anything too bad and whatever she ate must've passed through her and to just keep a watchful eye on her next time. However, that doesn't stop Clarity herself from still giving Molly ice cream bars or pizza. It may not be as bad as eating expired cheese, and Molly doesn't seem to have ill effects and clearly finds the treats delicious. But in reality, all the treats Clarity gives Molly should be making Molly constipated or making her sick with more trips to the vet, as dogs are lactose intolerant and all that dairy can't be good.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RatmansNotebooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RatmansNotebooks">Ratman's Notebooks</a></em>, Ratman uses a raw leek stolen from a neighbor's garden as a training treat for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwarmOfRats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwarmOfRats">Swarm of Rats</a>. Uncooked leeks are toxic to rats, destroying their red blood cells. Since the book's narrator says over and over again that he has no idea how to tell male and female rats apart, it seems safe to say the author <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure">did no research</a>.
</li><li> In the novel <em>Beautiful Joe,</em> written in the same vein as <em>Black Beauty</em> above and depicting the care of animals through the eyes of the titular dog, this trope goes hand-in-hand with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Science Marches On</a>. The methods of care shown in this book were what were thought to be best at the time it was written — and indeed, a good amount of it does still hold true today, but much of it is so blatantly outdated that a reader with even a passing knowledge of animal care will probably take notice. Additionally, a few examples are questionable even for the time period:
<ul><li> Spreading poison on a cat's coat so that they'll lick it off and die is stated to be a "humane" way to euthanize a cat. Why they aren't simply shot like dogs (which would be much faster and less painful) is never explained.
</li><li> A parrot is depicted as being allowed to roam around the house unsupervised. <em>Never</em> do this unless you have thoroughly parrot-proofed your place. Not only are parrots prone to chewing on just about everything they come across as a way to amuse themselves, but their curiosity can lead them into dangerous situations in a hurry, especially if they still possess flight feathers (to say nothing of the bird potentially flying away if a window is left open).

<ul><li> It's implied that Granny Harris kept one budgie for several years, but she kept him permanently caged during that period. She eventually gave him away both because he couldn't talk and she was worried that her new cats would hurt him. Budgies are social birds who need room to exercise, so keeping a lone bird permanently caged is considered neglectful. The budgie's new owners, her daughter and son-in-law, aren't any better. The one time they let the bird out of his cage, he flew around wildly and then flew out the window.

This put both him <em>and</em> the animals he was catching at unnecessary risk. One of the prime examples was an episode where he grabbed a coyote by the tail and lifted it off the ground. Like all mammals (even tiny mice), an adult coyote is too heavy to be safely lifted in this manner, doing so meant that it was at massive risk of a spinal injury.

Real life goldfish <em>do not</em> do well in a bowl — this does not allow enough oxygen to circulate, <em>and</em> it does not give enough space for the fish to move around. She <em>also</em> has a cat in the room, which <em>also</em> isn't a good idea. (Even though some cats can be trained to ignore fish in a tank.) This is softened a little by the fact that it's only in her room for a few episodes, suggesting that maybe she is keeping the fish in a bowl while the tank is cleaned by her family members offscreen.

Can say the same for cattle, tree shrews, and some species of fruit bats, but cant say the same for humans, cats, and dogs. Plus, the ingredients in beer are grains, hops, yeast and water, all things horses will eat on their own (possibly excepting hops).

One of the creature's animations might even be lampshading this: it actively and repeatedly tries to escape the Containment Unit by climbing the front wall.
</li><li> Keeping a falcon in a birdcage and letting it perch on you without a glove on are <em>bad</em> ideas. Sims also seem to feed it birdseed for some reason. Granted, the falcon isn't stated to be one and is essentially a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> of the parrots, but it <em>looks</em> accurate (it's based on a male American Kestrel) and then doesn't work like a real falcon at all.

In addition, turtles having too many barnacles is usually a symptom of an underlying health problem, as healthy turtles in nature are capable of removing their own barnacles. The best way to treat them is to keep them in fresh water for at least 2-3 days (which kills the barnacles and makes them easier to remove).

</li><li> Really, the main premise of the show could count. Multi-species pet day camps don't exist for a reason. Aside from the obvious risk of predatory behavior, each of these animals needs different care that isn't really fulfilled by what's seen on the show. Also, small pets like Vinny and Russel could easily be left at home in a safe enclosure throughout the day, rather than needing to go to a day camp or having someone watch them.

</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyGymPartnersAMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyGymPartnersAMonkey">My Gym Partner's a Monkey</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenHuman">Token Human</a> Adam Lyon proposes adding human food to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAnimal">Funny Animal</a> school's cafeteria. The human food results in everyone except Adam becoming obese, and at the end of the episode, everyone is exercising their weight off.
</li><li> Averted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarthaSpeaks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MarthaSpeaks">Martha Speaks</a></em> where Martha has to avoid eating chocolate or onions because they're poisonous to dogs and cats. They also break the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWall">Fourth Wall</a> in that eating alphabet soup to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerealInducedSuperpowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CerealInducedSuperpowers">keep Martha's ability to talk</a> only works on Martha and wouldn't work for other dogs.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaroldAndThePurpleCrayon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HaroldAndThePurpleCrayon">Harold and the Purple Crayon</a></em> episode, the young protagonist is shown keeping his goldfish in a fish bowl. The fish dies not soon afterwards (presumably under the myth that goldfish are short lived, not because it was kept in a bowl) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASadThing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASadThing">Harold learns about death</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HBOStorybookMusicals" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HBOStorybookMusicals">HBO Storybook Musicals</a></em> episode <em>Ida Sleeps Over</em> depicts a goldfish in a generic fish bowl. Doing that will kill a goldfish very quickly.
</li><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShaunTheSheep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ShaunTheSheep">Shaun the Sheep</a></em>- the farmer feeds his animals appropriately for their species, but Shaun and the other sheep love human foods like pizza, sandwiches, cake, and ice cream. They even have been shown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CarnivoreConfusion">eating meat</a> like hamburgers and roast chicken on occasion, which dips into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror">Fridge Horror</a> given that there are chickens and cows as characters on the show.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DuckTales2017">DuckTales (2017)</a></em> episode "The Rumble For Ragnarok!", Dewey feeds a lollipop to Fenrir the wolf, only for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Fenrir to choke on the candy and spit it back up</a>. This is lampshaded by someone:
