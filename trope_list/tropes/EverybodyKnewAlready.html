Neither Hisae nor her former lover Kanshiro Kondo knows that Heizo knows about this, and when he breaks the news to Heizo, he just laughs — not revealing that he knew (presumably to save face) but merely saying that this fact is insignificant to him because Hisae is a wonderful woman and he's simply happy to have her.

When Batman later reveals his identity to the team, they pretend to be surprised.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GoldDigger">Gold Digger</a></em>, Britanny Diggers did a brief stint as a superhero in her school days. While the villains remained oddly oblivious, the rest of the students had no trouble figuring out the superhero 'Cheets', was actually their classmate Brittany, the only member of the student body who also had fur and a tail and was the only were-cheetah on Earth.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FantasticFour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FantasticFour">The Human Torch's</a> features in <em>Strange Tales</em> involved him protecting his secret identity...despite the fact that he was a celebrity in his main title. Presumably, this was due to a lapse in Stan Lee's memory (<a class="urllink" href="http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2005/11/03/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-23/">which actually has some precedent<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>); eventually, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">retconned</a> that all the supporting cast were simply going along with the Torch's masquerade out of concern for his privacy...
</li><li> Right before the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Flashpoint">Flashpoint</a></em>, Vicki Vale had figured out everyone in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a>'s inner circle's real name sans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2009" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batgirl2009">Stephanie Brown</a>. She had no hard evidence so she didn't run the story.

</li><li> Two examples in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ElfQuest">ElfQuest</a></em>:
<ul><li> The first occurs when Leetah accidentally yells out Cutter's secret soul name in front of Cutter's best friend, Skywise. It turns out Cutter and Skywise have such a strong mental link, they've known each other's soul names since they were kids.
</li><li> The second one occurs when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Winnowill reveals Cutter's animal heritage to Leetah.

Barbara then pulled out her old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Batgirl">Batgirl</a> uniform and added, "I'm afraid there's something else I need to tell you, Daddy." Jim replied, "Oh. Well, <em>that</em> I knew about."
<ul><li> It's been implied numerous times that Gordon knows the identity of each and every one of the Batfamily. He simply chooses to not acknowledge it, even to himself in his thought bubbles.
</li><li> Several stories have had <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Batman">Batman</a> make comments where he's assumed Gordon has long known who he really was, just as he assumes Perry White (who was a very good investigative reporter) knows full well Clark Kent is Superman.

When Clark finally admits to Lois that he's the Blur, she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGlomp">rushes into his arms hard enough to knock him off his feet,</a> kisses him and asks, "What took you so long?"

Towards the end of the piece, one young man worked up the courage to come out to his best friend. He sits her down, lets her know how much their friendship means to him, and that he has something to tell him that he's never told anyone else. He tells her that he's gay. Without blinking, she looks at him and replies, in a slightly confused tone "Yes. What was the secret you wanted to tell me?" In fact, the girl's first words on the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConfessionCam">Confession Cam</a> were "From the moment I met [him], I knew he was gay."

Except, anyone who lives anywhere near the projects knows that he's actually the biggest drug dealer in the city and that he's had countless people murdered. The Police Department's embarrassment from having to admit that they're some of the few people who <em>don't</em> know this is part of what spurs the criminal investigation in the first season.
</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em>, there are a lot of secrets. The paternity of Scully's baby is not one of them.

(The badge that you get when you gain access to their headquarters outside of time is even called "Entrusted With The Secret".) In practice, however, its utility as a teleport nexus for getting around the city quickly means that heroes frequently open glowy/whooshy time portals in plain sight, right in the middle of Atlas Plaza, and most characters arrange to gain access as soon as possible rather than waiting to learn the "secret" by doing one of the mission arcs that are intended to award it.
</li><li> A variation occurs in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect3">Mass Effect 3</a></em> with Barla Von, the volus agent of the Shadow Broker on the Citadel. He makes a big deal of impressing Commander Shepard with some of the Shadow Broker's secret plans, since, of course, he is one of the few in regular contact with the super-secretive galactic information broker ... otherwise known as Liara T'Soni, who became the latest person to assume that identity with Shepard's help; who is running the operation out of Shepard's ship; who is currently sitting in a cafe less than 100 yards away from Barla Von's office; and — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanceSidequest">if you so choose</a> — whom Shepard <em>is sleeping with</em>.

<ul><li> The best part? Barla Von doesn't know who the Shadow Broker really is, but at that point in the series, he's about the <em>only</em> one. Liara's identity is not only known to Shepard, but it's also known to the Normandy crew, Cerberus, Admiral Hackett (and presumably Alliance command and their Council allies, if nothing else Aethyta and the asari governments know), the geth, the krogan, the quarians, the <em>Reapers</em>...
