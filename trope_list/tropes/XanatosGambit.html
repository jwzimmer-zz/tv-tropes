</p><p>A Xanatos Gambit is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePlan">plan</a> for which all foreseeable outcomes benefit the creator — including ones that superficially appear to be failure. The creator predicts potential attempts to thwart the plan, and arranges the situation such that the creator will ultimately benefit even if their adversary "succeeds" in "stopping" them. When faced with a Xanatos Gambit the options are either to accept that the creator will get the upper hand and choose the outcome that is least beneficial to them, or to defeat them by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeAThirdOption">finding a course that they didn't predict</a>.
</p><p>Don't forget. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks">Morons are especially good at the latter</a>...
</p><p>At its most basic, the Xanatos Gambit assumes two possible outcomes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn">the one manipulated</a> — success or failure. The plan is designed in such a way that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MortonsFork">either outcome will ultimately further the plotter's goals</a>. A more complex view is offered by the study of probability in which such a gambit is known as a Dutch Book and involves securing bets such that regardless of the outcome the bookie will always pay out less than was bet.

<ul><li> A game of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Chess">Chess</a> played by two halfway decent people is truly a joy to behold due to the sheer number of Xanatos Gambits. Indeed, the very principle of the Gambit comes from the Chess practice of offering up the sacrifice of a piece in order to gain a positional advantage. It is exceedingly common to sacrifice one's own piece in order to capture an opponent's piece, or simply to break the opponent's defences. Capturing the offered piece is called "Gambit accepted", and refusing is called "Gambit declined". Since many players have multiple such gambits going on at any one time, a game can quickly become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a>.
<ul><li> On a smaller scale, the concept of a fork. He can take one of several pieces; which one will you protect?
</li><li> Another example of this comes in the form of Zugzwang: a situation in which any move the player makes will lead to a disadvantage (either material or positional), and the best possible action would be not to move at all - which is forbidden.
</li></ul></li><li> Connect 4 is generally won through a Xanatos gambit: by setting up two sequences right next to each other, either the other player blocks your first one and allows the second, or ignores both and so allows the first.
</li><li> Tic Tac Toe, capture 3 of the 4 corners to assure that you will win regardless. While not always a board game (in fact, it's usually drawn with paper and pencil), a so-called "double-trap" in Tic-tac-toe is one of the most obvious Xanatos gambits.
</li><li> Diplomacy is a game which thrives on these, as the players must secretly negotiate, manipulate, and lie to each other as a matter of course. For example, a clever player may attempt to offer another player support for a movement quid-pro-quo. If successful, great. If that player denies support, the first player might support him anyway - and mutter quite audibly about how he was just stabbed in the back. At the cost of one turn's disadvantage, the first player has trashed the second's reputation with the entire table.
</li><li> The Chinese game of Go makes this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanDirt">Older Than Dirt</a>, as the game is believed to be the oldest game still being played (at least 2,500 years old), as well as having many situations where both players are doing this simultaneously.
<ul><li> In a situation called 'Ko', you are not allowed to take a stone that has just captured one of yours if it would lead to exactly the same board layout at the end of your previous turn. You must instead play elsewhere, and are allowed to take back on your next turn if your opponent has not played to stop that. In this case you need to make a play somewhere else that makes a threat that will cost your opponent more than he gains by consolidating the original exchange. He responds to your threat, you retake, leaving him in Ko, and so he then must make a threat for you to respond to. Both sides continue this until one player calculates the threat is not worth as much as the Ko position. Even then this may help the other player, as a dead group of stones is saved (or a live group is killed), lessening the value to the other side of winning the Ko.
</li><li> A pair of possible moves is called 'miai' if it doesn't matter which one is played, because the opponent will make the move the other choice would have prevented (often at the same place), and the outcome will be the same either way. This often turns into a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a>, as there's usually no hurry to make a miai move, and it can be saved for a ko threat.
</li><li> Common sequences of moves, known as 'joseki', have become established because they are believed to be best play. Some joseki have many branches, presenting each player with several choices. No matter what they choose (unless they screw up), the player who started the joseki gets some advantage, while their opponent gets a slightly lesser advantage. Those advantages can be various combinations of territory, influence, initiative and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGun">aji</a>, and although which combination of advantages you get depends on your opponent's choices as well as your own, a good player will steer things so that the advantages they get work well with the rest of the board. Players are advised not to learn joseki by rote, as it tends to lead to following such memorised sequences blindly, getting them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutGambitted">Out-Gambitted</a> by, for example, getting influence in the wrong direction.
</li></ul></li><li> This is a common idea in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones">Game of Thrones</a></em> Board Game in general
<ul><li> The Roose Bolton card does this. He boosts your armies so you might win, but if you lose, you can return him and all your other hero cards to your hand.
</li><li> When one side has a very slight advantage and both players have a grip of a bunch of Hero cards, the leading side will often play a mid-range card in an attempt to bait out a high-power card out of the opponent. If the opponent does, then the leading side does not have to worry about the high power card for later and may not even suffer casualties depending on which House was involved (especially a problem with Stark during 1st Edition). If the opponent doesn't, you still haven't committed many resources and gotten victory in the battle.

<ul><li> Frequently the primary style behind the Scorpion Clan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/LegendOfTheFiveRings">Legend of the Five Rings</a></em>, both in game mechanics and in storyline, consist of losing to win. Attacking them politically means they indulge in slander and blackmail; attacking them militarily means they lay horrific traps and pull you into impossible wars all the while. This has proven to be a catch-22 for the writers, as it's a Wall Banger if the clan doesn't salvage anything from a defeat, and if they're never truly defeated. They're also notorious for claiming everything is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustAsPlanned">Just as Planned</a>, even unambiguous defeats.
</li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Bridge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Bridge">Bridge</a>, with the number of different varieties of coups, endplays, and the like, it's quite possible to make sure you make your contract (or your opponents lose their contract) no matter what is played, despite said contract appearing to be hopeless (or completely solid). The most common variety would be the endplay (by intentionally losing a trick to opponents, you force an opponent to give you at least two more tricks due to lack of leads), but the squeeze play (where an opponent is forced to discard too many cards, allowing their good cards to be easily captured) and the coup (generally a play to force a foe into promoting one of your other cards) also frequently work like this. The defense can also pull these off, although generally not as easily.
</li><li> Depending on cards and archetype, this is often the goal in a game of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>. Decks in modern <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> tend to focus on a singular strategy that can account for a number of potential attacks or moves by your opponent, and certain archetypes use your opponents moves. A Skull Servant deck wants its monsters to be destroyed and placed in the graveyard. Your opponent needs to destroy your monsters to win, but in doing so powers your other monsters (in particular the King of Skull Servant). If they leave them alone to stall your moves, they could risk you summoning something extremely dangerous that may not be reliant on your active strategy, but exists for this scenario. It's a lose-lose situation, and the only way out is to simultaneously destroy a monster <em>and</em> get it banished rather than just regular destroyed. This is not impossible to do, but had your deck not been set up to counter this exact potential moment, you are in a serious risk of failing to recover or gain traction against your opponent.

Ah, but there's more to it than that. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">The success or failure of the Nano-mite attack was irrelevant to the long-term plan. All that matters was that it was launched, providing an opportunity to get the President of the USA (the "world's most powerful man") into a position where he could be replaced by a doppelganger (who is probably still under the Commander's control, even if he thinks that he isn't). Now that this has been done, scaring up a terrorist threat large enough to justify seizing extraordinary powers should be child's play. Which leads on to the next stage of the plan - if Joe remain oblivious, Zartan will be in a position to cripple them, and if they find out and attempt to remove him, the attempt could easily be portrayed as a military coup, which would cause their allies to turn on them.

If the U.S. became independent, the Declaration would become an artefact of national importance, any measures put in place by the Freemasons to protect it would seem reasonable, and the treasure would remain in Masonic hands.

</li><li> This is used to humorous effect in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePrincessBride">The Princess Bride</a></em>, where Westley and Vizzini play a game of wits: Vizzini has to guess which goblet Westley has poisoned and select one to drink, Westley being forced to drink from the other one. After Vizzini has (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IKnowYouKnowIKnow">with much complicated exposition</a>) made his choice and drunk, Westley reveals that both the goblets are poisoned and that he has a resistance to that particular poison.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars">Star Wars</a></em>:
<ul><li> Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine attempts this. There are two Skywalkers: one's already his apprentice but he's more machine than man now, which limits his abilities in the Force; the other is young and idealistic and a potential threat. So he tries to tempt Luke to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a> with a duel with his father. If Luke wins, he gets an upgraded apprentice; if not, he's rid of a potential threat and Darth Vader's loyalty no longer has another possible recipient. It doesn't work, however, as Luke refuses to turn to the dark side. Sidious then tries to kill Luke, but that doesn't work either because Vader is still capable of throwing the Emperor off a balcony.
</li><li> Obi-Wan is polite enough to warn Vader that "if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine" before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObiWanMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObiWanMoment">setting Vader up to do just that</a>. On the other hand, if Vader did not strike him down, he would leave Obi-Wan free to kill him.
</li><li> Sidious's plan in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace">The Phantom Menace</a></em> is a Xanatos Gambit—at the start of the film he wants the Trade Federation to hold Queen Amidala prisoner; when she escapes, he sends his apprentice, Darth Maul, to prevent her from reaching Coruscant. But Amidala does reach Coruscant, and within a couple hours she's helped Sidious become Chancellor Palpatine.
</li><li> The entire prequel trilogy of <em>Star Wars</em> is one by Sidious: he controls both sides in the Clone Wars (the Republic as Chancellor Palpatine, the Separatists as Darth Sidious) so whichever side wins, the Jedi will be destroyed, he will become Emperor, and he will have a powerful Sith apprentice (Count Dooku or Darth Vader: this is decided—possibly along with the outcome of the entire war—by their duel at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheSith">Revenge of the Sith</a></em>). This was planned as well, with Palpatine convincing Dooku to defeat Kenobi while losing to Anakin, thereby allowing the two to convert Anakin to the dark side. Dooku doesn't realize until too late that Sidious <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">means to replace him if he loses</a>, instead of just recruiting Anakin as an enforcer.
</li><li> Obi-Wan's mission to kill General Grievous is described as one of these (as well as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UriahGambit">Uriah Gambit</a>) in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RevengeOfTheSith">the novelization</a>. Obi-Wan succeeds and kills Grievous? That's one less pawn that Palpatine would otherwise have to dispose of later. Grievous kills Obi-Wan? One less Jedi in Palpatine's way. The end result of the battle is irrelevant; the entire point is to make sure Obi-Wan isn't on Coruscant, where he would otherwise likely be able to stop Anakin from turning to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDarkSide">The Dark Side</a>.
</li><li> It's entirely plausible that Leia and Luke were set up for one by Obi-Wan and Yoda. You have Palpatine and Vader, the two remaining Sith. You also have the Rule of Two that means there's <em>only</em> two Sith at a given time. So, hide Leia with an ally and put Luke in plain sight on his dad's homeworld. If Vader and Palpatine avoid Tatooine, Obi-Wan is there to train the boy as a weapon against his father when he comes of age. If Vader went after Luke, Palpatine would attack Vader. If Palpatine went after Luke? Well, Vader has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> about family members and would attack Palpatine. Either way, you would end up with one dead Sith one (likely) badly-wounded Sith, and (worst-case) a half-trained Luke, who could be turned back or killed by bringing out their ace in the hole over on Alderaan, who was given most of a conventional Jedi education already.
</li><li> In an unusual variation, Qui-Gon sets one up for Watto at his own expense in order to convince him to let him borrow his slave Anakin Skywalker and sponsor him in the podrace. "If we win, you keep all our winnings, minus the cost of the parts we need [to fix the ship's hyperdrive]; if we lose, you keep my ship." Nearly averted in the novelization where Watto has trouble believing such a generous offer, but since he can't find a downside, he ends up agreeing to it.
</li><li> Palpatine pulls this again in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRiseOfSkywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></em>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">his body is very heavily deteriorated, but he needed Rey alive because she could undergo a ritual where she could <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrikeMeDownWithAllOfYourHatred" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrikeMeDownWithAllOfYourHatred">Strike Him Down With All Of Her Hatred</a> and his spirit could enter a younger body. When she instead passes a lightsaber to the redeemed Kylo Ren and he comes onto the scene to help her, Palpatine reveals he can drain the energy of a diad in the Force, taking life energy from Rey and Kylo to heal himself instead. He didn't even really need Rey to kill him, as long as there was also the possibility of finding a way to get himself healed</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Narrowly averted but still lampshaded in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorOfMechagodzilla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerrorOfMechagodzilla">Terror of Mechagodzilla</a></em>. When Dr. Mafune releases Titanosaurus to attack Tokyo against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Mugal</a>'s wishes, Godzilla comes to battle his monster. Rather than get angry as he does in his appearances, Mugal insists that he and his forces do nothing. If Titanosaurus wins, Godzilla would be killed in battle and it'd be easier for his plan of World Domination to go through, and even if Godzilla won and killed Titanosaurus, Godzilla would've been too banged up to stand up to Mechagodzilla, who would kill him too. It would've worked, if <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasLovedOnes">Katsura</a> wasn't shot and killed <em>again</em>, and Dr. Mafune didn't call Titanosaurus back before his fight with Godzilla could get brutal.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tron">TRON</a> used as an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EstablishingCharacterMoment">Establishing Character Moment</a> for Alan Bradley.

<ol><li> Alan is allowed to complete Tron and run the software. Master Control's scheme and Dillinger's shady dealings get exposed. Both of them are shut down - Alan wins.
</li><li> If Dillinger fired Alan without letting him complete Tron, it would draw the attention of Walter Gibbs, who would likely investigate (especially given Alan submitted all the necessary paperwork with the i's dotted and t's crossed), which would likely expose Dillinger and Master Control's scheming. Alan still wins.
</li><li> Tron is deleted and Alan is not fired. There is nothing stopping Alan from having another try, and it would <em>also</em> get Gibbs's attention. Again, Alan wins.
</li><li> The only scenario that wasn't planned for was the one in the movie; Master Control steps up the timetable to take over both sides of the Cold War and blackmails Dillinger into compliance, while Alan and Lora recruit Flynn, who proves to be a <em>massive</em> distraction for Master Control, gets Tron free, and the whole thing shuts down anyway.

<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible">The Bible</a>:
<ul><li> The overarching plot of the Bible (at least according to mainstream Christian interpretations). Adam sinned by deciding humans could decide for themselves what was good or evil, "tainting" all future humans (which, since he and Eve were the First, is ALL humanity) with sin and death, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> gives himself to counter-act this, the life of a perfect man (Adam) for the life of a perfect man (Jesus). Afterwards, everything is basically a Xanatos Gambit by God against Satan. Satan and the wicked have dominion over the earth and can (have, and will) persecute God's true followers and will attempt to destroy them. This could go several ways. 1) If the "wicked" have good hearts, no matter what, they will be called and welcomed to God's followers. Satan loses, Jehovah wins. 2) The wicked try to ignore God's people and continue ruling themselves. They are unable to successfully rule themselves, as God had predicted, and they will be removed from power. Satan loses, Jehovah wins. 3) The wicked and hard-hearted attempt to destroy God's followers. Prophesies are fulfilled, a battle at Armageddon begins, they are destroyed, the good-hearted are heralded into an eternity of happiness in a paradise earth, Satan and his demons are imprisoned and eventually destroyed, resolving the issue of sovereignty once and for all and ending in the destruction of all evil for all time. Satan loses, Jehovah wins. This comes across in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLionTheWitchAndTheWardrobe">The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</a></em>.

That way, he ensure that either he gets to keep Benjamin with him (if his brothers treat Benjamin like a dispensable family member, as they treated Joseph years ago), or his brothers show a sufficient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterArc">Character Arc</a> by refusing to leave Benjamin in Egypt, in which case he reconciles with all of them and brings his entire clan over to Egypt.

</li><li> They're considered a defining feature for Mephistopheles. After a failed rebellion against Asmodeus, the master of all the Nine Hells, Mephistopheles sat in his throne in the frozen Eighth Hell of Cania and went completely still and silent for years — so long that a powerful devil named Baron Molikroth slowly swayed many of Mephistopheles's court away over old Mephisto's neglect. The traitorous courtiers came to the court to depose Mephistopheles... only for Molikroth to reveal he had <em>always</em> been Mephistopheles and the immobile double on the throne was a fake. So his loyal subordinates were proven loyal and the disloyal element was tricked into exposing themselves for a purge.

Another runner investigated and discovered that the <em>entire run</em> he bragged about was a setup: the rest of the hand-picked team had done jobs against Saeder-Krupp subsidiaries (and thus Lofwyr had incentive to kill them), the target facility was owned by S-K through shell companies and was insured against theft, the paydata was garbage (so Shiawase wasted time and money analyzing it), and probably got to field-test a device for controlling <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanisMajor">fenrir</a> against them.

If he should accidentally unleash this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Eldritch Abomination</a> and unravel all of Creation in the process, the gods can then remake the world — but this time around, the Dark One would have a say in how the goblins were treated. Then again, even without the plan, the gods still need the Dark One - because he's a being that rose to godhood of his own volition and wasn't one of the four original pantheons, he has a unique <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColourCodedForYourConvenience">color of creation</a>, meaning that he's absolutely necessary to seal the rifts even without Redcloak's intervention</span>.

The point is that in becoming an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord">Evil Overlord</a>, he gets to rule for his time before a hero defeats him, and if one does, he'll be remembered as a cool epic villain. However, he doesn't account for a death that isn't witnessed by anyone, like dying of exposure while lost in the desert, or for simply not dying at <em>all</em> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoEnding">being unwillingly ejected from the plot without another word</a>, ultimately making this a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted Trope</a>.

By the midpoint of the chapter <em>Monster</em> a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GambitPileup">Gambit Pileup</a> seems inevitable.

To whit, his plan was: Bait Nanase into attacking him first. Not-Tengu believed Guardian Forms can only be used in self defense. If she isn't defending herself, she can't use it and he's free to form his flock without any worries. If she manages to use her Guardian Form anyway, still not a problem. Not-Tengu doesn't know her other spells, any of which could potentially beat him, but Guardian Forms locks all of those out for at least a day due to burnout. And while she is in Guardian Form, she can only fight in hand to hand combat, something he has no problem with. What ultimately derails his plan was not being able to actually catch the much faster Nanase and her girlfriend while both where in Guardian Form, followed by burning through the area's ambient magic causing himself to fall out the sky.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/BobAndGeorge">Bob and George</a></em>, Wily's <a class="urllink" href="http://www.bobandgeorge.com/archives/010801">original plan for Zero<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a Xanatos Gambit: he designed the Maverick Virus to jump from Zero if he were ever defeated, infecting whatever hero defeated him. (Wily assumed this would be a Light-bot; it turned out to be Sigma, but the results speak for themselves.) This was a canon-compliant theory at the time. Since then, a lot of confusing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> has come down, and it's no longer clear what Wily put the Maverick Virus in or if he even created it.

<ul><li> Given a bit of insight in "Ayla and the Birthday Brawl" chapter 11, Ayla tells a minor character the truth on a detail. He then gives a little inner monologue on how this helps. Either it disarms the person, or he gains crucial details. Whatever happens, he gets out ahead.
</li><li> Supervillain Dr. Diabolik uses this in all his Evil Plans. His MO is to use his 'mind web' to take over a mid-sized city. If the heroes fail to defeat him, he walks off with all the goods of the entire town. If the heroes break through the power of the mind web, he still gets everything his forces have stolen by then, plus he achieves his real goal: he 'awakens' thousands of ordinary people and makes them more 'aware', furthering his goal of increasing human intelligence. He will actually cheer on the heroes when they succeed, all while playing an automated 'villainous monologue' program over the PA system to make it look like he's being, well, villainous.
