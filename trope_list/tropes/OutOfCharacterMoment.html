</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the original Japanese version of the Duelist Kingdom arc, Yami Bakura wanted Mokuba so he could take the keys to controlling Kaiba Corporation. This is especially strange considering Yami Bakura is obsessed with acquiring dark magical power and artifacts and shouldn't be expected to care about a company or money. The English dub changed his motive to the more plausible "use Mokuba as a new host body".
</li><li> It happens to Kaiba in a filler episode, Kaiba is just getting ready to fire some of his business associates for <em>trying to kill him</em> when they tell him that he should test out their new virtual simulator. Kaiba agrees and says he'll fire them AFTER testing out the trap... er, I mean, game. You can guess what happens.
</li><li> Lampshaded in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/YuGiOhTheAbridgedSeries">Abridged Series</a>.</em>
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Kaiba:</strong> I instantly forgive you.
</div><div class="indent"><strong>Mokuba:</strong> Wait, big brother, why are you acting so out of character?
</div><ul><li> That was actually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubInducedPlotHole">Dub-Induced Plot Hole</a>. In the original, they make a deal with Kaiba — he plays the game they invented. If he wins, they're fired; if he loses, they stay. Kaiba even notes that he <em>knows</em> it's a trap, but he has to play anyway or they'll try to get revenge later. It's still a nice holding of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall">Idiot Ball</a> (they would get revenge either way), but Kaiba is known for never refusing challenges, so it wasn't so OOC.
</li><li> Some fans and even characters might consider Kaiba <em>cheering</em> for Yugi a little out of character.
</li><li> Invoked in universe in the duel with Strings. Yami demonstrates caution by not attacking, despite his normally more bold/reckless style of play. It turns out he was guessing the opponent's strategy and knew they wanted him to attack, and so set up a counter play of his own.
</li><li> In the Battle City semi-finals, Yami's strategy for defeating Bakura's Destiny Board/Dark Sanctuary lockdown strategy involves using Collected Power to force the Ghost of Dark Sanctuary to possess his Kuriboh, and then destroy Kuriboh using Exile of the Wicked; in effect, he has to kill his own monster on purpose. It is feasible that he'd be willing to do this (he was in a Shadow Duel against a demon who had threatened to kill him and his friends before, and <em>this</em> time, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactOfDoom">Osiris</a> was being wagered) but Yami's indifferent reaction to it was <em>really</em> out of character seeing how he scolded Rebecca for treating monsters like that and <em>condemned</em> Arkana for such actions in previous episodes. (Not to mention that he was visibly upset about having to do it in the manga version of the story.)

Arguably, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Livio</span> had an OoC moment in his "I now realize I love kids!" speech.

Of course, Fugenberch was effectively <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedByCanon">Doomed by Canon</a> anyway...

There had been no indication before then that Alphonse would react this way to <em>anything</em>, and no foreshadowing that showed his existence being in question in the first place. It pretty much takes a heartfelt speech <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GetAHoldOfYourselfMan">with help from</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWhack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrenchWhack">a monkey wrench</a> from Winry to turn Alphonse right back into his previous characterization, never behaving that way again.
<ul><li> This is avoided in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a> by way of building up the issues that Barry brings up for a bit before Al deals with him (although, in both versions, Ed makes the mistake of being about to ask Al a difficult question and then backing down), and then having Al feel the effects of it for a far longer time than in the manga/Brotherhood. He also has several more <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakOut">freak outs</a> over the course of the series, making them part of his overall characterization.
</li><li> The 2003 anime also has one in the fillery fourth episode when Ed seems to break his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill">Thou Shalt Not Kill</a> principles, albeit by accident, and doesn't react much to it. This is given a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave">Hand Wave</a> in a later episode. And then later he's <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">responsible for killing Greed—also pretty much by accident—but he has an appropriately devastated response, and, after some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, he manages to kill Sloth as well</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em>, Vegeta spends most of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonSerialMovie">first Broly movie</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD">too scared to fight</a>, simply because Broly "is the legendary Super Saiyan", and that means they have no chance to win. This is the same Vegeta who spends every spare moment either bargaining for more power or picking the hardest fights he can to exercise said power. Years later he'd act the same way when confronted with the God of Destruction Beerus...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">until Beerus slaps his wife Bulma</a>, at which point all bets were off.
<ul><li> Chi-Chi after the Saiyan Saga is completely neglectful of Goku, caring nothing for his health and only showed concern for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBelovedSmother">Gohan.</a> This is what fans <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">best remember her for</a> despite this being the only occurrence of that and the fact that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs">Played for Laughs</a>.
</li><li> Additionally, in the Majin Buu saga, she, previously shown to be an overbearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EducationMama">Education Mama</a>, tells Gohan to skip school and train for the World Martial Arts tournament. Also played for laughs and lampshaded by Gohan. The prize money of ten million zeni <em>probably</em> had something to do with it.
</li><li> Gohan has a couple of moments like this, both during critical fights and both causing major problems. When he achieved Super Saiyan 2, he acted uncharacteristically bloodthirsty and malicious, refusing to end the fight because he wanted Cell to suffer<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1ccmm');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1ccmm" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1ccmm');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">There is actually a precedent for this: It had been previously established that Super Saiyan forms reinforce one's latent Saiyan traits, including battle-lust and cruelty; when Goku first transformed while fighting Freeza, he ordered Gohan to get to safety while he was still in full control of himself</span>; this resulted in Goku having to do a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a> to keep Cell from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingYouWithMe">self-destructing and destroying the planet</a>. Years later during the Buu Saga, the Elder Supreme Kai unlocks Gohan's full potential and he gets overly cocky while fighting Super Buu; as a result of him not finishing the fight when he had the opportunity, he got absorbed by Buu and was later killed, though this could be blamed on Gohan's lack of fighting instincts.
</li><li> Vegeta flying into a rage against Cell did no damage and resulted in Gohan getting an arm injured <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">Taking the Bullet</a> for Vegeta. Vegeta actually acknowledges he was only a liability and even apologizes to Gohan for it. Gohan even takes it as a sign that things are hopeless.

One would expect her going "Ara, ara~" in the background instead of turning violent like the rest of the crew (minus Houki, who is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">being dragged by the hand by Ichika</span>).
</li><li> In the second season of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackButler">Kuroshitsuji</a></em>, Aleister Chamber faints at the sight of blood, despite being a doctor and being arrested for illegal organ trade in the first season.
<ul><li> Also a pretty obvious example of Flanderisation. Season two didn't follow the manga and pretty much all the characters had at least a few moments of wild OOC-ness.

Luffy wears an afro wig in the fight against Foxy. As usual, Nami finds this ridiculously stupid. The rest of the crew think it's awesome. Even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Robin</a>. However, the way she says it is consistent with her character. It seems like she just has an unusual fondness for afros.
<ul><li> During one of the television specials "Protect! The Last Great Performance" the crew joins the players after several actors quit, you may expect overacting and goofiness from Usopp and Luffy, who is running around in a monkey costume, however <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">Nico Robin</a> is seen goofing and overacting as well!

This is lampshaded by another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">"normal"</a> character, Gasser.
<ul><li> Beauty acts weird in one episode for no apparent reason. She all of the sudden starts treating Gasser with absolutely no respect, and cries emotionally at seeing a creepy man get birthed out of a dragon egg, when she would normally be screaming and questioning what's going on.

Dororo is normally the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> of the group, staying calm, focused, and level headed around the others, even despite knowing about the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that people often forget he's even there.

This is in contrast with the main series, where Rias and Akeno are actually very naughty themselves, Asia is shy but doesn't mind Issei being like that, and only Koneko complains about the perversion, but even then she <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass">just becomes ruder</a> and she <em>still</em> won't hit him! To put it in perspective, in one episode all the girls but Koneko were cool with <em>bathing nude</em> with Issei. It's like they picked a generic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice">fanservice</a> script and put the show's cast on it.
<ul><li> Seems to have been an issue in the first special episode only, as following ones play out like normal episodes of the show, including Akeno simply giving a "My, my" to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> being a test subject for Issei's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNudifier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNudifier">Dress Break</a></span>.

However, neither one is particularly good at acting, and most of their friends note that they are acting odd (Asuka is bad at hiding her emotions, while Shinji often forgets to stay in character).

One of said warriors is their leader, Megatron. Now, it's perfectly in-character for Starscream to jump at the chance to off Megatron and assume leadership, but while this is going on, <em>Soundwave</em>, Megatron's faithful lieutenant, just stands by and watches. Note that, earlier on, Soundwave stopped to help an injured Megatron up from the battlefield, when the others had left him for dead. This happens for the sake of the plot: Megatron would have to be tossed out, so that he can encounter Unicron, thus enabling him to be reformatted into Galvatron.
<ul><li> Allegedly the Decepticons' battle for leadership would have been more developed in the original screenplay. Soundwave would have had his Out-of-Character Moment explained, planning solely on using his role as leader to order Astrotrain to go back for Megatron.

Then at the end of the movie she decides to flash an entire stadium of onlookers to prove that she is a girl so that her love interest will possibly like her, and to show that she was a separate person from her brother, whose identity she was using to sneak into the school's athletic team and happened to be taken on the team as a result (and when he was accused of being her at the time, he dropped his pants to prove otherwise).

Andy takes the blame to cover for Jay but then responds with an obscenity filled rant that is wildly out of character for the normally mild mannered Andy. In-universe it may have been intended to sell the story and make it more believable.
<ul><li> And later in the movie he verbally lashes out at his friends for hiring a cross-dressing prostitute to have sex with him.

This is because that's exactly what happened. They did switch the characters' dialog from what was more in-character because, for some reason, it just wasn't flowing correctly that way.

<ul><li> Also when the Autobots are hiding from Sam's parents, Optimus Prime would have been more careful not to break anything. His line "Sorry, my bad", after he steps on a fountain, has caused a particularly furious fan backlash because it went against his usual serious, dramatic speech pattern.

David the android is the worst example, although the Captain, Charlie, Vickers, and Fifield and Millburn, etc. all act in ways that severely contradict their earlier actions in the movie. David hinders and helps the crew with no real understandable motivation to his actions, although even the friendly captain acts in ways that seem like he is deliberately attempting to kill his own crew.

And yet in one scene, he suddenly begins to wax philosophical and highly educated stuff in his speech about how if everybody's in on it, he would be too (due to the director Christof feeding him lines). While it's highly emotional and artistic, to both Truman and the audience, it sounds all <em>wrong</em> for the character to say such things. It only highlights how poorly-written and contrived the idea of bringing Truman's father back into the show was.

</li><li> This tends to crop up amongst the characters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight">Twilight</a></em> series. One notable example is when Edward decides in <em>New Moon</em> that he is too dangerous to be around Bella, after <em>Jasper</em> nearly attacks her. It was just in the last book that Edward's response to Bella being in danger was to stalk her from the bushes, and claimed that he would "let the chips fall where they may" in regards to her being in danger of being eaten by him.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfThrones">A Game of Thrones</a></em>:
<ul><li> Jorah Mormont gives a famous monologue to Daenerys about how the commoners don't really care about who rules them: they just want to be left alone to pursue their lives unmolested by the nobility, who seldom give them that reprieve. Said comment was by a man who shows little concern to the lives of innocents later throughout the series, whether they're being raped, tortured, enslaved or killed. It comes across as George RR Martin wanting to make a political point for the readers and Daenerys both, and Jorah was the person <em>closest</em> to saying something of this nature (as opposed to Viserys or the Dothraki).
</li><li> Many of Catelyn Stark's actions in the books are driven by the fact that her sister Lysa sent her a brief coded message that the Lannisters were responsible for the murder of Jon Arryn, including encouraging Ned to take the position of King's Hand and later kidnapping Tyrion Lannister. For the latter event, she even thinks about how she wants to get more information from her sister. And then, despite spending several <em>weeks</em> with her sister with little else to do, never asks her about it, and even ponders how odd it is that Lysa changed her story from Cersei being responsible to Tyrion being the killer. She never once says anything like, "You told me the Lannisters were responsible for Jon's death, and war is looking imminent. Please let me know what evidence you have for the Lannister's involvement for the murder because we are all in dire circumstances." The reason she never says anything like this or asks for more details from Lysa is because that would break the plot, because Lysa <em>doesn't have any evidence</em>.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SeptimusHeap">Septimus Heap</a></em>: In most of the books, Septimus Heap is usually the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a> and very cautious. In <em>Darke</em>, however, he blatantly disregards a warning from Jenna about something that is going on in the Palace. It doesn't end well.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnightAndRogueSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KnightAndRogueSeries">Knight and Rogue Series</a></em>, after having been held captive and experimented on by Lady Ceciel, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncorruptiblePurePureness">Michael</a> gets a little too much joy out destroying her life's work and drugging her. He even pulls out the tool she used to force feed him and starts mimicking the threats she made.
</li><li> Principal Chapman in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Animorphs">Animorphs</a></em> novel <em>The Andalite Chronicles</em>. In the main series Chapman is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PapaWolf">Papa Wolf</a> who's so devoted to protecting his daughter he has willingly surrendered himself to a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> to spare her from that fate. Despite knowing Chapman's motives, the Animorphs still regularly make him their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey">Butt-Monkey</a>, targeting him for hostage situations and the like. But Chapman's tragic backstory goes completely out the window in <em>The Andalite Chronicles</em>, which makes use of a younger Chapman as a dangerous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">turncoat</a> who is willing to sell out <em>his entire race</em> in exchange for his own safety. Effectively, this takes Chapman from a man willing to sacrifice everything for his loved ones to a man who is willing to sacrifice everyone to save himself.
</li><li> Sandry near the start of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CircleOfMagic">Will of the Empress</a></em>. Tris is forced to save the Trader caravan they're traveling with from a flash flood and starts throwing around lightning to get people and horses to <em>move</em> when they're not fast enough. Sandry is absolutely furious with her for being so high-handed—while not noticing that Tris is pale and sweating, even though all of the Circle kids know (from personal experience, no less) that doing big magic like that leaves you drained and ignoring the fact that Tris just saved <em>everyone's</em> lives. Sandry is called out by the caravan leader for being so insensitive. It shows how much the Circle has fallen apart since they went a-traveling. It's also <em>weird</em> from Sandry, a sweet girl who was taught by Lark (the kindest, most patient teacher) and emulated Lark's teaching style with her own student and who was described by Briar as being "too understanding," <em>and</em> who is sensible and diplomatic enough that Duke Vedris wants to make her his heir.
</li><li> Blackstar from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats">Warrior Cats</a></em> temporarily acts nice in "The Fourth Apprentice". Lionblaze asks in a snarky tone "Who are you, and what've you done to Blackstar?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChronoHustle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChronoHustle">Chrono Hustle</a></em> Jack tends to try talking his way out of problems whenever possible. So when he doesn't even try to do so at the start of the sixth story, Mary is understandably confused.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Madicken" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Madicken">Madicken</a></em>:
<ul><li> Madicken is normally a loving older sister to Lisabet. But occasionally, she's a jerk to Lisabet for no other reason than that being a jerk suddenly amuses her. Then again, this is probably meant to only be typical sibling bickering. And just a minute or so later, the two sisters will be playing together again as if nothing unusual has happened.
</li><li> Similarly, it is clear that Madicken is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledSweet">Spoiled Sweet</a> and mostly a really compassionate person for her young age. But still, she did call her poverty-stricken classmate Mia "Louse Mia" once. She only did that though after having been harassed by Mia for a long time. And still, she would regret it later and eventually became friends with Mia.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAddamsFamily">The Addams Family</a></em> had the episode "Cousin Itt and the Vocational Counselor". In it, the Addams parents were wanting to make Itt into a marriage therapist and they pretended to be a bickering couple, but then Morticia gets angry and thinks Gomez's acting is how he really feels. This is out of character in itself, but usually, on the rare occasions it happens, Morticia just cries while Gomez reassures her he's not like that and she perks up instantly and apologises. In this episode, however, Morticia is <em>still</em> angry even after Gomez's reassuring her, even to the point of her <em>throwing</em> things at Gomez and him sleeping on the couch. They do make up the next day, but she still calls him a "cad", implying she's still not convinced he wasn't just acting. To top it all off, she was previously the one who had to remind <em>Gomez</em> that they were acting, not the other way round. There's also the line she says when they're making up: "I was a fool for sending you out in your bare feet without a thought to your sinuses", which is out of character because they're both <em>Addamses</em> and in case you didn't know, the Addams family all <em>like</em> gloomy weather and are generally immune from sickness.
</li></ul><ul><li> In the miniseries of the rebooted <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003">Battlestar Galactica</a></em>, Laura Roslin demonstrates her loyalty to humanity by ordering her (unarmed) ship to stay and assist refugees even when two Cylon Raiders approach. Thanks to Apollo's quick thinking, they manage to survive the encounter. However, later on when the situation is repeated she orders the fleet to jump away rather than risk total destruction, giving her character quite a bit of guilt but saving humanity. The writer Ron Moore even confirmed in a blog post that he wanted to spend a scene showing her reconsider her actions earlier as foolish, but due to time constraints those scenes were never filmed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad">Breaking Bad</a></em> there are two such moments from Mike; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">when a little boy is shot by one of the men working under him, he's perfectly accepting of it, and even shoots down the idea of having the shooter killed. Even more jarring is in his final episode, he abandons his beloved granddaughter and leaves her alone at the park so he can escape the police. The actor playing Mike, Jonathan Banks, particularly objected to the second example and felt it was extremely out of character given how much Mike loves his granddaughter, but went along with it out of respect for the writers</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em>:
<ul><li> At the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E1WhenSheWasBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E1WhenSheWasBad">season two</a>, Buffy's behavior changes in response to the trauma of her near-death at the hands of the Master; she is sullen, actively lashes out at people, and flirts with Xander purely to upset Angel (and hurts Xander and Willow as a result).
</li><li> In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E15Phases" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS2E15Phases">Phases</a>", Giles is explaining that the full moon brings out the darkest in people, and Xander quips, "And yet, ironically, led to the invention of the moon pie." Rather than snapping at Xander, which is what he <em>always</em> does, Giles <em>giggles appreciatively!</em> This is probably a deliberate use of the trope; the joke is that having spent a year deriding Xander's impertinence, he finds the humour in this <em>singularly lame</em> remark. (He's the only one, by the way.) Giles' unusual behavior in this episode also reflects his unusual mood — he is excited at the opportunity to encounter and research a werewolf, which he refers to as "one of the classics."
</li><li> In a presumably less intentional example, in the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E7FoolForLove" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E7FoolForLove">Fool For Love</a>", when Riley is prowling the cemetery for vampires while Buffy is injured, he brings along Willow, Xander, and Anya, who instead of using their long experience to help him, chatter, crunch on chips loudly, don't take cover, and generally act like stupid muggle amateurs. Even though Willow and Xander at least not only saved the slayer's ass numerous times and dealt with vampires for five years, but actually <em>hunted them without Buffy for an entire summer</em>, with a 60% success rate. They never had and never would act like that again, and presumably were only played that way to make Riley, who many fans consider <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">The Scrappy</a>, look good. Alternatively, it made Riley look overly militarized, as opposed to the generally more laid-back Scoobies.
</li><li> Same episode, Drusilia is known to be crazy, psychotic, almost inhumanly so. During a flashback however she questions Spike on why he can't kill Buffy, and realizing that he loves her acts like any human would: angry and upset but not resorting to violence like a vamp, disappointed, and perfectly sane in describing how hurt she is.
</li><li> The episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E15IWasMadeToLoveYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS5E15IWasMadeToLoveYou">I Was Made To Love You</a>" featured several characters acting out of character — Anya makes a deliberate effort not to be jealous around Xander, Tara surprises everyone by swearing, and it is probably the first time we see Willow openly checking out another girl. This was deliberate on the writer's part, as the theme of the episode was women attempting to change themselves.
</li><li> A really painful example in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E18DirtyGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BuffyTheVampireSlayerS7E18DirtyGirls">Dirty Girls</a>" — Faith (formerly evil Slayer on path to redemption), returns to Sunnydale and sees Spike (in full vamp mode) chasing after what appears to be a helpless woman. When Faith tries to stop him, Buffy defends Spike, and it's apparent that this is all a set-up for Faith to wonder if she suddenly became the good Slayer and Buffy became the evil one. After some resolution dialogue, Faith finds out that the woman is actually a vampire running from Spike.

For instance, he is very much an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero">Action Hero</a> in it, and willing to use fists at first opportunity, the same thing the Leela era (when he has a warrior as a companion) makes a very big thing out of him <em>not</em> doing. He also uses <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WigDressAccent">Wig, Dress, Accent</a> to infiltrate a mansion, even though the Fourth Doctor had very little skill at disguises and tended to prefer force of personality and charm (one of the things that separated him from Three, who used secret identities, and Two, who was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterActor">a chameleon</a>). This is all because the script was adapted from a script for <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAvengers1960s">The Avengers (1960s)</a></em> by an <em>Avengers</em> writer. Tom Baker felt the story was out of character, and insisted on playing it as if the Doctor was genuinely terrified of the monster, in order to make the violence feel justified.
</li><li> The tie-in audio drama "Doctor Who and the Pescatons" is notorious for this. The writer had mainly worked on Second Doctor stories ("<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E6FuryFromTheDeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E6FuryFromTheDeep">Fury from the Deep</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E1TheTombOfTheCybermen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS5E1TheTombOfTheCybermen">The Tomb of the Cybermen</a>"), so the Fourth Doctor is written with the quirk of always playing the piccolo in times of stress (an echo of the Second Doctor's gimmick of playing the recorder badly). This, however, pales in comparison to the fact that the story shows the Doctor and Sarah Jane committing a genocide of an (apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a>) alien race and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuiltFreeExterminationWar">showing absolutely no remorse or conflict about it whatsoever</a>.

Generally portrayed as a silly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit">Rebellious Spirit</a> with little respect for social mores, a hatred of violence and a desire to rise above his environment, in "Weng-Chiang" he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangedMyJumper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangedMyJumper">dresses sans scarf</a> (in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeCostumeReference" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WholeCostumeReference">Whole Costume Reference</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>) and becomes surly, violent and authoritarian. He barely looks at Leela, except for when he's trying to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionPlot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionPlot">Pygmalion Plot</a> to convert her into an ideal Victorian woman, and constantly tries to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen">push her away</a> despite how capable he is (telling her to "wait there" so many times that it became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShallowParody">Shallow Parody</a> joke of the show from this storyline alone). He immediately jumps to the conclusion that he needs to kill a mutated creature with a rifle instead of considering a peaceful solution, and when he gets his hands on the gun he coos over its workmanship in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PatrioticFervor">rather imperialist</a> terms. He actually tries to call the Police to deal with the villains for him at one point, and makes bigoted jokes at the expense of the Chinese. He is also unnecessarily rude to Litefoot, vandalising his furniture, taking advantage of his Victorian politeness, and yelling at him. It is unclear why this is, as the story was written by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertHolmes">Robert Holmes</a>, the writer who created the Fourth Doctor's character; he may have been writing the Doctor as a parody of Sherlock Holmes to support the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pastiche" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pastiche">Pastiche</a> tone of the story, trusting that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomBaker">Tom Baker</a> would be able to play it to make it feel like the Doctor (Baker, who normally hated any stories where the Doctor was violent, was a big fan of the <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> books and loved the opportunity to play Holmes so much that he had no interest in trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WagTheDirector">Wag the Director</a>). There is also some suggestion that it was a new characterisation that was being floated for later showrunners, or for a potential Season 15 under <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipHinchcliffe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PhilipHinchcliffe">Philip Hinchcliffe</a>; the Fourth Doctor's personality had been gradually becoming less silly and more Gothic and Victorian over the course of Hinchcliffe's run, and the scarfless costume from this story was being talked about as a permanent new outfit for later seasons. Either way, it didn't stick, since he's back to being silly and kind next season.
</li><li> During the final scene of "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E16TheWatersOfMars">The Waters of Mars</a>", the Tenth Doctor shows a very selfish side unlike his usual compassionate attitude. He argues with Adelaide that he gets to decide who's important and who's not, who gets to live and die, and calls himself a winner in a tone similar to how the famous Charlie Sheen calls himself a winner. When Adelaide calls him out saying he's wrong, he simply replies, "That's for me to decide." This is portrayed as what the Doctor is like if he's both wracked with guilt and loneliness for a long time and left without a companion to regulate him. By the end he's given a sharp wake up call about just how OOC he's being and it's the start of him realizing that he needs to regenerate because he's becoming dangerously prideful from being 10 for so long. Made even more alarming when you realize that, at the time of his regeneration, 10 lived less than a decade. As the Eleventh Doctor would later put it, he had "vanity issues" which caused him an abnormal amount of attachment to a specific incarnation and fear of regenerating.
<ul><li> The Twelfth Doctor acts this way in the aptly-titled "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS35E12HellBent">Hell Bent</a>" (the Series 9 finale) for similar reasons: He has no companion/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralityChain">Morality Chain</a> (because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">she was unjustly executed</span>, which only makes things worse) and just suffered <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColdBloodedTorture">Cold-Blooded Torture</a>, so he's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivenToMadness">Driven to Madness</a>.

In other episodes, especially since the reboot, the Doctor disdains weapons and always attempts to find a peaceful solution first. He is, however, trying to protect <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Vincent van Gogh</span>, who's kind of important to the timeline. This can be excused by him being under the impression that Amy's life was in immediate danger, and the fact that each new incarnation of the character is different from the last, including their tendency to use or avoid martial force.

Apparently the Doctor being a warrior is really out of character, which is justified as the War Doctor was specifically meant as a warrior. In fact the War Doctor rejects the title entirely, which is why he isn't counted in the numbering.

This is the same woman he's spent years encouraging to experience the real world, stand up for women's rights and establish her independence. The writers admitted they filmed a scene when Branson apologized but they ran out of time during the episode.

There's a brief pause while everyone digests this before Father Dougal comments "He's right, Ted", and the previous conversation picks up unchanged.
<ul><li> Played straight in the season 1 finale, "Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest", where Ted and Dougal are unusually callous and cunning (the episode ends with them cheerfully plotting Father Jack's death, with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Dougal</a> actually picking up on the subtleties of the conversation).

It's done so Carly realises that she's back because the webshow exists again, but it's incredibly out of character for Freddie, who would never ever leave Carly sobbing in the hallway crying like that.

<ul><li> In the episode "Be My Friend", when he and Laura find a baby, Mrs. Oleson asks Charles who the baby belongs to. Charles tells her it's Laura's baby rather than saying they found the baby. This is only necessary for the plot so Mrs. Oleson will think Laura is the mother and Willie is the father, which makes no sense anyway because Mrs. Oleson sees Laura just about every day and would have noticed if she was pregnant.
</li><li> In a guest appearance by Todd Bridges, Mrs. Oleson doesn't want a black boy going to school in Walnut Grove. Her excuse is that the school is only for the children of the families that live in Walnut Grove. Charles tells her the boy is his, leading her to believe he has an illegitimate son.

She has no idea why she did it, explaining that it was "like [the money] killed the old Lois and replaced her with a crazy person," and has an ashamed, dismayed and confused demeanor when she tries to explain herself that is never seen from her at <em>any</em> other point in the series.
</li><li> In Charles Winchester's earlier episodes on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>, he screws over Korean peasants by buying scrip at a tenth of its value to exchange for new scrip. This is wildly out of character for someone from New England blue blood old money, especially since he later anonymously donates chocolates to an orphanage on Christmas. The entire episode — doing unscrupulous things to make a quick buck — almost feels like a leftover Frank script with the names changed.

However, the real OOC moment is from Alex, who comments that she wouldn't "get out of bed" for a trophy the size of Mitchell's and later, when the latter explains his case, agrees with him, citing her mom putting lesser works of Haley &amp; Luke's on the wall next to a plaque she won as if they were all equal. Obviously, this is done so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone">Mitchell will realize how petty he's being</a>, and Alex has been shown to be proud of her accomplishments on the show before, but never in such a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass-y</a> manner.
</li><li> Weird example from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RedDwarf">Red Dwarf</a></em>. In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonIIParallelUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonIIParallelUniverse">Parallel Universe</a>" the crew travel to a parallel universe populated by opposite sex versions of themselves. Lister ends up sleeping with his female alternate universe self and when the possibility of him being pregnant is raised — in this universe men are the ones who carry the baby — the female Lister is amazingly callous and indifferent, claiming it was solely his problem and that he should have used protection. Now the episode is very clear that the female counterparts have <em>identical</em> personalities to the regular crew and it is impossible to imagine the regular universe Lister being so insensitive to a woman he might have gotten pregnant.
<ul><li> It's also hard to imagine Rimmer ever behaving the way his female equivalent did. In the rare occasions when he's been seen interacting with women, he's normally either been quite shy or highly respectful to their position as a superior officer (consider "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonIVCamille" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonIVCamille">Camille</a>" and "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVHoloship" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/RedDwarfSeasonVHoloship">Holoship</a>"). As much of a smeg head as he can be, it's extremely difficult to imagine him ever wanting to show a woman some video of two women together to turn them on. It seems evident that the female versions actually had vastly different attitudes to their male equivalents.

Instead of simply clocking the guy or pretending to be an overprotective brother or tavern worker, Allan inexplicably yells: "this isn't part of the plan!"

There is also an earlier episode in which our professional thief acts ridiculously clumsy when breaking into a castle bedroom, presumably so that Tuck, the show's <em>other</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy">Scrappy</a>, can roll his eyes at him.

After spending two seasons as an incredibly careful and discreet spy, not to mention the voice of reason and compassion, Marian suddenly decides to kill the Sheriff of Nottingham. Repeat: she decides to assassinate a man by stabbing him in the back based on a <em>rumour</em> floating around the castle that the Sheriff was going to try and kill King Richard, despite the fact that she knows Prince John has placed a life insurance on the Sheriff's head that stipulates Nottingham will be destroyed if anything happens to him. She sneaks into his room with a sword and is instantly caught in the act of trying to <em>murder him in cold blood</em>.

<ul><li> Downplayed in "Me Wait" song. It was meant to teach patience, or, as it was referred to in the song, "self-control", but the whole premise of the song is that Cookie Monster, despite wanting the cookies, well...waits.

There was a general reaction "ew, guys <em>do</em> that?" from everyone, though sweet, prudish Charlotte was like "What's the big deal?". Then when Miranda asked if that meant she would have to reciprocate, open minded Samantha said something "Oh, I would never do that!" and Charlotte replies casually "Why wouldn't one reciprocate?" Might be a play off the idea that the quietest ones are secretly the most freaky, but it still comes out of nowhere and isn't mentioned again.

She had been in prison for treason and brought on board the Enterprise because she was Bajoran and they needed to deal with Bajoran terrorists. Just mentioning her name in the beginning of the episode caused Picard and Riker to tense up. But the real moment came when Riker met her in the transporter room and chews her out for wearing the traditional Bajoran earring, claiming it violates Starfleet dress code. This is despite the fact that Worf wears his family sash at all times. But it was to emphasize that no one liked her.
<ul><li> Tuvok, does the same thing to a Bajoran-Maquis crewman in an episode of Voyager, almost making this an out of character moment for Starfleet in their uniform policies.
</li><li> This is also the period where Troi never wore her uniform <em>at all</em>. The crew's general trait of ignoring the uniform code whenever they feel like it gets lampshaded when a new captain briefly takes command in the next season and makes them follow it.

It is jarring hearing it from a Starfleet character since we rarely, if ever, see sexism in the fleet.
</li><li> Worf seems to get handed this a lot. In another episode, he complained about the Starfleet dress uniform, stating that it "looks like a dress." Riker immediately slaps him down, saying that the comment is sexist and outdated. This is especially odd since a number of background extras of both sexes wore skirts in the early seasons.

</li><li> Spock has several interesting examples. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E0TheCage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E0TheCage">the original un-aired pilot</a>, he broadly grinned when touching a strange, quivering plant, and in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E1TheManTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS1E1TheManTrap">The Man Trap</a>" he began violently striking a monster-disguised-as-a-woman to prove that she really wasn't McCoy's long-lost love, the "woman" in question showing no ill effects and casually throwing Spock across the room in retaliation. These can be attributed to the fact that it was early in the series and Spock's character — not to mention Vulcan culture in general — hadn't been fully realized. Then in the Season 2 episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E1AmokTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS2E1AmokTime">Amok Time</a>", a visibly distraught Spock thinks he has killed Kirk during a Pon Farr duel in which Spock was basically out of his mind thanks to crazy Vulcan hormones, but when Kirk unexpectedly shows up alive and well, Spock smiles with joy and excitedly rushes towards his friend before quickly regaining control of his emotions and apologizing for his embarrassing outburst. This, of course, was to show the depth of the friendship between he and Kirk.
</li><li> In the episode "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E19RequiemForMethuselah" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekS3E19RequiemForMethuselah">Requiem for Methuselah</a>", Kirk completely ignores the fact that his crew is in danger and keeps hitting on Rayna. Even though Kirk is a well-established horndog, he would never put that above duty to his ship and friends.

First of all, Kirk himself survived a similar massacre and was very angry at the man who did it, and second of all, he doesn't so easily accept no-win scenarios.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThatsSoRaven">That's So Raven</a></em> episode "Juicer Consequences", Raven spends the first half of the episode being uncharacteristically self-absorbed, seemingly just because the storyline required her to be.
</li><li> In the third season finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood">True Blood</a></em>, Sookie, the sweet-natured protagonist, is left alone to guard Russell Edgington, the season's main villain as well as the most powerful vampire ever seen on the show, while he is rendered completely harmless. When she finds out he was clinging on the destroyed remains of his vampire lover, <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCwwC3eaMbY">she decides to taunt him by flushing the remains down the sink and making him listen to it<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. And follows it up with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLaugh">maniacal laugh</a>. Many fans consider this to be the most outright Out of Character moment in the entire show, as well as one of the few times <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaPaquin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnnaPaquin">Anna Paquin</a> was ever truly terrifying. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>, if you consider <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Sookie was a fairy</span>, and then add that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">fairies can be horrifying</span>, as proven by the first episode of season 4.

He then proceeds to amble down the hall humming "Put On a Happy Face" while cheerily greeting other staffers, who stop and stare at him as though he just sprouted antlers.

<ul><li> One famous scene depicts <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Jesus">Jesus</a> finding people treating the Temple like a marketplace. He proceeds to make a whip out of reeds and use it to shoo them out, while also overturning all their tables and generally making a huge mess of things.
</li><li> Normally, Jesus will use his powers only to help people in need. There are however two stories, where he seems to just want to prove that he believes in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatMeasureIsANonHuman">What Measure Is a Non-Human?</a>
<ul><li> One time, Jesus curses a fig tree to wither because it will not bear fruit out of season. It is noted in the text that he was hungry, but he should have known what season it was and not expect the tree to bear fruit at the time. Modern readers will often find this story very jarring.
</li><li> Another time, Jesus moves a group of demons from a possessed man onto a herd of pigs. After that, the pigs run down a hill and drown themselves in a lake. Obviously, the man is meant to be worth more than any number of pigs. But very much like the story with the fig tree, this story will be jarring to many modern readers.
</li></ul></li><li> In several other places Jesus also advises the Apostles to buy swords or threatens people with Hell like a born-and-bred rabid fundie. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext">It Makes Sense in Context</a>, but just as in the cases above, is nothing like the picture of Jesus most people have.

His co-host Jonathan Coachman had a bad habit of ignoring the match in the ring in favor of endlessly shilling the main event and the main event wrestlers. Raven finally interrupted him mid-shill, <em>berated</em> him for being disrespectful for the men in the ring and ordered him to call the match that was actually happening. There's a reason many WWF/WWE fans viewed Raven's commentary run as too good to last.

</li><li> In fact, the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series gets it pretty bad in <em>Smash Bros</em> in general. One of Ike's win quotes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosBrawl">Brawl</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBrosForNintendo3DSAndWiiU">4</a></em> is "You'll get no sympathy from me," which doesn't match up with his character in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemRadiantDawn">Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn</a></em>, where he was generally very sympathetic even to his enemies. Another bad case is Lucina, who in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> is portrayed as seeing Marth and Ike as historical heroes that she greatly looked up to, which is portrayed accurately in her introduction trailer for <em>Smash 4</em>, where she seems amazed to see them in person. However, when she beats them in a match, she's given a unique victory quote where she lays some seriously uncharacteristic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a> on these characters she supposedly looks up to. This is likely a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostInTranslation">Lost in Translation</a>; in the original Japanese, she is in awe of their power; the quotes were translated right, it's just that the tone of her voice was wrong.
</li><li> Likewise, the win quote female Robin has when she defeats Lucina (i.e. "How can you protect Chrom if you can't protect yourself?") is a bit out of place, as in the original game Lucina's abilities are never in question. Roy's quotes meanwhile don't make him that different from how he is in canon, but even then he sounds rather <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hotblooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hotblooded">hotblooded</a> in battle, and some official pictures show him holding a grudge against <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NamesTheSame">Roy Koopa</a>.
</li><li> On that note, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperMarioBros">Mario</a> of all people becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerpetualFrowner">Perpetual Frowner</a> in <em>Brawl</em>.
</li><li> Also in <em>Brawl</em>, Lucas is hit pretty hard with the Flanderization stick. In a game where nearly every character has their end of game personalities and powers (Ness ready to face off against Porky, Samus ready to fight Ridley, and so on) Lucas is the only one who acts below that seeing his final boss equivalent as something terrifying. In itself that's not too bad, but it becomes truly OOC when Ness is hit by the Trophy gun and runs in terror away from Wario, abandoning his new friend who he just fought with to a villain. Even in the prologue chapter of Mother 3 where Lucas is very much known as 'a crybaby' and is 3 years younger than he is in the main game, the moment he realizes his friends were in danger (from <em>tanks</em>, no less), he riled together the creatures of the forest and mounted a rescue attack to save them. It's pretty farfetched to expect the same kid, 3 years later, to abandon another psychic kid to a single human villain just because they have a scary gun and garlic breath.

Yet in the Gunship encounter, they jump at the chance to fight each other. In that same scene, Varian, who usually displays outright hatred and disdain for orcs and the Horde in general (even walking out of a diplomatic meeting to discuss how to deal with Yogg-Saron, a threat to all organic life, rather than work with them), actually steps in to stop Muradin and Saurfang from fighting, telling Muradin to let him pass and collect his son's body. While touching, none of the characters involved seem to be acting much in character in this particular episode.

Due to the huge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleCast">Ensemble Cast</a>, the game assigns a standard, canned dialogue to whomever the player has in the party leader slot, whether it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser">Sabin</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildChild">Gau</a>. One example early in the game makes it possible for Shadow, at that point an assassin/mercenary who can leave the party at any time, rage about inhumane acts. This is especially notable for Umaro, whose only scripted dialogue consists of grunts, but becomes perfectly articulate when given one of the aforementioned character-neutral lines. This also throws up continuity errors when Sabin or Edgar, whose mother died in childbirth, mention (thanks to a potted line shared with several other characters) that their mother told them about Espers.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified">Justified</a>: Cloud is surprisingly upbeat and anxious to get into battles during his Nibelheim flashback; the only time you see him in his more familiar, mellow persona is when he visits his mother. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that this is because outside of that one scene and the brief stop in Tifa's home, what you're seeing is what <em>Zack</em> did in Nibelheim, but Cloud is narrating the events as if he, himself, did them.</span>
</li><li> After being ambushed en route, the party members will speculate about one of the members being a spy, and the normally detached and insightful Cloud inexplicably announces that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero">trusts everyone here</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroBall">insists they drop the subject</a>.

A usually dignified and erudite villain, he instead lobs a Materia at Cloud, before doing a hilarious front flip and zooming off towards the camera with his mouth open.
</li><li> Vincent's icy, melodramatic vibe will disappear in some of his party dialogue, where he's cheerfully introducing himself to randoms and showing a slight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HotBlooded">Hot-Blooded</a> side. These are probably left over from an earlier draft of the script where Vincent was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlikelyHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnlikelyHero">Unlikely Hero</a> private detective.
</li><li> While optional sidequest party leader dialogue is fully rewritten for Tifa and Cid's stints as leader, averting the worst of this, the inability to change blocking and the overall flow of scenes makes it obvious in some cases that the scenes were written for Cloud. This is particularly obvious with Tifa, usually a passionate and caring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom">Team Mom</a>, who will suddenly act aloof about whether to save a helpless baby bird from an army of mercenaries from a company she hates more than anything in the world, or repeatedly neg Yuffie before marching off without asking for her name.

</li><li> Dialogue in the more obscure, less playtested scenes tends to be a bit 'off' due to using slightly older versions of the characters' speech patterns.

This is a political opinion that wouldn't make sense for him to have (as the Prince of Lucis, whose subjects and own father were murdered by Niflheim forces at the start of the game), and would be a gobsmackingly terrible idea in the context of his Kingdom being the only government in Eos that does not entirely consist of <em>literal demons</em> by that point.

<ul><li> In the unreleased <em>The Legend of Mata Nui</em> game, both Pohatu and Gali act unusually hostile in the former's introduction. Rather than exploring his surroundings with his usual gleeful, sociable attitude, Pohatu is first seen standing in place irritably kicking boulders around and he even threatens his "sister" with violence. Gali isn't exactly herself either as she further angers and smack-talks Pohatu, instead of acting as the kind and passionate voice of reason.

Amusingly, this applies to Grif himself when he gets possessed by the rogue AI. However, instead of becoming a petty tyrant like the other Reds, Grif just notes that he briefly feels the impulse to conquer the universe, and quickly recognizes that this out of character for him because that would take <em>work</em>. Instead of fighting it, he reverts to his natural instincts and falls asleep standing up, causing the Omega AI to eject itself from his body (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatTheCurseOutOfHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatTheCurseOutOfHim">without getting punched in the face by Tex to accomplish the same thing</a>).

The creators even acknowledge they had to ignore that so they could give more attention to Katara's feelings of betrayal.

</li><li> In "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E4Rosebud" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS5E4Rosebud">Rosebud</a>", Homer and Bart are gloating that they can demand any price for returning Bobo to Mr Burns, and Marge replies "Now I'm sure he'll offer a fair reward ...

This is probably the nicest Burns has ever been.

Curiously, later when the Springfield kids are stranded on an island, Sherri blames Lisa for the crash, but Nelson blames Milhouse, who rolled a grapefruit on the bus floor, which accidentally jammed the brake pedal, causing the bus to crash.

Ned himself recognizes the severity of the outburst, and immediately drives himself to a mental institution. However, this was explained as the result of Ned repressing his rage and hatred of his parents for literally <em>decades</em>. The piss-poor job the citizens did rebuilding his house was just the last straw.

Since the test is thrown out anyway at the end, there's no real telling if the problem was with Lisa or the test itself with Lisa being the only one visibly distraught.

Stewie complains to Brian about the horrible conditions the preschool is in and how the teacher lets the kids do whatever they want. Brian goes to have a talk with the teacher until he sees how hot she looks. Brian then decides to <em>defend the teacher</em> and being the horn dog that he is, tries to date her. Stewie suffers more under the horrible conditions and tries to tell Lois, only for Brian to shut him up. Brian then sees the teacher has a boyfriend already so Brian decides to call the cops on her for how she ran the school just because of that.

</li><li> Chris is usually portrayed as a dimwitted boy who can also be sweet and caring to girls that he likes. This is turned on its head in one episode where Chris dates <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Connie</a> and she actually cares for him until she discovers that Chris dumped her to be with two other girls. This is due to Connie overinflating Chris' ego but it still looks very out of place for Chris' character before and after this episode.
</li><li> Meg in "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS11E13ChrisCross" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FamilyGuyS11E13ChrisCross">Chris Cross</a>," when she blackmails Chris and takes it too far to the point when Chris runs away from home.

</li><li> In the episode "Pop Goes The Ed" Double D foolishly attacks a beehive with a baseball bat and encourages Ed to do it thinking it would be a good idea, normally Double D is cautious and paranoid about things like that.
</li><li> Also, in "Nagged To Ed", Double D, the same guy who is adamant about good manners, is eating his sandwich (made for him and the other two Eds by the Kankers) like a pig.
</li><li> In the episode "Home-Cooked Eds", the Eds repeatedly do things that they repeatedly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">lampshade</a> they'd expect another Ed to have done instead. For example, Eddy acting like Ed and Edd, and Edd acting like Ed.

To his surprise, though, Vicky's upset that she is alone on Thanksgiving because her parents and Tootie went out to get cranberry sauce and their car broke down. That's right, in this book, Timmy's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> babysitter worries about her family, whom she treats no differently than him on the show.

</li><li> In at least two episodes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/KingOfTheHill">King of the Hill</a></em> Hank acts very out of character.
<ul><li> In "Strangeness on a Train", upon seeing that Peggy's birthday party isn't going well, he takes her into the bathroom and they have sex. Now Hank is pretty uptight and embarrassed about that sort of thing, and certainly would've never done that in a public place in earlier seasons.
</li><li> In "Master of Puppets" Hank gives into Bobby's demands, buys him gifts, and coddles him after accidentally forgetting to pick him up one night. Now Hank would never give into Bobby's demands unless he was doing something he felt was honest or worthwhile like a job or a sport but Bobby was being selfish and bratty; the Hank of the earlier seasons would've probably give him advice on how life isn't always fair and tell him to get over it.
</li><li> In "Texas City Twister", Hank is portrayed as more of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, as he desperately wants to get Luanne out of the house and back into her old trailer park and doesn't even have the decency to say goodbye.

In one episode he was recruited as a substitute for the main characters roller hockey team while everyone else but Sam is sick. When they managed to win a key game Eddie pulled his mask up in celebration. When he realized what he did, he put his mask back on and skulked away back into the shadows, murmuring with embarrassment "I succumbed." Although after that episode, he takes off his mask occasionally, usually as the punchline of a scene.
</li><li> Otto plays this straight in one episode when Lars challenges him to a mountain board race down a course that nobody has ever completed. Otto, who normally has a "never give up" attitude, begins to suffer a self-defeating panic attack after all of his wipeouts in training. His sister Reggie couldn't believe her ears when Otto said he couldn't do it.

<ul><li> In the episode "Soccer Boy", TJ acts very out of character. Mikey (one of his best friends) is excluded from their football team because he isn't good at sports. TJ not only <em>allows</em> this to happen but supports the decision as well. This is the same boy who has shown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty">Undying Loyalty</a> towards his friends in the face of expulsion, public humiliation and social rejection. A lot of fans were scratching their heads at that one.
</li><li> There's another one in "The Lost Ball", when Gus accidentally kicks the new ball the kids found over the fence where a (supposedly) scary old lady lives. His classmates spend the rest of the episode taunting him for being a "ball loser" — including <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeart">Mikey</a></em>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GentleGiant">Gentle Giant</a>, emotional core of the group and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeterosexualLifePartners">the closest one to Gus</a>, to boot!

You wouldn't guess that if you knew him only from "Fort Tender," wherein he absolutely (and frustratingly) refuses to help TJ and his friends reclaim their fort from Lawson and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GangOfBullies">Gang of Bullies</a> on the grounds of the (admittedly unfair) "Finders Keepers" rule, which, by the way, he <em>refuses to repeal</em>!

Due to a lot of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter">Depending on the Writer</a> circumstances, you get a lot of moments where the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy">Nice Guys</a>/Girls suddenly belt out mean comments or act like assholes to others, the complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkasses</a> suddenly say something polite or do something out of genuine sympathy for someone they normally don't care for, or the smart, sensible, and sane characters lose their common sense or do something incredibly idiotic (among other kinds of OOC behaviour). It gets even worse when it comes to friendships, where two contestants will be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodWhiplash">laughing and hugging one day, and trying to slit each other's throats the next</a>. Relationships likewise; due to the writers' love for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoyoPlotPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoyoPlotPoint">Yo-Yo Plot Point</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLoveIsBoring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueLoveIsBoring">True Love Is Boring</a> tropes, it's pretty common for the status of a couple's relationship to fluctuate between utterly devoted to each other and constantly on the verge of breaking up.

</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria">Daria</a></em>, Sandi is shown to be a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> who exploits the fashion club's emotional weaknesses and attempts to find Quinn's throughout the entire series. However, in "Fire!", when Quinn is receiving a lot of gifts from a friendly bellboy, Sandi points out that he's acting quite suspicious and thinks he might be a stalker — like she's showing genuine concern for Quinn being safe. Might be a case where stalking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvenEvilHasStandards">is too much even for Sandi</a>. "Fat Like Me" also features one, but that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenPrincess">pretty much the entire point of the episode</a>.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JimmyTwoShoes">Jimmy Two-Shoes</a></em> episode "Heloise, Schmeloise" had a major one for Jimmy.

That said, some would also argue Jimmy being even in love with <em>anyone</em> is OOC when he's usually totally uninterested in dating and only sees girls as friends.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Wakfu">Wakfu</a></em> season 2 Rubilax, who can never resist an opportunity to taunt or insult Sadlygrove, doesn't talk for three straight episodes after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">betraying the demon king Rushu</span>.

When Cap asks the other Avengers if they would like to help, Hulk's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VitriolicBestBuds">Vitriolic Best Bud</a> Hawkeye doesn't raise his hand.
</li><li> The last 10-minute episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy</a></em>, "Heartburn" has Mandy—usually stoic and cross—actually crying when she fears that Irwin may be her true love. This may be a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OOCIsSeriousBusiness">OOC Is Serious Business</a> (Irwin as her true love is <em>that</em> bad in her opinion).
<ul><li> Not so strange if you saw the special episode where the boogeyman showed everyone's darkest fears. Mandy ends up in a house with a grown-up, personality changed version of herself who acts like a stereotypical loving mother. However that's not what causes Mandy to scream at the top of her lungs and run out of the house. What does? Seeing said adult is married to <em>Irwin</em> who talks like a 80's black live action tv star complete with saxophone music punctuating his appearance.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold">Hey Arnold!</a></em>:
<ul><li> In the episode "New Teacher" not only does Arnold stand by when the other kids are tormenting Mr Simmons, he can be seen joining in on the tormenting.
</li><li> In "Stinky's Pumpkin", when Mr. Simmons asks his class what the beginning of spring means, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBully">Harold</a> of all people affectionately guesses "Love is in the air?" Though that may have been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">sarcasm</a>.
</li><li> Arnold has another one in "Egg Story" when he and Helga are partnered together to care for an egg as an exercise in parenting. Helga decides to try and be nice to Arnold for once, but before she can, Arnold rips her a new asshole, telling Helga that he is done tolerating her abuse (understandable, but Helga hasn't done anything bad to him up to this point) that he doesn't like her (obviously untrue, since Arnold has admitted to liking Helga in the past and knows that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold">she's not a bad person deep down</a>) and would rather work with anyone else but her (they've successfully worked together several times before this episode, aside from the aforementioned "Biosquare" project). Helga gets furious and rightfully calls Arnold a "big, dumb jerk." The two spend the rest of the episode arguing as a result.
</li><li> Phoebe has one in "The Nanny" when an annoying, meddlesome nanny is hired by Big Bob and moves into Helga's house and starts butting into Helga's routine. Helga gets fed up with this and frames the nanny for stealing so she gets fired. When the other kids hear of this, they all leave Helga alone, including her best friend, who is usually very supportive and understanding of Helga.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FostersHomeForImaginaryFriends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a></em>: Mrs. Foster is the kindly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolOldLady">Cool Old Lady</a> who founded the eponymous location. She loves everybody, including Mac, so why she decided to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> steal all the airline tickets that was going to take many of the main characters to Europe and use them for herself and her friends for no apparent reason, leaving Mac to take the heat for the tickets' disappearance</span> in "Foster's Goes To Europe" is anyone's guess.
</li><li> In one episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenageMutantNinjaTurtles2003">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003)</a></em>, during a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrossOver">Crossover</a> with <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/UsagiYojimbo">Usagi Yojimbo</a></em>, we're immediately introduced to samurai Tomoe Ame, who decides at once to flee from the numerically superior foes she's facing. Tomoe in the source material is not only especially "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>" bloodthirsty, she's known to completely disregard her own safety if she thinks she can take her foes out with her, as <em>bushido</em> demands. In fact, she's repeatedly refused to back down even when it was much smarter. While there was an explanation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist">out of universe</a> (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians">Moral Guardians</a> meant that <em>she wasn't allowed to use the sword she had with her</em>), this is downright bizarre to anyone who's familiar with the character.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur">Arthur</a></em>: Arthur's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassBall">behavior</a> in "So Funny I Forgot To Laugh" went beyond just being a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompressedVice">Compressed Vice</a> and became case of this, as Arthur, one of animation's biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEveryMan">Everymen</a>, began continuously harassing his classmate Sue Ellen over a sweater she was wearing.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo">Kaeloo</a></em>:
<ul><li> The episode "Let's Play Golf" had everyone be out of character. Kaeloo cheats at a game of golf, while usually disapproving of cheating and dishonesty, and at the beginning of the episode she actually calls Stumpy "stupid" to his face. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmartGuy">Mr. Cat</a> says he doesn't believe that the planet is round, and believes Kaeloo's lie about a flying rhinoceros. Quack Quack calls Mr. Cat out on his bullying rather than keeping quiet about it like he usually does. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">Stumpy</a> doesn't believe Kaeloo's lie about the flying rhinoceros, and is the one to denounce her as a cheater</span>.
</li><li> Pretty, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> of the cast, is unusually nice in Episode 57. She behaves as though Kaeloo is her best friend, and actually treats Stumpy like a person.
</li><li> In Episode 91, Stumpy and Quack Quack make fun of Mr. Cat, whereas in most episodes they respect him, especially Stumpy. Kaeloo also doesn't mind joining in, and she takes it to the point of actual bullying.
</li><li> In Episode 133, <em>almost everyone</em> is out of character. Stumpy and Quack Quack, who normally like hanging out with Kaeloo, are determined to keep her away from a party, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Alpha Bitch</a> Pretty, the hostess of said party, apologizes to Kaeloo for not inviting her, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">jerkass</a> Mr. Cat is nicer to Kaeloo than usual, and also nice to Pretty, who he normally hates to the point of wishing her dead.
</li><li> Kaeloo normally tries to portray herself as pure and innocent, but in Episode 141, while on a parody of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheVoice">The Voice</a></em>, she ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GettingCrapPastTheRadar">wearing a revealing outfit and performing a sexually suggestive dance</a> because she thinks it'll help her win.
</li><li> In Episode 105, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Eugly</a>, who is normally one of the nicest characters in the show, is seen laughing at Kaeloo when she gets insulted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">Olaf</a>.
</li><li> In Episode 144, both Kaeloo and Mr. Cat are out of character. Quack Quack gets possessed by a demon, with visible effects; he now has horns, demon wings and tattoos. Mr. Cat is completely oblivious to the fact that something is wrong, and Kaeloo starts to realize that something is different, when normally it would be the other way around. Other strange things include Kaeloo yelling "YOU LOST!" at Stumpy and laughing when she beats him, while normally she would console him about it, and Mr. Cat is nice to everyone and keeps yelling about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakesSenseInContext">how delicious sausages are</a>.
</li><li> In Episode 147, Kaeloo and Mr. Cat are nice to each other and to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChewToy">Stumpy</a>, when usually they would spend the episode fighting each other and bullying Stumpy.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse">The Loud House</a></em>: Lincoln's normally street-wise demeanor when it comes to living with his ten sisters is suddenly ignored in the episode "Brawl in the Family" when he has no idea of the so-called "sister fight protocol" that occurs whenever two or more of his sisters fight. It's possible that this was just the one thing he didn't know, but given how easy it was for him to deal with living with his sisters in the episodes beforehand, it's a bit hard to swallow here.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DanVs">Dan Vs.</a></em>: Ordinarily, Chris plays <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentScully">Agent Scully</a> to Dan's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgentMulder">Agent Mulder</a> whenever bizarre or supernatural forces cause Dan's latest misfortune. Not so in "The Magician", where Chris insists that the titular entity has real magic powers, while Dan spends the episode trying to expose his tricks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LesSisters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LesSisters">Les Sisters</a></em>: While Wendy is usually a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolBigSis">Cool Big Sis</a> and Marie is an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnnoyingYoungerSibling">Annoying Younger Sibling</a>, in the fourth episode Marie does nothing wrong while Wendy acts like a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigSisterBully">Big Sister Bully</a>, ruins Marie's sleepover and tells her to "go play in traffic".
