<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyrieDriveMermaid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ValkyrieDriveMermaid">Valkyrie Drive: Mermaid</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Charlotte</a> is second in authority only to Akira, and is this trope to a ridiculous degree.

</li><li> Miwa Sakimori from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daimos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daimos">Daimos</a></em> is this, and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a>. He mostly hides behind his soldiers or Daimos itself from danger. And when opportunity presents itself, he'll show his extreme racist tendencies by shooting actually harmless Brahmins. And all that's in his mind is... well, you guessed it, promotions.
</li><li> Brigadier General Fessler from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> might have set a record in shortest time between showing up and being offed by his own troops: a few pages, or a few minutes in-story time. In his few pages of life, his only plan of attack in a guerrilla war is to charge, he only thinks of glory for himself, and when the enemy attempts to surrender he refuses, at which point <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">a very different commander archetype</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReasonableAuthorityFigure">Basque Grand</a> has had enough and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">shoots him at point-blank range</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KlingonPromotion">so that he can take command</a>.

<ul><li> Archer in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist">the 2003 anime version</a> fits the trope pretty well too. Incidentally, the anime version of Grand <em>isn't</em> exactly the most lovable commander himself.
</li></ul></li><li> Isen Ryer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamThe08thMSTeam">Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team</a></em> is one of these - he spends his entire time suspecting Shiro Amada of betraying the Federation and sends a GM Sniper on him when he finally deserts; has a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a> mentality towards his troops, going so far as use his own men to detonate their own Mobile Suits to destroy a Zeon base and thinks nothing but the idea of being promoted.
</li><li> Ax Hand Morgan from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em> gives Luffy an extra reason to kick some ass. You even find out later the only reason he was promoted to a position of authority was because of Kuro's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit">Batman Gambit</a> which involved <em>hypnotizing Morgan and everyone else into thinking he captured the notorious Captain Kuro</em>. Also, Spandam can be considered one.
</li><li> General Colbert from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TekkamanBlade">Tekkaman Blade</a></em> is also a real piece of work. Much like Miwa, he too is a racist (so much so he works with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamSEED">Murata Azrael</a> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperRobotWarsJudgment">Super Robot Wars Judgment</a></em>), treats <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">The Hero</a> like a traitorous piece of filth even though he's the most effective means of defeating the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BugWar">Radam</a>. Add in the fact he's also a pretty shameless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> as well, and you've got a total asshole of a Neidermeyer as a result.

For the rest of the operation, he proves to be a skilled commander concerned about the well-being of his men. He's still an over-bearing, self-important asshole, though.

Neidermeyer from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AnimalHouse">Animal House</a></em>. It's doubly ironic because being in the ROTC doesn't make you part of any military branch, meaning Neidermeyer is just a civilian playing pretend. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhereAreTheyNowEpilogue">"Where Are They Now?"

In the John Landis-directed segment of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwilightZoneTheMovie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></em>, we even meet the soldiers who shot him.
</li><li> Lt. Gorman in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Aliens">Aliens</a></em> certainly qualifies for this, due to his relative inexperience, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a> at managing the alien attack, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmchairMilitary">rear-echelon tactics</a> and the resulting lack of respect from his troops. However, this is subverted later in the story in that he tries to apologise for being a bad officer, has no trouble submitting command to a more experienced and competent subordinate and shows great personal bravery, even attempting to save the marine who despised him the most.
</li><li> Corporal Himmelstoss from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllQuietOnTheWesternFront" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AllQuietOnTheWesternFront">All Quiet on the Western Front</a></em>. He bullies Paul Baümer's squad during basic training; in retaliation, they ambush him, put a sack over his head, and beat him bloody. Himmelstoss later is transferred to the front himself, after, depending on the adaptation, "nearly killing a squad of rookies on the muddy field" or maltreating a recruit whose father turned out to have too much influence. He at first performs badly and chickens out of a charge, much to Paul Bäumer's disgust, but when an <em>officer</em> orders him to advance, Himmelstoss charges wildly. His eventual fate varies by adaptation. In the novel, he makes up with his former victims and while acting as substitute company cook sees to it they get good food. In the 1930 film, he is killed when following orders to advance. In the 1979 TV film, he receives an Iron Cross from Kaiser Wilhelm II for his perceived heroics on the battlefield.

When informed by his XO, Lt. Commander Hunter that crew morale is low and that they might need some words of encouragement from their beloved captain, Ramsey takes the opportunity to chew them all out over the intercom for being lazy and feckless. Later, Ramsey goes into full-blown <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">General Ripper</a> mode when he is convinced that his orders to fire the missiles has not been countermanded, despite a cutoff in communications right when the counter-order is sent.

He <em>thought</em> they were actually going to kill him, though.
</li><li> Rear Admiral Graham counts too. He is only concerned with his career and his idea for what the US Navy should be like.

He pulls rank on the commander of the <em>Orlando</em> and then orders Knox's men around like a bunch of recruits, smugly claiming that "the Admiral has the con". He's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawHypocrite">Straw Hypocrite</a>, as he himself cheats his way through war games in order to improve his standing but feels completely justified in that (even though the whole point of this particular exercise is to explore the potential vulnerability of the Navy to an unorthodox terrorist with an old diesel sub).

For all of that, Yorke credits him with improving the quality of the regiment through his strict discipline.

</li><li> Lieutenant Wolfe in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Platoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Platoon">Platoon</a></em>, the leader of the titular platoon. An incompetent coward who is unable to control his own soldiers, he lets Elias and Barnes do as they like (and the only order he gives is to burn down the village).

Piqued at being ordered back to the US (he is considered too inexperienced to participate in D-Day) he launches an attack on the church where the German Fallschirmjager (paratroops) are holed up without doing a proper recon, completely missing the germans hidden at various points in the village and wiping out his entire platoon; to top it all he gets killed by Joanna Grey while trying to kill her with a grenade; since they were played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LarryHagman">Larry Hagman</a> and Jean Marsh respectively this spawned a thousand t-shirts saying "Rose (from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UpstairsDownstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UpstairsDownstairs">Upstairs Downstairs</a></em>) Shot J.R!

He doesn't fare better than the officer he replaced by not listening to valuable advice of the more experienced non-coms, threatening subordinates at gunpoint for not listening to orders and making terrible tactical decisions as a result. He finally crosses the line when he chooses to hold the line as ordered to by the higher-ups, essentially ordering his men to their deaths. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It's no wonder he ends up with the exact same <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">fate</a> as the previous captain</span>.
</li><li> Major Erich Kaempffer in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKeep" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheKeep">The Keep</a></em>. He's a ruthless, narrow-minded bully, even by the standards of the insanely brutal SS Einsatzkommando.

His first act on arriving is to have three people shot for unclear reasons, take over from the more experienced Captain Woermann and generally ignore everything he says. Bizarrely, after being led to believe Glaeken can be useful to him in discovering the identity of the keep's owner(s), when Glaeken resists arrest, kills an SS soldier and is then shot and seemingly killed himself, Kaempffer not only doesn't care about his dead man but also doesn't seem to realize that the <em>one</em> (as far as he knew) probable link to finding out what he so desperately wanted to know just got shot off of a cliff.

<ul><li> Colonel Jannings, who smugly says that the Della Norte Dam that the Americans want to destroy is impregnable, over the objections of Wehrmacht officer Captain von Hecht. He insists further their "obvious" target is the Grimaldi Tunnel. Surprise, surprise, the dam is in von Hecht's district, while the tunnel is in Jannings'. Although never said outright, Jannings appears to be attempting to discredit the outspoken, anti-Nazi (or at least anti-SS) von Hecht and wrest control from a defanged Wehrmacht by insisting resources and men be sent to <em>him</em>, not von Hecht. We never do get to see what his reaction is when he's told the dam got blown up, sadly.
</li><li> Major Taussig, one of Jannings' subordinates. Like his superior, practically everything goes in one ear and out the other, and even when actual evidence comes up, he ignores it if clashes with what he previously believed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Von Hecht ends up growing tired of his stubbornness and lack of foresight, and just plain frags him, 'Nam style.</span>

All he has to do is transport the Bastards to a prison, but he has to be an arrogant and abusive jerk about it. When some of the prisoners attempt to escape during a German air raid, the sergeant shoots them in the back. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Tellingly, when the prisoners turn the tables on their captors, the sergeant is one of the only ones they kill</span>.

</li><li> At D-Day, a German officer locks Jun-Shik and Tatsuo in a room with two machine guns, forcing them to fight off the American landing.

</li><li> Played with in <em>What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?</em> Captain Lionel Cash has a stick up his butt from the moment he appears onscreen, demanding instant respect and threatening subordinates with demotion at the drop of a hat. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">He eventually gets better after learning how to unwind, but overnight things pretty much devolve into anarchy without him enforcing the rules, creating huge problems involving an arriving American intelligence officer, so sometimes it seems The Neidermeyer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">has a point</a>.</span>

He freely allows the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LizardFolk">Grik</a> to kill and eat a percentage of his crew to placate them and has no problems sending pilots on suicide missions (even telling them not bothering coming back if they fail).
</li><li> General Lord Ronald Rust from the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld">Discworld</a></em> novels doesn't actually get shot by his own men in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jingo">Jingo</a></em>, but his overbearing superiority and tactical incompetence make it very tempting. As a captain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NightWatchDiscworld">Night Watch</a></em>, he is knocked unconscious by his own men when he orders them to fire on civilians.
<ul><li> Corporal Strappi from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MonstrousRegiment">Monstrous Regiment</a></em>.
</li><li> While not in a military organization, Sergeant Fred Colon quickly becomes this after being promoted to Acting Captain in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFifthElephant">The Fifth Elephant</a></em>. By the time Carrot returns to resume authority, Colon has fired or driven off all members of the Watch, with only a handful hanging around informally enforcing the law.
<ul><li> Fred differs from most Neidermeyers in that he is not a bad man, merely a <em>very</em> bad officer. He didn't want the promotion, and the stress drove him completely bonkers, convinced that if he can find out who is stealing sugar cubes (he's doing it subconsciously, and he's really bad at counting) all the other problems will go away. He's incredibly relieved when Captain Carrot returns and he can be a sergeant again.
</li><li> Vimes hasn't promoted Fred from Sergeant (or Nobby from Corporal) because despite the fact they're senior to almost <em>everybody</em> in the Watch (Colon even has seniority on His Grace himself), they're perfectly happy in the ranks they hold and <strong>really</strong> aren't suited for anything higher anyway.
</li></ul></li><li> Actually, nearly every general in the armies of the Sto Plains (the area in which Ankh-Morpork lies) counts as this, since their general battle strategy is to hurl their men at the enemy and receive "glorious casualties", since apparently the number of fallen men equals how great the battle was for them. If they actually win anything, that's a nice albeit unimportant bonus. They see the famous general Tacticus as a dishonorable military leader because he had the distinct tendency to win battles and wars and bring most of his soldiers back alive. The official metric goes something like this: First, both sides throw their men at each other. Then, you subtract <em>your</em> casualties from <em>their</em> casualties, and "if the answer is a positive sum, it was a glorious victory".
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Doom">Doom</a></em>:
<ul><li> Lieutenant Weems from <em>Knee-Deep in the Dead</em>. He was so incompetent and cowardly that he ordered his men to fire on a bunch of harmless monks protesting their war efforts, mistaking them for suicide bombers even after one of his scout Arlene told him they were harmless. Fly decked him for that, and that's why he is stuck on suspension in the cafeteria on Phobos when everything goes to Hell. Throughout the novel Fly has unflattering thoughts about Weems, believing that he's the kind of guy who would side with the alien invaders if it meant saving his own skin. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Fly finds the bodies of Weems and another soldier who had entered a suicide pact after the aliens trapped them in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FateWorseThanDeath">Fate Worse than Death</a> by <em>fusing their heads together</em>, after that he feels too much pity to hate the man anymore</span>.
</li><li> Hidalgo in <em>Infernal Sky</em> invokes this.

Hidalgo introduces himself by stating he's not going to fraternize with them, demands proper uniform maintenance, and tells Fly that almost saving the world nearly makes up for punching his last CO. Fly's natural dislike of officers, their experience with Lt. Weems, and the high stakes of the mission lead Arlene to suggest killing Hidalgo if he's a liability. In time the whole squad warms to each other, only to suddenly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedABridgeOnHim">Drop a Bridge on Him</a> when a teleporter malfunction causes Fly to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleFrag">Tele-Frag</a> Hidalgo.

We don't see very much of him in the movie, but the characterization is plausible from what we do see.
<ul><li> Given the rate of promotion in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a> universe, could this be Lieutenant Styles from the Original Series episode "Balance of Terror"?

Caxton's allies Clara Hsu and Officer Glauer acknowledge that Fetlock's adherence to the rules isn't a bad thing in itself, and respect that he would have accepted his own sentence if he was ever brought up on the charges that led to Caxton being arrested, but his adherence to the law prevents him from recognising that his strategies won't work when dealing with vampires; his determination to keep his troops alive just means that the vampires are killing innocent civilians instead, his refusal to believe Caxton when she claims the main vampire isn't dead gave her foe two years to make a new plan, and when he finally tries to go after the vampires he gets his entire team killed because he relied on a show of force rather than ask Caxton to help out.

Although he lacks the "You're all worthless and weak!!" part, he is still more than willing to send the unfortunate men under his command into needlessly costly and bloody offensives that end up gaining little. He constantly tries to seek glory wherever he can and also is more than willing to hog it all and push all the blame on others when something fails. However, by the end of the trilogy, he later proves to be a competent officer when he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">disobeys the US general Staff's orders on not using tanks in a concentrated formation. This leads to the US occupying Kentucky and later forces the Confederate States to surrender once other officers begin copying it.</span>
<ul><li> That wasn't being a competent officer. That was being the same idiot he'd always been and happening to get lucky this time. As his aide-de-camp later (frequently) reminisces.
</li><li> Boris Lavochkin is the "psychotic hard-ass" version during the Second Great War - a brutal and vindictive officer who didn't have any qualms about massacring civilians or treating his own men with thinly-disguised contempt. He vociferously protested being ordered not to invade Charleston, South Carolina <em>even after the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city</em> because he wanted the glory of capturing the city that sparked the Confederacy.

First, she takes him down a peg by showing McCarthy that the Chtorran he 'killed' is still very much alive. Then she points out that everyone wants to look up to their superiors, so an officer's job is to <em>inspire</em> people, not boss them about. She finishes by congratulating McCarthy on his shooting and asks him to bring flowers next time. McCarthy is highly embarrassed, but learns from the experience. In "A Season for Slaughter" however, when pushed too far by incompetent Major Bellus, McCarthy doesn't educate this Neidermeyer, he demolishes him. On worldwide live television.

Near the end, with his ship damaged and obviously beyond hope of winning the battle, he refuses an offer for surrender and orders the engines to full power, with the intention of ramming the planet and dying with his ship and crew in a blaze of glory. He is promptly shot by a subordinate, who then acts as captain and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm">accepts the offer to surrender</a>.

His inexperience and incapacity for the rank (bestowed after the more able Sergeant Telfer is demobilised) cause problems.

Colonel Vaganov is an especially dangerous example because he's very smart and good at playing the career game. He quickly singles Mazer out as a competent marine and does what he can to use Mazer for his own advancement. When Mazer disobeys his self-serving order for the good of humanity, Vaganov has him arrested and treated inhumanely, thinking that Mazer is playing his own career game and is trying to undermine Vaganov, before sending him to be court-martialed by an admiral, who's a good friend of his. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the authors had to add this element to he prequels in order to stay true to the one-off line about Mazer from the original novel involving him being court-martialed twice and being largely unknown. The only way for someone like him to be court-martialed would be for the IF to be full of corrupt careerists, who resent competent officers and sabotage them. The <em>Mazer in Prison</em> comic (taking place between the prequels and the original novel) has Mazer holding himself hostage in order to force the IF to replace the careerists with competent officers. It works.
<ul><li> Notably, there are times when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassHasAPoint">Vaganov isn't entirely wrong</a>, such as when he sends Mazer and Bingwen into a dangerous situation rather than take the safer option in order to obtain more intel on the Formics. The revised mission ends up discovering that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the Hive Queen is breeding daughters in asteroids in order to serve as local commanders, allowing her to focus on better controlling a smaller number of soldiers. Bingwen manages to kill one of the daughters with a crossbow bolt through the eye and then igniting the hydrogen in the asteroid. This leaves an intact Formic warship with no crew to study</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame">Ender's Game</a></em>, Bonzo Madrid, as commander of Salamander Army, proudly overdisciplines his boys (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSmurfettePrinciple">Petra</a>) with a sharp tongue and a quick backhand. He is particularly resentful of Ender being assigned to his command as underage and untested <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat">New Meat</a>, and so puts him under strict orders to hang back and do absolutely nothing in battles, with the goal of gaming Ender's efficiency rating (no points will be deducted for missed shots if he never draws his gun) so he will be easier to trade to another army. When Ender sees Salamander losing one battle to Leopard Army—due to poor morale, no less—he springs into action at the last minute and inflicts just enough casualties to prevent Leopard from claiming victory. Bonzo rewards Ender for having turned a loss into a draw by beating him up because "no good soldier ever disobeys."

In fact, three guards that had previously deserted returned to volunteer as well. Notably, Klink gets this from <em>all</em> directions: not only do his men (and the Allied prisoners) detest him for his incompetence, cowardice, and ego, but everyone above him in the German chain of command knows that he's massively incompetent. The only reason he hasn't been sent off to the Russian Front is that Stalag 13 hasn't had a single successful escape (thanks to the Heroes working behind the scenes) since he took command.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LastOfTheSummerWine">Last of the Summer Wine</a></em>:
<ul><li> Had Foggy Dewhurst, a former corporal in the Army. Subverted in that he's now a civilian now, and even when he was in the Army, he was only a sign writer, and thus probably never saw any action. This doesn't stop him from constantly finding reasons to boss Compo and Clegg around, often pretending he's genuinely interested in helping other people. He's so determined to inflict his will on them that on one occasion, he started strangling Compo, completely unprovoked because he simply <em>thought</em> he was going to embarrass him. Too bad the vicar's wife saw him...
</li><li> Subverted with his predecessor, Cyril Blamire, who was also a corporal in the Army and similar to Foggy - right down to the mustache - but unlike him, Blamire was content with his retirement and, despite bickering constantly, was good friends with Compo and Clegg.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MASH">M*A*S*H</a></em>:
<ul><li> Major Frank Burns is probably the most visible example. An incompetent doctor, a stickler for draconian discipline, loud, obnoxious, entitled, bullying, and often blaming everyone but himself for his own idiocy, Burns is disliked by every single person in the 4077th MASH unit, except for his lover Margaret Houlihan, who's also one of these (as elaborated on below). This is especially notable because he's an officer and not enlisted.
</li><li> <em>M*A*S*H</em> also had several Foe of the Week commanders who either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTrickster">learned a lesson or were otherwise removed from command</a> by the doctors.
</li><li> When Major Burns left the series (due to having a psychological breakdown caused by the marriage of Major Houlihan - which led to him causing havoc in Tokyo while on RnR), the Army, in its infinite wisdom, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel and gave him a cushy job in a stateside Veteran's Hospital</a>... which is extra disconcerting given that Major Burns was always made out to be an incompetent doctor, has no friends in high places, and the Army historically had a medieval attitude towards officers who go wacko.
</li><li> Margaret Houlihan is this herself in the beginning. Insecure in herself because her father is a career officer who really wanted a son to follow in his footsteps, and aware that opportunities for a female officer are limited, she is harsh on her nurses and feels alienated and alone. After the departure of Burns, she mellows out and passes on from her own Neidermeyer stage, becoming a competent and compassionate officer, learning from Potter, Hawkeye, and BJ.
</li><li> Hawkeye and Winchester both had their opportunity to be Neidermeyers when given the chance to command. Anyone other than Blake or Potter in charge of the 4077th ends up as this trope. The difference between them and Burns is that these episodes set up an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop">An Aesop</a> about the difficulty of true leadership when the rest of the main cast calls them out on it, and they see the error of their ways.
</li><li> Not so much in the earlier seasons. In the Season 3 episode "Officer of the Day", Hawkeye's command of the 4077th was treated as little more than a day at the office; he essentially spent the whole period doing what he always did, albeit while having to deal with a visit from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Colonel Flagg</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance">Fridge Brilliance</a> is that, since his command lasted only a day, and an uneventful one (save for Flagg's visit) at that, Hawkeye didn't have to deal with the rigors of command that Blake went through on a day to day basis.
</li><li> Subverted in one episode where a group of British soldiers are brought in. Their wounds aren't life-threatening, but they're in a bad shape and need several weeks to recuperate. Their commanding officer shows up twice demanding that they be discharged and sent to the front as soon as possible, accusing them of laziness and calling Hawkeye a "mollycoddler". The third time he shows up, Hawkeye rushes to intervene, only to find him chatting amicably with the wounded, listening to their letters from home and generally acting like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>. When Hawkeye asks him what brought on this change, the officer replies that he would never speak the way he had to someone who was dying or seriously injured, and his men know him well enough to realise that, so when he comes in demanding they return to action immediately, it reassures them that they're going to be okay and they don't lose hope, which he describes as "being cruel to be kind". Furthermore, the officer's decency is proved when Hawkeye tells him that giving tea to soldiers with abdominal wounds is giving them peritonitis; he immediately agrees to follow the doctor's advice and stop the practice.

<ul><li> Arnold Rimmer is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">Subverted Trope</a>, as though having all the requisite personality traits, he lacks real authority, and the people he does outrank refuse to listen to him. Plus, he's dead already, so fragging's out of the question.
</li><li> He does once get command of a small army and actually manages to force a draw against a numerically superior enemy... though he did it by sacrificing all but two of his troops in a charge across an open minefield in broad daylight to serve as a distraction.
</li><li> To be accurate, he got <em>all</em> of his Wax Droid troops slaughtered. Most in the aforementioned mid-day minefield charge, several <em>melted</em> as a result of the training he put them through, and the sole survivor was dispatched as an assassin with the full understanding/intention that she would die in her mission of killing the Evil Wax Droid leaders. The only reason he was remotely able to claim this as a victory was because, while the enemy forces were distracted, Kryten was able to get to the planetary temperature controls and adjust the planet's heat so that all of the Wax Droids melted.

</div><ul><li> Further subverted in 'Balance of Power' in that Lister tried to outrank Rimmer by taking the chef's exam—the lowest rank on the ship that would still outrank Rimmer, and the one requiring the least effort to attain:
</li></ul><div class="indent"><strong>Rimmer</strong>: Chef? You want to become a chef?

Fortunately, everyone in North Fork realized how insane his military command was, and his superiors got a message from Lucas McCain about his incompetence, recalling the Major back to headquarters. However, the Major spun the story, claiming that his superiors needed his command elsewhere, even leaving his Lieutenant with this message: "Lieutenant, remember, the key to command is a firm hand, discipline!" Even more during the episode:
</li><li> He refused his men water (in the deserts of New Mexico) before the events of the episode, and one of his men was shot when he did steal some water, and the man's wound was not tended to, even in the jail. He was also set to be executed the next day. (He got better.)
</li><li> He mentioned how his men cracked under pressure from the enemy, costing him a promotion, when in fact he sent them in deliberately and they were shot to pieces.
</li><li> He called out one of his men for "resting" after a four-hour duty shift tending the jail his deserter was imprisoned in and ordered his Lieutenant to add another hour to his duty shift. (The man had collapsed from heat exhaustion.) Even the Major's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes-Man</a> Lieutenant started to question his command at this time, as he actually gave the man some water behind the Major's back.

This trope comes to the fore as a plot device in one episode when he becomes particularly inspired by <em>this trope</em> when a veteran lands in his hospital's care. The vet tells Kelso of his former sergeant's leadership, though ultimately the sergeant united the troops underneath him through their hate towards him. Against the backdrop of this, the hospital's productivity was falling as the staff were becoming to enveloped by an ongoing, literal coffeehouse debate around the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">war in Iraq</a>.

However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">ultimately subverts the trope</a> in that he takes it upon himself to be the one they can all hate in order to unite them on a common front.

After the first episode, the audience will assuredly hate him, and everything is set up to watch him fail in his mission while the primary Picard-is-captured plot yields the answer, showing him up. The second episode instead has him learn to loosen up just enough to recognize his flaws, and it's his tactics that not only win the day but save Picard in the process.

<ul><li> Captain Jasper Stone from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Deadlands">Deadlands</a></em> was a really bad version of this.

They are so cruel to their subordinates that said subordinates tend to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">gang up and murder them</a> whenever given half the chance.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Exalted">Exalted</a></em>:
<ul><li> Excessively righteous Blossom. His military career was marked by <em>repeatedly</em> getting a battalion whittled down to about company size, and he made it very clear to everyone who would listen that he viewed this as a result of the incompetence of his soldiers. Especially hilarious since he <em>is</em> very talented - at personal combat - but has exactly no ability to recognise what his talents <em>are</em>, leading to both military and civilian careers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DwarfFortress">crafted from incompetence and menacing with spikes of fail</a>.
</li><li> Tepet Lisara also qualifies. Out of jealousy, she got her cousin, an actually competent officer, removed from command, and devised the strategy that effectively ruined her House's standing within the Realm. Though that particular failure is never realized, she is still <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica">Reassigned to Antarctica</a> for general incompetence, where she delights in assigning up and coming male officers to menial or suicidal tasks for petty amusement.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/WarhammerFantasyBattle">Warhammer Fantasy Battle</a></em> 3rd Edition scenario "Fornerond's Last Stand", the High Elf general Fornerond Breezenimble (who happens to get killed immediately <em>before</em> the actual battle) is described to have been a completely incompetent nincompoop.
</li><li> Most of the Commissars in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a></em>. In fact, the 'Nam-inspired Catachan Jungle Fighters require a special saving roll before the game even starts to prevent them from fragging the Commissar (Oops, sorry sir!).
<ul><li> Similar to the Dinobots example listed below, one of the reasons Imperial doctrine normally prohibits <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceMarine">Space Marine</a> commanders from leading large-scale actions and campaigns in which the Marines and Imperial Guard fight together is that they tend to work the normal troops as hard as their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSoldier">Super Soldier</a> battle brothers, often with fatal results.
</li><li> Common Imperial Guard tactics employed usually boil down to "throw men at it by the regiment like a battering ram until it breaks." A noted battle cries of commissars is, "We will drown them in our blood and crush them under the weight of our own dead!"
</li><li> Every Imperial Guard officer above Lieutenant (and sometimes below) is either incompetent, a jerk, a glory hound, cowardly, or any combination of those. This goes up even into the Munitorium.
</li><li> The officers of the Death Korps of Krieg are a weird subversion- they are possibly the most brutal commanders in the Imperium and treat their men like they're completely expendable. But the men don't care because they believe they are expendable, a Korpsman's sole purpose is to take an enemy bullet and quietly die to make room for the next one. In Krieg regiments, the Commissar's job is to <em>prevent</em> soldiers getting themselves killed in pointless attacks.
</li><li> A Medal of Dishonor goes to Lord General Lugo, whose first act in <em>Honor Guard</em> is to order Gaunt and his men to step up their attack timetable to retake a holy temple, which subsequently explodes into a warp vortex (long story). He pins the whole thing on Gaunt and assigns Gaunt to lead a convoy as punishment. He shows up again in <em>Sabbat Martyr</em>, where he's playing a minor character from his previous appearance as the reincarnated Saint Sabbat. This time, however, fate bites him in the ass when the girl actually <em>becomes</em> the reincarnated saint (again, long story), and he spends much of the rest of the book standing around looking dumbstruck, which for him, is not much of a stretch.
</li><li> Subverted by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain">Ciaphas Cain</a>, naturally, who is certainly aware of this trope. He treats his men well and while he does genuinely care about them, he finds comfort in the fact that not being like every other Commissar in the guard greatly reduces his chance of being the victim of friendly fire. He actually comments on how a great many Commissars die "heroic deaths" suspiciously far from the front lines. He spent his later years attempting to teach commissar cadets to subvert this trope, with admittedly mixed success (most who are chosen for the Commissariat are simply not the right personality type to be taught how to lead through respect rather than fear). Cain certainly wants to avoid such a fate; "I want to die in a bed, preferably someone else's."
</li><li> Same goes for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt</a>.
</li><li> On the other hand, there's the legendary Lord Commander Solar Macharius, whose armies conquered a thousand worlds for the Emperor in the space of seven years. There's also Lord Castellan Ursarkar Creed of the Cadian 8th, Colonel "Iron Hand" Straken of Catachan, and Commissar Yarrick, who wears a Power Klaw he ripped off of an Ork Warboss, all of whom are competent and admired by their men.
</li><li> In the computer spin-off <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar">Dawn of War</a></em>, Imperial Priests often shout "WE LOST BECAUSE YOU'RE ALL WEAK!" when their squad regains morale.
</li><li> There was Commander Kubrik Chenkov of the Valhallan Ice Warriors is an extreme example of this. His main tactic is sending legions of his own men straight at the enemy base without tank or artillery support or using them to draw enemy fire for his other forces, but unlike most cases, his tactics really work.
</li><li> Similarly, some Space Marine commanders are capable of commanding large-scale operations; Marneus Calgar of the Ultramarines, Azrael of the Dark Angels, and Logan Grimnar of the Space Wolves have all had success in commanding Imperial Guard troops.

</li><li> Admiral Greyfield of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">Advance Wars: Days of Ruin</a></em>. A complete coward and a sub par commander who's greatest skills are taking credit for victories, and shifting blame for loses. He threatens executions for any failure to follow his orders to the letter, especially the order to win the battle. His cowardice is so much that he relentlessly hunts down any that don't adhere to absolute rule no matter how many of his own men are sacrificed or caught in the blast of the super weapon used to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoKillLikeOverkill">kill a single dissenting captain</a></span>, even resorting to executing enemies after surrender. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lin even implied that he was a subpar commander at best and faked his results.</span>
<ul><li> "Captain" Waylon (Note the quotation marks), who unsurprisingly ends up working for Greyfield, is another example.

First, if you've been playing the game long enough as soon as you start you can realize the whole city's been planned, all by him, in the <em>stupidest</em> of ways you'd only do if you had never played before, and passed the most authoritative, least supportive or helpful laws in the book that you cannot repeal, and <em>loved</em> enforcing them upon the populace. Then he drove the city's vital Generator (the one thing keeping the Antarctic-at-best temperatures at bay) to such extents and ignored so many warnings about it that he damaged it and nearly caused an explosion, and ordered half the city to be <em>executed on the streets</em> for rioting about it. And even after he got dragged out of office and repeatedly shot for being incompetent, the generator was so damaged its eventual explosion became inevitable, forcing everyone to either evacuate on a dreadnought with uncertain destination or freeze to death/<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPartyLikeADonnerParty">get eaten by men freezing to death</a>.

<ul><li> Mouri Motonari on the same game is even worse and has been around long before Mitsunari was included. Basically, this is a guy is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">a complete jerk</a> who pretty much treats his own soldiers as nothing but pawns that he can toss into the middle of fire of his plans, with them dying in friendly fire in his plans that will also decimate his enemy. And he will claim that it's all his genius that brings victory, rather than the commitment and the sacrifices of his soldiers, meaning that he hogs all the glory. The soldiers do not question his authority at all despite the mistreatment, because Motonari is that much of a battle genius that they have no hope of winning if they don't follow his orders. This is also portrayed in gameplay, as Motonari is one of the few characters whose attacks will affect and damage allied troops, a trait shared with the resident <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">Sadist</a> monster, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AkechiMitsuhide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AkechiMitsuhide">Akechi Mitsuhide</a>.

Kraze is more or less the same, but at least he <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he isn't given an option to be spared unlike most of the Imperial commanders</span>.
</li><li> Snowe from <em>Suikoden IV</em>. He gets severe shellshock in the first battle (on the first shot, no less), abandons his men, and develops a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a> complex in order to make up for it. And because of his lineage, gets promoted beyond his competency.

He constantly argues with the pilots (especially Excellen and Katina), is clearly jealous of Tetsuya (even though Lee outranks him and commands a ship), and fully cements himself as a Neidermeyer when he makes it clear that everyone is expendable, and he really doesn't care if any member of the crew lives or dies. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn">Then he just defects to the Shadow Mirrors</a>. Lee apparently lost his wife and parents during the events of the first game (6-months prior) and hasn't had time to deal with his grief. He's too much of an ass for fans to feel much sympathy towards, but it does help explain his irrational behavior.
</li><li> Due to the open ended nature of the story, it is entirely possible that both brothers in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> count as this.

In the end, however, he becomes arguably the most heroic character among the Americans followed by the narrative, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">volunteering to sacrifice himself to a friendly nuclear weapon so the approaching enemy will plow towards him into the blast radius, as retreating would've clued the Soviets in that something was wrong.</span>

At this point, it's hard to tell whether they are the exceptions or the rule. The actual racial leaders (with the exception of Garrosh Hellscream) tend to avoid this trope, but the player character frequently has to deal with various <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">NPCs</a>/questgivers that do fit the trope, especially on the Horde side.

This climaxes with his attack on Haven Academy; when cornered by Blake's citizen army and the Mistral police, his immediate response is to try to blow them all up, manhandling one of his men when he demands to know what he's doing, and when he's double-teamed by Blake and Sun and his men are being rounded up and arrested, he decides to simply run away. Ilia correctly predicts that after this, <em>no one</em> in the White Fang will follow or support Adam any longer.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers">The Transformers</a></em>:
<ul><li> Megatron was competent but selfish. This and his ego led him to do quite a few stupid things and abandoning Devastator in one episode. To be fair, it's really Starscream that was made out to be incompetent by the cartoon's writers, though his comic and toy bios show that he is far more brilliant.
</li><li> Starscream himself usually ends up as one of these whenever he's given the reigns. He's no fool, being very book-smart and a skilled fighter, but he's a roundly terrible commander; he often ends up getting betrayed or losing control of his own plots. The comic book <em>Spotlight: Megatron</em> shows the titular character being positively <em>enraged</em> at Starscream after he managed to, in three years of the former's absence, turn the aftermath of what had been a decisive and wide-ranging Decepticon victory into a complete rout that left troops cannibalizing each other to avoid starvation. A later comic, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersRobotsInDisguise" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTransformersRobotsInDisguise">The Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a></em>, however would reveal Starscream's true calling: politics.
</li><li> The real gem, however, is Galvatron. This insane psychotic warfreak shot at his own troops and did more damage to his own army than the Autobots. Needless to say, if it weren't for a number of certain extenuating circumstances, the Decepticons would have recycled Galvatron a long time ago, no matter how powerful he was. Said circumstances mainly being that, because of the backstabbing treachery endemic in their ranks, the first thing that would happen when Galvatron got slagged would be civil war breaking out due to there being no clear-cut successor to Galvatron's rank. And this would doubtlessly be fatal to the Decepticons, due to them being stuck on a burned-out world and barely scraping together enough fuel, parts, and ammo to survive from day to day.
</li><li> Sentinel Prime from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TransformersAnimated">Transformers Animated</a></em> is an example this kind of character among the <em>good guys</em>. Even in his younger days, he had zero respect for his peers, blaming the more responsible Optimus for Elita-1's presumed death (on an excursion that was <em>Sentinel's idea to begin with</em>), and as soon as he gained a command of his own, promptly began treating his men like worthless garbage, causing poor Bumblebee and Bulkhead much pain and suffering. He remains a jerk in the present day, taking every opportunity to viciously mock Optimus and his team's lower positions.
</li><li> Grimlock is occasionally shown to be a bit of a Neidermeyer in the comics when he's put in command of units other than the Dinobots, largely because most Autobots aren't used to doing things <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSpartanWay">The Spartan Way</a> like the Dinobots are and Grimlock being unwilling to accommodate them. When he briefly took over the Autobots he threw the rulebook out the window.
</li><li> Many sub-commanders within the Decepticons fit into this trope, but none moreso than Motormaster, leader of the Stunticons. His team is a big ball of crazy, and he loves to do things like order the silence-fearing Wildrider to remain quiet on missions. The intense loathing that the rest of the Stunticons have for Motormaster causes their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombiningMecha">combined form Menasor</a> to be utterly uncontrollable as <em>none</em> of his component minds are able to work with their leader's.

<ul><li> George Armstrong Custer:
<ul><li> He was a glory-seeking General that lost his wits, every man in the Seventh Cavalry, and his life in the campaign that led to Little Big Horn. And he got in that mess from an increasingly frantic and frustrated desire for glory to turn to into a political advantage, no matter how many tribes or soldiers died to get it!
</li><li> However, one incident that is largely forgotten is that Custer almost singlehandedly prevented a massacre when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralRipper">Philip Sheridan</a> ordered an assault against the starved, exhausted and defenseless remnants of the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House. Custer, realizing that the surviving Confederates were in no physical or emotional condition to fight anyone and were completely encircled, rode in front of the Union Army frantically trying to stop the attack. Custer's actions managed to delay the attack long enough for the famous surrender to be negotiated. Custer may have been a psychotic nut-case but he had nothing on Sheridan.
</li><li> Custer led a cavalry force of 700 men to take out Sitting Bull and the 800 natives who had left a reservation. Ignoring his scouts (members of the Crow tribe) who told him the village they spotted had <strong>thousands</strong> of women and children and probably an equal number of warriors, he split his force in half to "trap" the enemy. Custer's own group, about 200 soldiers personally led by him, would end up facing at least 1800 Native American warriors, warriors who had just fought off the other half of his armed force which had attacked the village. The only survivor from Custer's group was a horse called Commanche which had nearly a dozen wounds from bullets, arrows and spears. What everyone always forgets is that he was a Colonel at this point, having been a General in the Civil War, and wanted to regain his rank!
</li><li> Custer had problems even before Little Big Horn: suspension from duty for a year for being AWOL, misappropriation of funds meant for provisions for reservation Indians, and during Reconstruction duty in Texas he only narrowly escaped being fragged by his own troops (namely, the 2nd Wisconsin Cavalry, of which Custer had been given command and who resented his attempts at discipline). He was routinely called a 'dandy' and 'Ringlets' by his men as a result of his obsession with his personal appearance. Little Big Horn itself was the result of Custer's insubordination and happened when Custer and his men deserted their commanding officer (Custer had earlier been denied independent command because of his continued use of his position and his men for political lobbying).
</li><li> At least one historian has suggested that Custer's legendary recklessness was the result of a "Death Wish" caused by Custer's discovery that he was suffering from syphilis, which at the time was incurable, ultimately fatal, and caused delusions of grandeur and obsessive-compulsive behaviour.
</li></ul></li><li> In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> General Lloyd Fredendall was one of the original commanders of Operation Torch (the American invasion of North Africa). Once on the ground in Africa Fredendall had his headquarters built 70 miles behind the front lines, which was viewed as cowardly by both the troops under his command and by his peers and superiors. From there he proceeded to issue unsound commands that showed little grasp of military tactics, including a tendency to place infantry in positions where they could not receive decent air or artillery support. By most reports Fredendall was a swaggering, cocky man who did not listen to his subordinates. Even more unfortunately, his adversary in the campaign was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagnificentBastard">General Erwin Rommel</a> and his famed Afrika Korps. After the American defeat at Kasserine Pass, Fredendall was relieved of command and replaced by George Patton, after which American forces actually started experiencing success in North Africa. The irony is that Fredenhall was an excellent logistician. He was sent back to Stateside, where he made more for the Army logistics than any other general.
</li><li> Patton himself has been accused of being more than a little of a martinet, far too concerned with the dress code in a combat zone (including the fact he demanded, and may even have gotten, front-line infantry to wear their ties), attacking Metz and the Vauban forts without proper preparation and demanding the attack continue after it became clear it was not going to succeed, and finally culminating late in the war with his famous tirade against a soldier who had been shot in the foot for cowardice (said soldier had already won a Silver Star for valor).
<ul><li> Sergeant Bill Mauldin's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/WillieAndJoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/WillieAndJoe">Willie And Joe</a> called him on his uniform obsession multiple times, eventually leading to Patton threatening to shut down <em>Stars and Stripes</em> altogether to stop troops from reading the strip. Eisenhower himself stepped in and shut Patton down over this, and ordered Patton to leave Mauldin strictly alone. Eisenhower understood that the Willie and Joe comics (which depicted a pair of low-ranking infantry soldiers on the front lines) were very good for morale <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors">and that Mauldin himself was highly regarded by the enlisted men</a>.
</li><li> Despite his dress code obsession however, Patton was very much a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a> in every other area. He displayed high favor to the frontline troops of his command, diverting provisions (such as wine, magazines and any type of recreational material) to them, preferred leading from the front whenever he could afford to and, when on the few occasions when he realized he was in the wrong (such as the aforementioned accusation of cowardice), he would apologize and try to make things right as best as he could. As well, in spite of being somewhat racist (his family did descend from the Confederate South after all), Patton was among the first US Army commanders to show favor toward the African American troops of his command, both through emphasizing their importance and performance as soldiers to even going as far as having black judges assigned to any courts martial involving black soldiers. Generally (pardon the expression), Patton was more of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a> with some Neidermeyer traits than one or the other.
</li><li> Patton's diversion of provisions had a darker side, however, as he diverted them <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightHandVersusLeftHand">from other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">Allied armies</a></em>. His own army loved him, but <em>everyone else</em> hated him for stealing their food and leaving their men hungry... and unable to advance due to petrol and ammo shortages, leaving Patton's troops the only ones able to do so. This would've been alright if he'd been acting in the general interests of the entire Allied war effort, but 'make me look good' and 'win the war' are not compatible <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics">strategic-operational objectives</a>. Sadly, like <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NoMoreEmperors">Joseph Stilwell</a> and Douglas MacArthur, Patton could not (easily) be fired because he had an extremely cosy relationship with the media and was very popular. Had he not died in an auto accident shortly after the end of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, he probably would have gone out like MacArthur. Namely, dismissed for being a political liability who put his own military glory first, and global consequences, no matter how dire, second.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/DouglasMacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a> had the abrasiveness and ego down pat, and his handling of the fall of the Philippines and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a> make his competence in doubt. Though it was not well known at the time (the US media loved portraying him as a messiah), MacArthur was more concerned with his personal image than <em>almost</em> anything else. Everything from his famous shades and corncob pipe image to his style of command and administration, from his tenure as Superintendent at West Point to Korea, were designed primarily for his personal glory. As well, he was infamously (within the US Army) prone to shower favor on toadies and surround himself with them and ignore constructive criticism. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">His hatred of the Navies</a> under his command was also infamous, and after his victory over Japan and tenure as "Shogun" there, he let a lot of his prior flaws bubble to his head and blow themselves out of proportion, which was a major reason why the early stages of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/KoreanWar">Korean War</a> went as badly for the Western Allies as they did. Ultimately, "Dougout Doug" really was that badass on a lot of occasions, and he did truly care for his men, but it had to be pretty bad for those traits to become less visible than his glory seeking.
<ul><li> In command of Australians, he had none on his staff. In New Guinea he never visited the front lines and thus never recognized how difficult the terrain was. Which led, on multiple occasions, to his relieving officers who were just about to win their battles because he felt they were doing it too slowly.
</li><li> MacArthur <em>did</em> manage to reform West Point, updating its curriculum for the first time in over a century using the lessons learned from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> (in which he was a genuinely effective <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelBadass">Colonel Badass</a>).

Her Neidermeyer behavior includes:
<ul><li> When approached for advice by a junior officer, Graf allegedly responded with "Don't come to me with your problems. You're a fucking department head", and later "I can't express how mad you make me without getting violent!"
</li><li> Started a (confirmed) drag race with another destroyer that nearly resulted in a collision; the ships came within 300 feet of each other. A <a class="urllink" href="http://www.militarycorruption.com/Images/near-miss.jpg">photo<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> from the deck of Graf's ship shows the vessel heading straight toward the other. To make it worse, when the bridge crew went to sound a collision alarm (so all hands could brace and ready repairs), Graf ordered them to not sound the alarm. Such an alarm, after all, would have to be noted in the ship's logs. That would mean she'd have to explain why she endangered two very expensive ships and a couple hundred lives in a pissing contest.
</li><li> Tired of delays leaving a port, she ordered that the ship accelerate to 25 knots instead of 10, despite being informed it was dangerous to do so. As a result, the <em>Cowpens</em> ran soft aground and mangled the ship's propulsion screws. She then allegedly grabbed a British exchange officer by either the throat or the lapels (accounts differ), and began shouting "Did you run my fucking ship aground?!" She then went on to order the crew to falsify records and claim they were moving at 10 knots.
</li><li> Allegedly covered up the fact that her ship had struck a whale by ordering the crew into lockdown and temporarily terminating e-mail privileges.
</li><li> Graf was such a dick to so many people that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">the crew supposedly began cheering</a> when another officer arrived on the USS <em>Winston Churchill</em> to relieve and replace her.
</li><li> When the Asst. Secretary of the Navy decided she did nothing to earn anything less than an <a class="urllink" href="http://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/01/navy-fired-cowpens-co-to-get-honorable-retirement-010612/">honorable discharge<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li></ul></li><li> Captain Bligh had a reputation for this, but it's not really deserved: Yes, he flogged his men, but it was only because flogging was the mandatory punishment in the British Navy at the time. In fact, he was considered <em>lenient</em> compared to the other officers in the Navy. Yes, conditions were overcrowded on the <em>Bounty</em>, but only because Bligh couldn't say no to friends and relatives who needed jobs for their friends and relatives. And when they finally got to Otaheite (later Tahiti), Bligh let his men run around and do whatever they wanted for the five months they remained. The conditions that led to the famous mutiny were largely made out of a desperate need to get his by-now rather lax crew into some semblance of order and competency. In short, the supposed tyrant's greatest crime was being too accommodating.
<ul><li> Plus, after their mutiny, the crew returned to Tahiti and began treating the natives little better than slaves. Eventually the natives rebelled and killed nearly all of them.
</li><li> The famed Mutiny on the <em>Bounty</em> was not the last time Bligh faced a mutiny of those under him. His overly strict and by the book attempts to enforce discipline when he was made Governor of New South Wales sparked off the <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_Rebellion">Rum Rebellion<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.
</li><li> Honestly, Bligh actually genuinely aspired to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AFatherToHisMen">A Father to His Men</a>. He had served under Captain Cook during Cook's famed expeditions to Hawaii, and learned much on how to run a ship under him. He packed foods, such as sauerkraut that were reputed to help ward off scurvy, and as noted above, flogged where legally demanded and not "just because", and often commuted capital offenses to flogging when he could. His failings were a very harsh tongue and something of a taskmaster mentality.
</li><li> As for competence: After being ejected from the <em>Bounty</em> with the crew that stayed loyal, Bligh sailed an overcrowded ship's boat with little food and water and the crudest of navigational aids on a massive journey across open seas to reach modern-day Indonesia, with the loss of only one crew member. The other men on the boat acknowledged that it was due to Bligh's nautical skills.
</li><li> Bligh's discipline also ensured that the sick and weak were not abandoned to their fate but were the first to get fed when the boat's crew managed to kill a seabird etc.
</li></ul></li><li> Hermann Goering, by 1945, was called the most hated man in Germany because of his obsession with fame, glory, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a> and rampant egomania. Given <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseWackyNazis">the competition</a> at the time, it's quite an achievement. Göring was a perfect example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">The Peter Principle</a>. A brilliant <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Ace Pilot</a> (22 victories and Blue Max) and a competent wing commander, he found his level of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">total incompetentness</a> as Reichsmarschall. His desire to have <em>his</em> Luftwaffe deal the killing blow to the BEF instead of the regular army was one of the reasons they were able to evacuate at Dunkirk to fight another day. His later attempt to resupply the trapped 6th Army at Stalingrad by air despite the Luftwaffe never being designed around such a mission, let alone one at the limits of their own supply chain and incredibly harsh winter weather conditions, only resulted in a disorganized mess that not only failed to save 6th Army but cost large numbers of planes and pilots lost in the effort. When the regime was on it's last legs, he unsuccessfully tried to usurp power from Hitler at the last second, and was unrepentant during his trial for war crimes, firmly believing history would vindicate him as a German national hero.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdolfHitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. By the end of the War, many of his own men—particularly his generals—wanted him dead more than the Allies due to his repeated strategic blunders (the Allies stopped trying to kill him, fearing someone <em>competent</em> would take his place). Indeed, a few senior officers such as Claus von Stauffenberg, (many of them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OfficerAndAGentleman">Junkers</a>-contrary to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziNobleman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaziNobleman">common belief</a>, the German nobility generally disdained or even outright hated Hitler, who returned the sentiment), participated with <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_Plot">a plot to assassinate Hitler<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> in 1944. It failed. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">On the bright side</a>, it inspired the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Valkyrie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Valkyrie">Valkyrie</a></em>.
<ul><li> After the defeat in Stalingrad (a defeat that occurred purely due to Hitler's personal strategic intervention) Hitler went from "makes unreasonable demands and interferes in well made plans" to "detached from reality". The famous stories from his war room are that he would regularly issue orders to units that no longer existed or were so undermanned they might as well not exist, then when his plans didn't work out, would blame the subordinate who was "responsible". Most Generals were lucky enough that they would simply be demoted or put somewhere out of the way (legendary General Guderian was one example), however some were not so lucky and would be executed for cowardice or "defying orders".
</li><li> One well-known story from the war is that when the Normandy invasion began, Panzer groups sat idly by while the Allies invaded. The reason? Because they needed Adolf's ordered permission to get into the battle. He did not give it until late in the day, because <em>he was asleep</em>. And <em>nobody</em> wanted to be the one to wake him up and tell him the bad news.
</li></ul></li><li> Captain Herbert Sobel, former commander of E Company, 2nd Battalion, 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101 Airborne. He was incompetent, petty, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrillSergeantNasty">Drill Sergeant Nasty</a>, and a complete <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>. Many say that his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon">Moral Event Horizon</a> was raiding his troop's rooms and confiscating everything from magazines to non-regulation clothing. When he was replaced, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndThereWasMuchRejoicing">everybody was happy</a>. While he was almost universally hated by every man who trained under him, those same men almost universally say that it was Sobel who made E Company into the elite unit it was <em>because</em> of his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a>, overly harsh treatment. (Yes, the portrayal of him in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BandOfBrothers">Band of Brothers</a></em> is widely agreed to be <em>perfectly accurate</em>.)
<ul><li> An even more infamous example from the same war and company (and eventual miniseries) is 1st Lt. Norman Dike. He's been accused of delegating all duty to lower officers and NCOs during his tenure, and for disappearing from the front lines for hours at a time during the Battle of the Bulge; many of the men under (and over) him accused him of simply using the E Company assignment as a way to get "field experience" before continuing his climb up the ladder. Most infamous, however, is his historically-documented <em>meltdown</em> during the assault on Foy, Belgium. While trying to lead E Company on the Foy attack, he completely froze up from terror and was unable to give any commands at all, aside from one order for Easy to halt their advance into the town... in the middle of an open field. He was famously relieved of duty by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticBadass">Ronald Spiers</a>, who would go on to lead E Company to victory in Foy. After this incident, Dike was quickly drummed out of the Airborne and was lucky to not be kicked out of the Army wholesale. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/TheOtherWiki">The Other Wiki</a> implies he had fought bravely and well in Normandy and got wounded twice. It is assumable he had become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran">Shell-Shocked Veteran</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> This happens often when the former military people end up in the areas where the less straightforward methods are the norm. A good IT example would be Bob Belleville, Apple's Software Manager for the original Macintosh development team. The guy was an alumnus of the same Xerox PARC lab as were most other Mac people, but his stint in the Navy had shifted his priorities somewhat. He once almost fired one of the critical OS developers over a dispute about the crucial part of software he felt was unneeded, and drove the chief OS architect to tears and filing his resignation (during the critical period of the OS development) because of his supposed <em>insubordination</em>. In both cases only a good chewing out by Steve Jobs himself made him relent somewhat.
<ul><li> A common problem with former military <em>is</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrangerInAFamiliarLand">re-socializing to the civilian world</a>. Once you spend a long enough time in, it takes time to get used to the less formal (in appearance) environment of the civilian workforce. There are reasons why former military are often seen in jobs with known chains of command.
</li><li> People who worked for Steve Jobs and left tend to have this view of him, considering his high standards. But since he led Apple from nearly dead in the water to having more liquid assets than the US government in 10 years, people skirt by this.
</li></ul></li><li> Virtually every officer in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">Imperial Japanese</a> military, in large part due to their brutal discipline and rigid stratification between enlisted and officer ranks. Imperial officers and NCOs were supposed to make their men fear them more than they feared the enemy. This tended to backfire in the Air services because the more experienced enlisted pilots would simply abandon officers that they didn't like; actual fragging was normally unnecessary since being alone in a dogfight usually meant you were dead meat. According to one surviving enlisted pilot, unpopular officers "often failed to come back."
</li><li> Similarly, virtually every officer in the pre-Russo-Japanese war <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TsaristRussia">Tsarist Russian</a> military, because of the brutal means of discipline and strict social class differences. Almost all officers came from the privileged nobility, while the enlisted men were almost all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveMook">force-levied conscripts</a>. One particular example was Lieutenant Ippolit Giliarovsky on pre-dreadnought battleship <em>Potemkin</em>, whose uppity, cocky and bullying behaviour sparked the mutiny immortalized on Sergei Eisenstein's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleshipPotemkin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BattleshipPotemkin">Battleship Potemkin</a></em>.
<ul><li> Note that this had changed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, largely as a result of the reforms that came in the wake of the embarrassing stalemate that was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ImperialJapan">the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5</a>. In 1913, 40% of the Officer Academies' graduates were landless gentry (i.e. families with titles, but little or no money), and another 40% were of the lower-middle class and peasantry. Only 20% of graduates were from land-owning and/or middle-middle-to-upper-class families. This was a drastically lower proportion than in Germany, wherein the Army's officer corps was overwhelmingly aristocratic. Unlike in contemporary Germany, the Imperial Russian army was actually a means for 'upward' social mobility. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritsWithBattleships">Royal Navy</a> officers, who served as liaison officers, were appalled by the Russian Imperial Navy's brutal discipline and the incompetence of the officers. The Russian Imperial Navy used corporal punishments, which had been abandoned already in the Napoleonic times in the Royal Navy. The disaster in the Russo-Japanese war forced the Russians to reform.
</li><li> The Soviet military was markedly better, as the Soviet Union placed extremely heavy emphasis on military preparedness after the 22nd of July 1941 (for understandable reasons). However, a culture of <em>dedovschina</em> ('rule of the grandfathers') developed, whereby senior conscripts were encouraged by the hierarchy to inflict extremely brutal hazing and bullying upon junior conscripts. The practice is responsible for as many as 3,000 deaths per year, although the Russian Defense Ministry classifies most of those as 'suicides'. The practice was partly responsible for the <em><a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strozhevoi_mutiny">Strozhevoi<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> Mutiny, the attempted defection of a Soviet frigate to Sweden in 1975. Lowering the mandatory service period from two years to one year has eased the problem somewhat, but it still remains endemic to the Russian military even in the post-Soviet era.
<ul><li> The Russian military makes zero attempt to investigate the deaths of or get autopsies on its recruits, unless they exceed 3 deaths per 500 personnel per month. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoronerDothProtestTooMuch">Even so, the investigations are not renowned for their thoroughness or impartiality.</a>
</li><li> It doesn't help that the Soviet military set the standard for placing "politically reliable" (i.e. regime loyal) officers to high command positions over those who possessed real skills. This resulted in the Soviet General Staff becoming top heavy with Neidermeyers who were more concerned with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlingOfWar">Bling of War</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilesGloriosus">Miles Gloriosusism</a> than commanding soldiers effectively, in turn leading to the stereotype of communist militaries being led by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failures</a> who were either fanatical or had gained their position through Party connections (namely through familial relations). An attempted balance for this was capital punishment (such as firing squads) being the standard reprisal for failure (infamous Dmitry Pavlov, whose Western Special Military District bore the brunt of the German offensive in 1941, as a prime example); however, this practice was abandoned soon after first Soviet defeats in 1941, when Stalin learnt that his supply of competent officers is not unlimited.
</li></ul></li><li> This attitude affected even the competent Soviet Generals, such as Marshal Zhukov. They were aware that if they preserved the lives of their men at the cost of victory, their own necks would be in line. So they would often opt for very costly victories in men and material even for relatively insignificant gains. This would affect their postwar reputations: when Zhukov was in favor, he was the great military leader who won the war; when he wasn't, he was the butcher whose victories were built on a lot of needless sacrifice.
</li></ul></li><li> Soviet General Grigory Kulik had a reputation of being erratic and a murderous buffoon. His personal command motto was: "Jail, or Medal." People under his command who he favored would receive (undeserved) honors, while those he didn't would be arrested for whatever reason he could think of. He would then shout his motto at his 'favored' subordinates to intimidate them if they were starting to displease him. Not only this, he was a stupendously inept officer who had no understanding of tactics and resisted all military innovations (such as tanks, rocket artillery, minefields, and sub-machine guns, all of which were effective). The only reason he survived for so long when other much more competent generals did not was because he himself had the personal favor of Stalin. He finally lost it after the end of WWII, when he was overheard criticizing Stalin. He was soon arrested, and eventually executed.
</li><li> Second Lieutenant William Calley, commanding officer of the platoon that perpetrated the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">My Lai massacre</a>, was regarded as incompetent (for starters, he couldn't even read a map or compass properly) and there had been discussions already within the platoon of fragging him. It's occasionally been noted that Calley was a product of Robert S. MacNamara's "Project 100,000," which sought to expand the US Army's numbers cheaply by lowering standards across the board. Had it not been for that failed initiative, most agree that Calley wouldn't have even been allowed in the Army, much less put in charge of anything.
<ul><li> And his superior, Captain Ernest Medina, was little better. Medina was a martinet who openly harassed Calley, pushing him over the edge. It is suggested Medina himself ordered My Lai to be destroyed. Medina was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">excellent NCO but a complete failure as an officer</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> In the recently-published book <em>The Generals</em> by Thomas Ricks, the argument is made that the general officer corps of the US Army is overloaded with Neidermeyers (and several from World War Two to Iraq and Afghanistan are described), and it's only because of the competence of the enlisted, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">NCOs</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatherToHisMen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatherToHisMen">good junior officers</a> that this hasn't become more obvious.
<ul><li> However, the wheels are starting to come off, and it's too late to tighten the lug nuts. Junior officers and senior NCO's, aware that the military is downsizing and completely fed up with incompetent leadership where the Neidermeyer is far too common, are hitting the door in <em>droves.</em> A great deal of their frustration was succinctly summed up in a devastating article written by an <em>active duty</em> lieutenant colonel. He boldly and honestly stated that a soldier who lost a rifle faced far greater consequences than a general who lost a battle or a war. Further, he observed that generals and admirals who commit rape and sexual harassment are protected by a "good old boys" system that ensures the worst that will happen to them is retirement with full pay and benefits. He ended the article by saying that junior personnel are fully aware that their leadership will throw them under a bus without a moment's hesitation.
</li></ul></li><li> The term 'fragging' refers to dispatching an unpopular military officer with a fragmentation grenade. The reasoning was that bullets could be traced to individual rifles, but grenades could not, and would destroy other physical evidence. Apparently the process was that a verbal, informal mention of difficulties with an officer would be made. The next step was to place a grenade pin on the officer's pillow or other conspicuous place for him to find. If the message still wasn't coming across, a real grenade WITHOUT a pin would be placed in the general vicinity of the officer. In addition, apparently, the standing orders for a squad in Vietnam if their officer was killed was to return to base. Soldiers on a suicidal or otherwise dangerous mission sometimes were able to figure out the math on that one. They would skip the buildup with particularly incompetent, glory-crazed, or just plain abusive officers; if you were a big enough dick to your men or senselessly jeopardized their lives enough, odds are that a live grenade would just suddenly materialize in your tent and explode out of the blue, and no one would have any insight into how it happened.
</li><li> To US Airmen in Tech School (AF advanced training), "Ropes" often fall under this trope. Basically, they are to the USAF what prefects are to British schools - fellow students who come off as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GungHolierThanThou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GungHolierThanThou">Gung Holier Than Thou</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RulesLawyer">Rules Lawyers</a>, <em>and</em> can get you in trouble for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor">even minor violations</a> since becoming a "Rope" gives them a measure of authority to rat their fellow Airmen out to the sergeants.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CheGuevara" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CheGuevara">Ernesto "Che" Guevara</a> was like this about half of the time more or less, depending on the source. While he was occasionally known for showing reckless bravery and some decent planning, at other times he was notably incompetent, fled from battle, and generally was a burden to his men. And he was verbally abusive to his men almost all the time and generally showed a disdain for "Bourgeoise tactics" that hardly helped matters at all. He is perhaps most infamously known for his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastStand">"last stand"</a>, where according to most accounts he left the rest of his unit to fight it out against the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BolivianArmyEnding">Bolivian soldiers attacking him</a> before surrendering afterwards with two loaded and primed pistols. Though to be fair, he did surrender only after taking two bullets, and his last remaining comrade fought to the end to protect him. Despite leading revolutionaries in Africa, Guevara was overheard to disparage his local African fellow travelers, stating that black people did not have the intelligence to make communism work, and placing Afro-Cubans in his command over the native Congolese.
</li><li> A much-disliked pilot in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm, renowned for bratty manner, overloading his crew with irrational and unnecessary demands, and other failings in human management, insisted his hangar crew rename his plane after his girlfriend. He was not nice about it and did not ask - he ordered. The irritated crew painted the name "Phyllis" on the nose of his plane as ordered. The pilot pronounced himself satisfied. After a discreet interval, the letters "SY-" were painted in front of the name. The pilot did not notice. Everyone else on the carrier did.
</li><li> Lord Cardigan of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrimeanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheCrimeanWar">The Crimean War</a> infamy provides a particularly odious example. He purchased the Lieutenant Colonelcy of the 15th Hussars, despite a complete lack of military experience (bypassing the regiment's senior Major, who'd fought at Waterloo and served for 30 years), and almost immediately transferred to the 11th Hussars through disagreements with his officers. Besides being a harsh drillmaster and disciplinarian he frequently antagonized his subordinates, especially those who'd served in India. He shot one officer in a duel, tried to cashier another for serving moselle at a champagne dinner and had a secretary record the private conversations of his subordinates. Cardigan's wartime leadership of the Light Cavalry Brigade wasn't especially distinguished, leading them on a pointless reconnaissance that achieved little but exhausting the men and losing valuable horses. While he showed courage during the Brigade's famous charge, he turned back immediately after reaching the Russian guns, believing it ungentlemanly to fight amongst private soldiers. Soon after he returned to England and was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickedUpstairs">Kicked Upstairs</a> rather than given another field command.
</li><li> Italy's own <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Cadorna">Luigi Cadorna<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was a strict disciplinarian whose main tactic was to have his men charge into the enemy lines... And he was the <em>commander-in-chief</em> at the start of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a>, succeeding a much more loved general who had died by heart attack. For obvious reasons he got ultimately sacked, and his name is still hated in Italy. Ironically, he also had a large share of the merit for Italy's ultimate victory on their front, as he understood the devastating power of artillery and machine guns from the start and, fighting his own <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat">Obstructive Bureaucrats</a>, managed to reform the army to take advantage of the machine guns and equipped it with one of the largest artillery parks in the war, meaning that, by the time he got sacked, all Italy needed to win was a competent general as commander-in-chief, and his replacement was rather good.
</li><li> <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius_Arnheiter">Marcus Aurelius Arnheiter<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, dangerously close to a real-life Captain Queeg. Commanding a destroyer escort during the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VietnamWar">Vietnam War</a>, he alienated his crew with bombastic religious services, obsessive attention to detail and harsh disciplinary actions. Like the fictional Queeg, he so alienated his crewmen that they started keeping a log of his irrational actions. Two particular sore points involved the color of Arnheiter's toilet seat, and his apparent breakdown in combat. Eventually, Arnheiter's superiors received enough complaints that they relieved him of command. However, Arnheiter appealed the decision and the resultant legal procedings and press coverage proved a huge embarrassment to the Navy.
</li><li> Leslie Gehres, captain of <em><a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Franklin_%28CV-13%29">USS Franklin<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em>, was a good example of a Captain Queeg. His crew regarded him poorly due to his disciplinarian attitude and open contempt for his crew. When <em>Franklin</em> suffered a pair of devastating bomb hits on March 19, 1945, Gehres had refused to change the ship's readiness level from Condition-3 despite being only 50 miles from the Japanese coast. Antiaircraft guns were unmanned, damage control personnel were eating breakfast, fire pumps were turned off, and fully-loaded aircraft on the hangar deck were ignited by the bombs in a catastrophic explosion. Gehres spent six hours doing nothing of any use while his ship burned and explosive ordnance cooked off inside. Instead, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassPreacher">Chaplain Joseph O'Callahan</a> led the firefighting and rescue effort that saved the ship, pulling many wounded men away from the fires by himself, pausing only to issue the Last Rites to the many dead and dying. Gehres later tried to deflect blame by accusing many of the surviving crew of desertion in the face of the enemy for abandoning the ship (a capital offense punishable by death) in spite of the fact that they were forced (or blown) overboard by the explosions and fire. The Navy quickly dropped the charges and swept the accusation under the rug. Gehres received a medal but was never trusted to command a ship again. Chaplain O'Callahan received the Medal of Honor.
</li><li> General <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol_%C5%9Awierczewski">Karol Świerczewski<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> was hailed as a hero by post-war Soviet propaganda and made the protagonist of many (completely fictitious) war stories, but in reality, he was an utter <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">General Failure</a> who repeatedly displayed complete lack of strategic skills (employing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodTactics">Hollywood Tactics</a> some of which would make <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">even the actual Hollywood writers cringe</a>) as well as total disregard of life and well-being of soldiers under his command. On top of that, he was a borderline alcoholic who — according to many accounts — even led his battles while drunk. The list of his military blunders is too long to put it here, but the worst and most egregious one is arguably the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bautzen_(1945)">Battle of Bautzen<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, which took place in final days of World War Two. Świerczewski, who was in charge of Polish Second Army at that time, figured he could seize some glory for himself by capturing Dresden ahead of schedule. To achieve that goal, he ignored the directives given to him by his superiors and rushed his armored divisions forward, seeing no need to keep his forces in formation and close to each other. As a result, he needlessly stretched the entire army and formed huge gaps between separate units. Tanks speeding towards Dresden had no support of infantry, which in turn was left behind and had no protection of tanks, while artillery had no proper cover nor could it render support to other units. No second guesses what happened when Germans launched a counter-attack and their recon noticed those gaps. The resulting bloodbath wiped out over twenty-two percent of entire Second Army in but a few days and is still deemed one of the worst and most humiliating defeats in history of Polish military. It was salvaged from total disaster only by timely intervention of Marshal Ivan Konev. To make matters worse, Świerczewski <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaHoudini">never got his comeuppance</a> and was promoted shortly after the battle.
</li><li> Where to begin with Sam Hughes, the Canadian Minister of Militia during World War I?
<ul><li> When Canada became caught up in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheSecondBoerWar">The Second Boer War</a>, Hughes nearly ruined the Canadian Minister of Militia's efforts to send a contingent of troops to South Africa by making the plan public, before he committed insubordination as a militia officer by publicly criticizing his commander. He then constantly committed insubordination <em>again</em> when he was actually in South Africa, repeatedly insulting the British commanders until they had enough and shipped him back to Canada. He also developed an unhealthy obsession with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns">the Ross rifle</a>, and repeatedly campaigned for not one but <em>two</em> Victoria Crosses;
</li><li> When the Conservatives under Robert Borden formed government in 1911, Hughes demanded to be made Minister of Militia. Borden had severe reservations about doing so, but felt he owed Hughes a political debt. As Minister, Hughes was infamous for his lavish spending on junkets and patronage. By 1913, Borden was so frustrated with Hughes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallNameBigEgo">Small Name, Big Ego</a> behaviour that he wanted to fire him, but didn't think he could;
</li><li> Hughes proved to be an arrogant, bigoted <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass">Jerkass</a> Orange Protestant who hated Francophones and Catholics-a very bad thing for a country where Francophones and Catholics were a very large minority. Hughes badly alienated many or Francophones and Catholics, making them less willing to enlist in the Canadian Forces, further inflaming already-high linguistic tensions when World War I broke out.
</li><li> During World War I, Hughes dispensed government supply contracts to his friends, forcing Canadian soldiers to go into battle <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisHerring">poorly equipped with boots that fell apart at the slightest wear, "shield shovels" that failed both as shields and as shovels</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShurFineGuns">and the infamous Ross rifle, which constantly jammed and misfired in the muddy trenches.</a> It got so bad that Canadian soldiers would steal the Lee-Enfield rifles off dead British soldiers whenever they could.
</li><li> Hughes also disposed command positions based on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nepotism">Nepotism</a> rather than merit, including to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpperClassTwit">Upper-Class Twit</a> son Garnet. Garnet Hughes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ModernMajorGeneral">Modern Major General</a> performance as a commander led <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourStarBadass">Sir Arthur Currie</a> to consider him incompetent under fire and a danger to the troops he led.
</li><li> Hughes pigheadedly insisted on retaining the Ross rifle as the major Canadian weapon despite its uselessness. Suggesting that it be replaced became a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton">Berserk Button</a> for him. Hughes' general adminstration was incredibly inefficient and wasteful, and he became loathed by the common soldiers;
</li><li> Hughes' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairTriggerTemper">Hair-Trigger Temper</a> led him to insult everyone from the professional soldiers and officers he commanded to civilian critics to even Borden himself, which finally led to Borden firing him. By that point, he had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeroPercentApprovalRating">0% Approval Rating</a> with everyone from King George V on down to the common soldiers in the field loudly criticizing him.
