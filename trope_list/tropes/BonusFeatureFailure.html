<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Civilization">Civilization V</a></em>, the Iroquois unique ability, <em>The Great Warpath</em> allows you to traverse between forests and jungles as if they were roads but that feature only works if you traverse through the forests and jungles, entering them still requires full movement points making this bonus virtually useless. Another downside is that forests do not really provide that much food for your own city thus making growth difficult. Their unique building, the longhouse also lacks the scaling production bonus effect in favor of a measly production bonus on forest tiles meaning that for the longhouse to work, you need to keep almost all of the forests alive meaning your cities will rarely grow tall. All in all, they are one of the few civilizations whose bonuses directly detriments the civilization growth. Compare the Celt's <em>Druidic Lore</em> ability which gives +1/+2 Faith per city near unimproved forests (which gives them an edge as a Religious Civ) and Brazil's unique "Brazilwood Camp" improvement, which gives a +2 Gold improvement on the Jungle tile (and +2 culture with acoustics as Brazilwood is used for instruments) while <em>keeping the Jungle tile intact</em> which gives the tile a total output of 2 Food, Science, Gold, and Culture.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> The final reward for the Gold Skulltula sidequest is an unlimited supply of money. By that point, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoneyForNothing">you have almost no use for it</a>.
</li><li> The Ice Arrows serve no purpose except to freeze enemies (an action you can do with other items that don't require depleting your magic meter); even if they had an use, it's obtained very late because it requires items housed in end-game dungeons. The game even lampshades this via a Gossip Stone located in Desert Colossus. In <em>Majora's Mask</em>, the Ice Arrows are legitimately useful, but only because they were upgraded to a progression-critical item, so they're no longer a bonus feature to begin with.
</li><li> The Stone of Agony, which is obtained by collecting 20 gold Skulltula tokens. It causes the rumble pak to vibrate if you're near a hidden hole that can be revealed with a bomb. Naturally, the feature is completely useless if you don't own a rumble pak. The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/VirtualConsole">Virtual Console</a> version also doesn't make the item work since the emulator doesn't support the rumble feature at all.

And its status as a C-equipped weapon makes it trickier to use than the B-equipped standard sword.
</li><li> The Fierce Deity's Mask. You can only use it against the five main bosses (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodBadBugs">though some glitches give the possibility of extending its use in the overworld</a>, and you can <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MundaneUtility">use it in the fishing holes in the 3DS remake</a>), and it doesn't have as many features as the usual transformation masks, so <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SwordBeam">shooting little energy discs from the sword</a> against the few enemies you can use it against gets old in a hurry. Also, because you must have gotten all the masks in the game to get it, you <em>already</em> had to beat all but the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBoss">Final Boss</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> The Bombchus in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOracleGames">The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages/Seasons</a></em> are only acquired as a bonus after starting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>, are not particularly useful at any point in the game, and cannot be restocked through drops from defeated enemies.
</li><li> The HD remake of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em> turns the Hero's Charm into this, since it's gotten there at the end of the Savage Labyrinth instead of Windfall Island. And the Labyrinth is where the Charm would be otherwise very useful to check the HP of the stronger enemies to know how much they have before they die.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>: Getting all the Poe Souls rewards you a Silver Rupee (200 rupees) every time you ask... but by then, Link has already beaten seven dungeons and the Cave of Ordeals to get those souls, filling up his wallet along the way. By comparison, the earlier reward of getting a bottle full of Great Fairy's Tears seems much better. It's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotCompletelyUseless">Not Completely Useless</a>, though, since Rupees also serve as fuel for your Magic Armor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em>: The Tunic of the Wild set, aka BotW's rendition of Link's classic green clothes. It's obtained by beating all 120 shrines in the game, at which point Link is completely overpowered. And even if he wasn't, this Tunic is <em>not</em> the best armor set of the game, stats-wise. That's still the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiskOneNuke">Champion's Tunic</a>, and there are other two armor sets that have the exact same defense stats as the Tunic of the Wild that are infinitely easier to find, namely the Hylian Armor and the Ancient Armor. You'll also probably have those armor sets fully upgraded at this point, and to get the Tunic of the Wild up to par with them you'll have to upgrade it as well, which requires tedious grinding to find dragon parts. The fact that a lot people find the clothes design <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WTHCostumingDepartment">bafflingly underwhelming</a> doesn't help either.
</li></ul></li><li> Downplayed with almost every <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Castlevania">Castlevania</a></em> game from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> group, which have an unlockable mode where you play as another character. While playing through the game again as another completely different character is fun, it still counts for the trope to some people as the unlockable characters can't do most of what the main character can (e.g. can't collect or use items, can't level up sometimes, and doesn't have a pause menu, even for changing controls or sound options).
<ul><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Old Axe Armor</span> in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin">Portrait of Ruin</a></em> is a solo character instead of a team of two, has only two special moves (one of which is used solely for navigation), and is simply a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> of an existing enemy. However, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokeCharacter">it is very likely this was intentional</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLegacyOfDarkness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaLegacyOfDarkness">Legacy of Darkness</a></em> rewards you with an admittedly cool scenario for beating the game once: you play as Henry, the child Cornell rescued and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthMentor">Stealth Mentored</a>, who has now <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FutureBadass">grown up to be quite badass</a> and out to save some captive children. Beat that mission, and you're rewarded with the option to play the original Castlevania 64. Whether or this is an example of this trope or a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope">subversion</a> hangs on how much you like that game.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetroidPrime3Corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></em> had some unlockables, such as bumper stickers and a Mii bobblehead for Samus's gunship, that were only made available by trading friend vouchers over the internet. The limited-edition <em>Trilogy</em> version of the game also had friend vouchers, but <em>Trilogy</em> vouchers could only be sent to other copies of <em>Trilogy</em>; you couldn't send vouchers to or from regular copies of <em>Corruption</em>. Subsequently, since the servers shut down in June 2013 due to the Wii's production life ending, it's now impossible for <em>anyone</em> to unlock the friend-voucher features if they haven't yet done so. Fortunately, some people have uploaded new save files that have all the vouchers.

It's impossible to get the best rank without playing the Hidden Mansion, for one thing, because the normal mansion doesn't have enough money. It also mirrors the entire game, ramps up the difficulty (ghosts deal more damage and there are fewer hearts), changes some of the puzzles a little, switches the money and gem locations all over the house, and retools some of the boss encounters, varying from mild variations in their attack pattern to an entirely different Boolossus fight, which has the whole floor covered in ice so that Luigi has to ride the Poltergust to "snowboard" across the arena.

The pro to this is that you don't have to worry about getting huge combos to keep your life and damage enemies, and you can just continually chuck shurikens at some hard to kill enemies. The downside is that there are some bosses that pretty much require you to get huge combos in order to defeat them in a timely fashion; however, you can also chuck shurikens at them continually. A perfect beginner character... only you don't get him until you've gotten 40 Oboro coins, which is only possible if you had already beaten the game once on Normal and again on Hard.

The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacingNitroFueled" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashTeamRacingNitroFueled">remake</a> rectifies this by scaling his kart down to roughly the same as everyone else's as well as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotedToPlayable">promoting him to playable</a>.

Your reward? A different menu screen. The latter unlocked tracks, ships and Phantom difficulty as rewards for winning in single race mode; the challenge, eliminator and championship modes were completely useless and unlocked nothing other than the next challenge, leaving you with nothing to show at the end. Bonus points because it wasn't explained anywhere how you were <em>actually</em> supposed to unlock content.

<ul><li> <em>II</em> had secret characters Berserker, Assassin, and Lizardman, unlockable only through special means in the Weapon Master Mode. The kicker is that they can't be used in most game modes (including Weapon Master itself), and their moveset lists are inaccessible from the start menu like every other character. Additionally, they only have one weapon each, but they all have six costumes when two or three is the standard. This is especially aggravating because to unlock Lizardman, you needed to beat every stage in Weapon Master Mode, including the ridiculously hard bonus stages, and the fact that he was a full-fledged character in the first <em>Soul Calibur</em> (alongside Hwang and Rock, whose movesets were adapted into Assassin's and Berserker's). This is slightly made up for due to the fact that Lizardman and Rock become full-fledged characters again in <em>Soul Calibur III</em> and <em>IV</em> (and <em>V</em> in Lizardman's case).
</li><li> Li Long from <em>Soul Blade</em> reappears in <em>Soul Calibur III</em>... as a bonus character using a moveset usually reserved for created characters. He's expanded in <em>Soul Calibur III Arcade Edition</em>, but fans still felt cheated. In a similar manner, Hwang and Amy also appear as bonus characters who use generic movesets. Whilst Li Long and Hwang went from being unique characters to being generic, Amy went from being generic to being a unique character of her own in <em>Soul Calibur IV</em>, meaning that this trope was reversed.

Beating all 8 levels simply rewards you with a differently suited version of Kazuya known as Devil Kazuya. Due to technical limitations, he really is just Kazuya in a purple suit, with none of the functionality of the Devil of later games (though the implication is that he is the same guy). Many players don't even bother. Many hadn't even seen him in action until Youtube came along. Interestingly, if you unlock Heihachi (who has to be unlocked by beating the game without losing), his matches will all be against Sub-Bosses, with the final boss being Devil Kazuya, but you don't unlock him this way. It's quite likely you were supposed to, but the game developers overlooked it.

<ul><li> There's a HUGE roster of officers to unlock, and while several of them have suspiciously similar movesets, each of them is, at least, a BIT original. However, the hardest character to unlock, by an order of magnitude, is Orochi Z - his appearance in your roster basically signifies that you have achieved 100% Completion and then some. You have to spend DAYS just grinding levels, well after you have finished completing every scenario on every difficulty, to unlock the last Dream Scenario - and then beat that to unlock Orochi Z.
</li><li> Orochi Z himself is the Final Boss, so that's awesome. He's not JUST a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">Palette Swap</a> of Orochi either, having different hair. However... firstly, he's doesn't have his own set of weapons, like everybody else does - he just uses the same set as Orochi. Second, his moveset is less than half the size of anybody else, and he never learns new moves - though, granted, those few moves he DOES have are pretty powerful. Finally, every other character has a series of artwork - various design-sketches, posed character-models, screenshots from cutscenes they're in and the like - that are unlocked as you use them. Orochi Z has none. So effectively, once you've taken him into combat ONCE to check out all 3 of his moves, there's literally no point in ever using him again - especially since, by that point, you've already done basically everything in the game.

But the game will treat him as a re-skin of Aragorn, since he will play literally every role Aragorn played in the levels, and even the dialogue and voice files will be the same. Particularly egregious is the fact that Isildur's version of the "Tower of Orthanc" <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusStage">Bonus Stage</a> has the same script as Aragorn's version, down to Saruman referring to him as a "ragtag Ranger".

However, Faramir was just a skin swap of Aragorn and all four Hobbits were essentially skin swaps of each other (with Pippin and Merry basically being clones of Sam). <br/><br/>Then when you finish all the levels in the game, you can play as any of the nine characters in all the levels, even where they weren't initially present. The problem? If they weren't originally meant for that level, the cutscenes won't even render them properly. The role the original character played in cutscenes will be taken by an invisible entity (though the original character's voice is still heard), while the player's character will just stand around somewhere in the background. <br/><br/>Also, the characters will <em>very</em> rarely have any specifically recorded dialogue for levels they weren't originally in (Gandalf's narrations not withstanding). Instead, the dialogue spoken by the character they replaced will be totally removed from gameplay, although lines of dialogue directly addressing the <em>original</em> character will still be used throughout the level. This can leave conversations completely one-sided, as well as confusing, in certain levels. <br/><br/>One notable moment is that both Éowyn <em>and</em> Merry have to be protected during the "Pelennor Fields" level, even when the player has selected Merry as their character.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestHeroes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestHeroes">Dragon Quest Heroes</a></em>, defeating Atlas will grant the player the Elevating Orb.

The problem is that not only is Atlas the single hardest fight in the game by a long shot (meaning most players will be at level 99 anyway), but the Orb also only increases defense by 1 point, worse than any other armor in the game, including generic armor that can be bought the instant one unlocks the armor shop near the start of the game.

Locking <em>Sonic 3</em> on <em>Sonic &amp; Knuckles</em> <em>still doesn't give Knuckles any abilities</em> despite the fact that he has extra powers in singleplayer. This is especially bad because Knuckles <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">actually has the proper chibi-sprites for gliding and climbing in Competition mode</a>, even in <em>Sonic 3</em> alone.

<ul><li> There are hidden keys in every level that, once you get them all, unlock a secret door for that level. While most of the doors have powerful weapons or enable shortcuts, the door in Lost Impact gives you an armored car... in a close-walled, cramped space station level. And you can't even take it very far, as there are walls you have to spin dash under, and rail segments where the car can't go, almost immediately after you get the prize. In fact, most of the unlockable weapons/secret doors are like this in Shadow. Particularly egregious are the secret doors for Westopolis (similar to Lost Impact, it gives you a bad-controlling lowrider with no special weapon which you get 75% of the way through the level) and Lethal Highway (a minigun with 80 ammo, which is pathetic if you were hoping for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreDakka">More Dakka</a> rampage). The worst is Mad Matrix, which just opens an alternate path to the Goal Ring. This is only remotely useful if you're trying to save some time to A-rank the neutral mission, and even then it's far from necessary.

However, he is identical to Sonic in every way, and can only be used in Trial Mode. What's worse is that he only flies at medium speed, switching back to running at maximum speed, so you don't even get that. He also gets his own emblems to collect, but nothing happens if you collect them all.
</li><li> In an odd example, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicAdvance">Sonic Advance</a> 2</em> let you unlock the Tiny Chao Garden by meeting certain conditions in the game... Even though the first <em>Sonic Advance</em> had the exact same mode available from the start. Amy being the final unlockable isn't impressive either. In the first <em>Advance</em>, her slow, non-rolling moveset greatly changed how you had to handle the game, but here she plays just like everyone else.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces">Sonic Forces</a></em> Red Star Rings give new bonus stages and put Number Rings in the stages. Whilst not bad, this is still disappointing considering in previous games red star rings gave you things like concept art and new music. Once you collect enough they unlock a new type of item to collect; Silver Moon Rings, which are a much straighter example considering all you get for collecting them all is an achievement.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a></em>
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX8">Mega Man X8</a></em>, the navigators Alia, Palette, and Layer are unlockable as playable characters. They are basically clones of X, Axl, and Zero, respectively; however, Alia cannot get X's capsule upgrades and Palette cannot copy enemies. You also have to purchase all of X, Axl, and Zero's purchasable upgrades a second time in order to access them on Alia, Palette, and Layer. Additionally, using even one of them when running a stage will forbid you from choosing a navigator for that stage.
</li><li> Vile's mode in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX">Mega Man X</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Maverick Hunter X</a></em> is one of the "can't do the whole game" variety. Although you get to go through the first couple of fortress levels after the eight bosses and beat Bospider and Rangda Bangda, at the end of the third fortress stage, you fight X and Zero instead. After beating them, you get the ending for Vile's alternate story, so there's no D-Rex to fight, and no battle with Velgauder or Sigma. On the plus side, afterwards you can go through the game again with unlimited power to select any weapons you want.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX3">Mega Man X3</a></em> is the first game in the series that allows you to play as Zero. However, you can only call on him once per stage, and he automatically switches back to X when he reaches a boss door (with one exception). So you can only play as him for 1/3 of any given level, and he can't be used for bosses or mini-bosses. Oh, and he has only one life, so if you die once using him, he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">lost forever</a>. And he doesn't get any special weapons or upgrades. You do need him to access a special upgrade for X late in the game though (even if it is a bit of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">Guide Dang It!</a>), and whether he's still alive or not at the end of the game affects the ending.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaManX4">Mega Man X4</a></em> is the first game to include cheat codes for extra content, one code for X and one for Zero. X's code gives him access to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Ultimate Armor</a>, which doubles his defense and gives him the air dash, hovering ability, unlimited ammo (except for charged attacks), a plasma shot and a spammable <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak">Giga Attack</a>. Zero's code gives him access to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperpoweredEvilSide">Black Armor</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PaletteSwap">which is black</a>... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin">and that's all</a>. At least it is fixed in later games, where it doubles his defense, raises his attack, makes him more agile and gives his saber the ability to destroy energy projectiles.
</li></ul></li><li> Proto Man is unlockable via DLC in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan9">Mega Man 9</a></em>. For the most part it was very well received, but there are three minor gripes: his mode has no story, and he cannot unlock achievements or access the item shop.
<ul><li> The higher difficulty levels, similarly, have achievements disabled.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MegaMan10">Mega Man 10</a></em>, however, fixed this by allowing achievements to be earned in different difficulty settings and giving Bass, the DLC character for the game, his own shop and story scenes.

This can only be used in a few specific areas of the game and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">in a bonus world after you beat the final boss</span> in her own mini-storyline.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarFoxAdventures">Star Fox Adventures</a></em> has Cheat Tokens which do a few things when you drop them into the well in the maze under the Warpstone. Whilst some of them are amusing and even helpful, most are underwhelming. Two of these stand out:
<ul><li> The Dino subtitle, which allows you to see the subtitles in Dino, the game's substitution cipher. However, it doesn't replace "[Dino Talk]" with what is actually said, and the subtitles are actually significantly <em>wrong</em> in spots. And it's not even included in the PAL version, so there's a Cheat Token that does absolutely nothing.
</li><li> Playing the game in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeliberatelyMonochrome">black and white</a>. Yes, the player can unlock an option to do what one can accomplish by adjusting one's TV set/monitor without the extra effort (unless they completely lack tech savvy beyond dealing with game consoles).

<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperMario64">Super Mario 64</a></em>: As a reward for completing the game 100%, the cannon outside the castle will unlock, giving you access to the castle's roof. Up there, you meet Yoshi, who will give you 100 lives if you talk to him. 100 lives that you have no use for, since you have completed the game. Made especially obvious by the lives being delivered by Yoshi, who you can't ride and who disappears right after. You also get a special triple jump, which replaces the standard third jump with a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSparkles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSparkles">sparkly</a> somersault that makes you invincible while flipping and protects you from fall damage. This is also pretty useless, as there are very few instances in the game where being invincible during a high jump would come in handy, you already have several ways of stopping fall damage, and the new triple jump can't be chained into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WallJump">Wall Jump</a>, making it a <em>down</em>grade from the default in some cases. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, Yoshi was originally planned to be part of a more elaborate event that was ultimately cut, but they didn't want the model to go to waste, so they added him to the end of the game as an afterthought.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Super Mario 64 DS</a></em> is <em>worse</em> than the original in this regard: Since Yoshi is playable in this version, no one appears on the roof, there's no upgraded Triple Jump to be unlocked, and worst of all, the only thing of interest on the roof is Luigi's final rabbit... which gives you a virtually unchanged version of another mini-game you're most likely to have unlocked by that point.

To access these levels, you need to scan them in with the appropriate Nintendo e-Reader cards, which required two Game Boy Advances, a Link Cable, an e-Reader, and a copy of the game in addition to the cards themselves, which is a lot of trouble and money to go through in it of itself. However, there is one big problem: the cards were released in packs as part of a set, with there being four series in all, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadExportForYou">only two series made it to America</a> while <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoExportForYou">Europe didn't get any</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DummiedOut">(with World e being out-right blocked off in that version)</a> due to the failure of the e-Reader outside of Japan, locking most players out of half or all of the bonus content. Not to mention that the cards themselves have become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrackIsCheaper">prohibitively expensive on the used market.</a> Thankfully, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WiiU">Wii U</a> Virtual Console re-release includes all of the levels by default in all regions, marking the first time half of the World e levels left Japan, and fan patches have since emerged for the original ROM that have patched in all of the World e levels.

It's not, it's just the game's intro scene, with purple coins added and all the characters present. The atmosphere is nice enough, but it's not really much of a level nor a decent true finale.

This by itself isn't a bad thing. What <em>is</em> bad, however, is that you lose the convenient warp pipe between Special 8 and World 8 (the Warp Pipes are the only way to switch between the normal and special worlds), as the Special 8-Crown replaces the pipe to World 8, and the pipe in World 8's map disappears. In other words, you are now forced to use a Warp Pipe in a different world in order to travel between World 8 and Special 8. A more logical solution would have been to give Special 8 an extension that houses Special 8-Crown, serving as a parallel to World 8 map extension featuring World 8-6 and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVeryDefinitelyFinalDungeon">The Very Definitely Final Dungeon</a>.

In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysAdventure">Kirby's Adventure</a></em> and its remake, all it does is make things harder by cutting your life meter in half. Thankfully, the remake makes up for this by introducing a new mode where you can play as Meta Knight, and the extra modes in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KirbysReturnToDreamLand">Kirby's Return to Dream Land</a></em> and later games have further unique content (including tougher bosses).

The problem? First, despite being available in Challenge Mode, its damage output is still set to Normal Mode levels, so it's woefully ineffective against even the weakest of Challenge Mode enemies. Second, it was cut for a reason: the enemy detection, fire rate and the time it lasts is not conveyed at all, so you're never really sure whether its ended or just taking a long time between shocks. Third, the Clank Shocker (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">which takes a while to level up to</a>), adds laser eyes, which are just as weak and only fire behind Ratchet. And fourth, it cost 2 million bolts to buy. Eventually that becomes chump change, but if you first start Challenge Mode and buy it, you just wasted money you could have spent on an effective Mega Weapon instead.

</li><li> In the GBC <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameRemake">Video Game Remake</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestIII">Dragon Quest III</a></em>, <em>every</em> monster in the game <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomlyDrops">Randomly Drops</a> Bronze, Silver, and Gold Medals. Get enough of them, and you can go to Divine Dragon's Castle and gain wishes. Get more, and and you unlock the ultimate <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeon</a> with the Grand Dragon of Everything. Get <em>every medal in the game</em> and the Grand Dragon...falls asleep. You also get the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfinityPlusOneSword">Rubiss Sword</a> if you beat him in a time limit, which is the strongest sword in the game and casts the strongest spell in the game if used as an item.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestVIII">Dragon Quest VIII</a></em>, you can get the Gospel Ring, an accessory that prevents <em>all</em> random encounters, as a reward for completely filling out the monster list. The problem with that? You have to beat all 8 forms of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a> in a row to get their entries on the list. By the time you're tough enough to do that, you don't need the ring at all; not only will any random encounter cease to be any sort of challenge, but the other methods of reducing encounters, Holy Water or the hero's Holy Protection spell, will also prevent all encounters while they last, for the low cost of a very cheap item or a couple MP.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI">Final Fantasy VI</a></em>, defeating optional boss Kaiser Dragon in the Advance release rewards you with the Diabolos Magicite. Its summon and the spells it teaches are all bound by the damage limit, so he'll never do more than 9999 damage, a limit you're already pushing against if you're strong enough to beat Kaiser in the first place. The only use Diabolos has is his level up bonus "HP+ 100%", meaning your HP increases twice as much when you level up, which is good, but other Espers give "HP+ 50%", so ultimately Diabolos does nothing you can't already do with the other Magicite pieces.
<ul><li> Averted with the other three optional Magicite shards - Leviathan teaches Flood, which is a water-elemental spell, so you can exploit that elemental weakness in enemies more easily (prior to the Advance release, there were no water-elemental spells at all except for Strago's Aqua Rake and Clean Sweep), Cactuar gives a speed boost on level up and is one of only two Espers to do so (and the other one doesn't give as good a boost anyway <em>and</em> can be given away and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable</a>), and Gilgamesh teaches the Quick spell, letting you teach it to two characters at once — definitely a boon since it only has a learn rate of 1% and thus takes forever to learn. And <em>those</em> three are obtainable much earlier on, if you know where to look.
</li><li> A larger HP increase means that low level runs let you get even better stats than usual, and Gravija is unique in that it cannot be resisted even by bosses, making it an eminently spammable all-target 9999 damage nuke.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII">Final Fantasy VII</a></em>, defeated Ruby Weapon gave you a gold chocobo. However, it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NintendoHard">Nintendo Hard</a> to defeat it <em>without</em> breeding one in the first place, and this new gold chocobo sucks at races. Averted with Emerald Weapon, where the reward is a set of "Master" Materia. The only other way to get them is to master <em>every</em> Materia of each type, which will take hours upon hours of training.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonBlack2AndWhite2">Pokémon Black 2 and White 2</a></em> is infamous for this trope, particularly after the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS">Nintendo DS</a>' Wi-Fi service was shut down in 2014. While the games boast a <em>very</em> impressive repertoire of bonus features, many of them rely heavily on said WFC or inter-game communication, making them much more difficult to access and much less functional years after the games came out. A particularly notorious example is how the games' difficulty modes are tied to the Key System; Challenge Mode, a much-coveted and -desired feature in a Pokémon game, is finally available, but can only be accessed in <em>Black 2</em> after beating the main storyline (i.e. long after it's actually needed), and can only be <em>applied</em> to either of the two games by communicating with another game that has Challenge Mode unlocked.
</li><li> The main reason most people don't ever bother to completely finish the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeons</a> in any of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ValkyrieProfile">Valkyrie Profile</a></em> games: your reward for doing so is a weapon with a huge attack stat, but the catch is that not only is it obtained at a point you can most likely already kill everything else easily, but it can also inflict random damage, with it rarely being able to do as much damage as its attack stat would suggest.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a></em> had a similar scenario with the pre-order bonus/<em>Courier's Stash</em> DLC items. Most of them were lackluster to begin with, but were made worse by lack of compatibility with Perks and other DLC. The way the game's engine is written, any given DLC cannot directly act on another — the end result was that most of the pre-order equipment was counter-intuitively excluded from Perks added by main DLC. For example, the pre-order shotgun is the <em>only shotgun in the game</em> that doesn't benefit from the <em>And Stay Back</em> (10% chance to knock enemies over when they are hit with a shotgun) Perk added in <em>Dead Money</em>. Some of the weapons would accept mods, albeit with glitchy results. The only truly unique item was the Vault 13 canteen, an item that would automatically drop the player's dehydration level in Hardcore Mode, but not enough to subsist upon it alone. In Normal mode, it provided a slight automatic healing effect every time you sipped from it (once every few minutes), making it useful only for saving healing items when outside of combat if you were fast-traveling or had some time to kill in a safe area where you didn't have to worry about an attack, and given how many stimpaks you'd be carrying by the midpoint of the game, that wasn't terribly useful either.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhiteKnightChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WhiteKnightChronicles">White Knight Chronicles</a> II</em> made a pretty big deal out of the fact that one of its features was that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAdventurerIsYou">your avatar character</a> would gain the ability to transform into a (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignItYourselfEquipment">fully customizable</a>!) Knight like the other main characters could. But when do you unlock the Arc Knight? Right before heading off for the final dungeon. Oh, and you need to complete an easily-missable sidequest to unlock it. And that whole "fully customizable" part? You need to spend <em>months</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelGrinding">Level Grinding</a> your Guild Rank and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemFarming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItemFarming">Item Farming</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">the right amounts of the right arbitrary items in order to make and equip the parts that change the Knight's appearance</a>. It got so ridiculous that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Level5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Level5">Level-5</a> went and released DLC that replicated all the Knight parts and billed them as being "cheaper" to manufacture than their in-game counterparts... <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YankTheDogsChain">but not by much</a>.

This allows you to experiment with more diverse party combinations... a feature that might mean something if your party wasn't already strong enough to take down the bosses in the first half of the game in a round of basic attacks.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Recettear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Recettear">Recettear</a></em> lets you unlock <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Arma</a> as a playable adventurer after completing Lapis Ruins, the first postgame dungeon. As a boss, she's extremely fast-paced and vicious, uses nearly her entire arsenal of weapons, and most of them will demolish you in just a few hits. As a player character, she starts at level 1, moves very slowly, has no useful specials (the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaveMotionGun">Wave-Motion Gun</a> eats your entire SP bar and you'll usually take more damage charging it than if you just attacked normally), her weapons are all prohibitively unwieldy and/or do anemic damage — generally both — even after leveling up to par with everyone else, and very slow recovery after firing any of them leaves her wide open to counterattack. Even the Omega Cannon, her ultimate fused weapon, fires at such an awkwardly high and slow (backward!) arc and has such a pitifully short homing radius that it's more likely to hit empty space behind your targets when the shots bother curving forward toward them at all. By the time you unlock her, literally any other character in the game save maybe Elan will be able to tackle long dungeons and thick bosses alike much more easily and safely.

<ul><li> The other three <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusDungeon">Bonus Dungeons</a>, the Dimensional Vortexes, are not much better.

<ul><li> For maxing out all Social Links in a single playthrough you get the Mandara Robe armour. Which has pathetic defense but boosts Exp gain by 50%. There's several issues with this. First is by the time you max all the Social Links, you only have the final dungeon left to complete, so you probably won't need to grind anymore. Second is it's protagonist-exclusive, and due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantDropTheHero">Can't Drop the Hero</a> it's likely the protagonist is overlevelled already. Third, it's outclassed by the Haikara Shirt, which not only has the same effect, better defence and can be equipped by anyone, but is also <em>far easier to obtain</em>. By contrast, completing all Social Links in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3">Persona 3</a></em> unlocked a unique Persona for fusion.

However, this works by essentially locking your shottype to focused or unfocused. Human characters still can't shoot through familiars, making stages much worse, and youkai characters can't shoot familiars, causing problems with a number of bosses. In addition to this, Remilia's options have a bit of lag when you try to move them when she's solo, and you can't focus to center Youmu's ghost half anymore. Just to make things worse, most solo characters are missing a large portion of their phantom gauge, making them difficult to score with. Except Youmu, whose shortened gauge makes her the best character to score with, even if she's awkward to use.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Gradius">Gradius V</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Ikaruga">Ikaruga</a></em> have continues that increase for each hour of play, culminating in "free play" (unlimited continues) after a set number of continues obtained. But if you improve yourself at either game, by the time you unlock free play, you most likely won't need it anymore. <em>Gradius Gaiden</em> is a similar case, save for the increasing credits; you start with 9 instead of 3, and they never go up save for when you unlock free play.
</li><li> A variant of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KonamiCode">Konami Code</a> can be used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Contra">Contra</a>: Shattered Soldier</em> that grants the player 30 lives for their first credit. However, <em>Shattered Soldier</em> features a grading system that evaluates the player's performance at the end of each stage, deducting a percentage of their hit rate based on the number of lives lost. This means that player must lose as few lives as possible (preferably none at all) to achieve a perfect grade. Getting an overall grade below "A" gives the player a bad ending. The Konami Code simply makes it easier to get the bad ending.

<ul><li> One of the most hyped features of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionPackSequel">VR Missions</a></em> was the fact that players could finally control Solid Snake's old war buddy Gray Fox, aka the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NinjaPirateZombieRobot">Cyborg Ninja</a>. This feature was so much of a selling point that Gray Fox's face is not only used on the packaging illustration, but also on the actual title screen itself. Despite all the effort required to unlock him (which is even more complicated in the Japanese <em>Integral</em> version, since it required the player to complete the main game and trade data using the PocketStation memory card), he only has three missions out of the 300 actually featured in the game (that's literally 1% of the game) and they're <em>all</em> set in the same stage with only slightly different objectives between each: the first mission involves destroying a set number of stationary dummy targets, the second mission involves killing a set number of Genome Soldiers, and the final mission involves assassinating Solid Snake, who appears as a head-swapped Genome Soldier patrolling the area.
</li><li> Some of the unlockable bonus camouflage from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a></em> wouldn't be worth picking up for free, let alone actually going to the effort to obtain:
<ul><li> Both The Pain and The Fury's camouflage. The former's makes bees follow you harmlessly and attack guards instead, and the latter reduces explosion damage and grants immunity to catching flame. The problem isn't that neither of these abilities are so esoteric you'll never bother to use them (why attack with bees when you have <em>guns</em> and there are few opportunities to benefit from the fire resistances), but that they tend to give poor camouflage indexes, often <em>negative</em> values, which will greatly hinder you. Ironically The Fury's camo is actually quite useful against The Fury himself, but that means you'll still have to beat him once without it and carry it over into a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a>.
</li><li> The <em>Nine National Facepaints</em>, rewarded to the player for getting all 27 ranks in <em>Snake Eater 3D</em>. Not only do they all grant poor camouflage indexes, but they grant absolutely no abilities whatsoever. Compared to the much easier to acquire green and brown facepaints that grant unlimited grip or oxygen (respectively), such a difficult to acquire prize being only a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosmeticAward">Cosmetic Award</a> is a fantastic fail.

<ul><li> The Samurai Edge handgun from the 2002 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil1">Resident Evil</a></em> remake. It fires three rounds at a time in quick succession and has infinite ammo, but it's only marginally more powerful than the default handgun and its probability of blowing off zombie heads isn't much higher, either. It's certainly useful early in the game, but it'll get tossed in the item box at the exact same time the regular handgun normally is since your shotgun, magnum and grenade launchers still outclass it by a mile.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvilCodeVeronica">Resident Evil Code: Veronica</a></em> lets you play as Albert Wesker in the Battle Game. You remember, the same guy who runs across <em>walls</em> in bullet time and bitch slaps Claire Redfield effortlessly? Yeah, in Battle Game he can't do any of that and gets only a knife to play with. While it carries on the usual thing of villains having tougher inventory sets to play with in minigames, it's still a bitter pill to swallow. You can get a Colt Python with which to fight Alexia. However, not only does it <em>not</em> have infinite ammo like everyone else's guns, but whether you get it or not <em>depends on luck.</em>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil4">Resident Evil 4</a></em> is big on this trope:
<ul><li> There's the Hand Cannon, a souped-up Magnum with massive stopping power and the ability to go through multiple enemies per shot. You get it by getting maximum rankings with every character in <em>RE4</em>'s Mercenaries mode, which can be remarkably hard for certain characters... But by this point, chances are you've already beaten the game once and probably bought the Chicago Typewriter, Infinite Rocket Launcher, or even just fully upgraded another regular Magnum, which makes the Hand Cannon look pretty pointless in comparison.
</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PlayStation2">PlayStation 2</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a> versions introduce the PRL-412, a futuristic anti-Plagas weapon that is only obtained after beating Professional (hard) Mode, which means there isn't much of any reason to use it, since the player's probably finished everything by then anyway. It's not even particularly great, being a slow charging laser that serves mostly as an unlimited supply of flash grenades unless you spend the time charging it to full power, in which case it kills Plagas villagers instantly, but not much else. Even worse, a weak flash can kill the final boss immediately.
</li><li> Because using the Raccoon Police Department/"pop starlet" outfits for Leon and Ashley is also supposed to enable Ada's "Assignment Ada" tactical outfit during the main game (who only appears during cutscenes in the main game), the original PC version and the PS2 version miss out on seeing this because of their use of pre-rendered cutscenes (which were only derived from a playthrough with the normal outfits and no secondary versions of these scenes were ever recorded for an alternate outfit playthrough). However, the original GameCube version of the game and all releases after the original PC port use in-engine cutscenes, meaning characters stay dressed however they appear during gameplay and thus Ada will show up wearing her tactical gear during cutscenes.
</li></ul></li><li> Finishing <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> unlocks the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewGamePlus">New Game+</a> where you play the exact same campaign over again, except as Sheva instead of Chris. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Um... yay.</a> It boils down to getting to do about six or seven slightly different things in the otherwise identical campaign, making it look monumentally lame when compared to Separate Ways of the previous game or even the Game B modes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil2">Resident Evil 2</a></em>. Even that wouldn't be so bad if they didn't foist an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterfaceScrew">Interface Screw</a> on you: Sheva's entire screen is mirrored, which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamnYouMuscleMemory">takes a lot of getting used to</a> and which most people won't bother doing for the sole purpose of playing as Sheva. The following game learned their lesson from this one, letting you toggle the screen at will and choose which of the two characters you want to play as right at the start, and rewarding you with an entire fourth campaign starring <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnsembleDarkHorse">Ada Wong</a> for beating the game.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil6">Resident Evil 6</a></em> has the unlimited ammo unlockable, but someone along the way on development apparently forgot such a thing is <em>supposed</em> to give the player an unfair imbalanced advantage for the sake of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool">cool</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfAwesome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfAwesome">fun</a>, and so it was monumentally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nerf">Nerfed</a>. You have to unlock unlimited ammo for each weapon <em>type</em> (handguns, rifles, shotguns, etc) individually, and each one takes a monumental amount of grinding before it becomes available (1,500 enemies with the handgun, and that's the <em>smallest</em> amount), <em>then</em> you need to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleUnlock">pay an absurd amount of skill points</a> to purchase it (80,000 for the handgun, again the smallest), and <strong>then</strong> need to equip it to one of three available skill slots to use it (meaning that, at the cost of no other skills, you can only have three at a time). Compared to <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil5">Resident Evil 5</a></em> and its "here's your unlimited ammo for <em>everything</em> have fun" feature, it comes as a monumental letdown, and most players can't be arsed to unlock more than one.

For example, "Civilian Anya" is the same character as "Anya Stroud," albeit minus her armor and with a different hairstyle. Anya's basic form is available by default—"Civilian Anya" isn't unlocked until level 45.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder16');">    Turn-Based Strategy </div><div class="folder" id="folder16" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTacticsAdvance">Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</a></em> is a two-in-one combo. It has several unlockable characters; some of these are unique characters that cannot change classes or learn new abilities, while others are merely normal units with special sprites. One, notoriously, doesn't unlock until after you have nothing you can possibly do with him. Some of the special characters can't even enter the water, all because they don't have sprites drawn of them being in the water. Feather Boots can fix this since it makes the wearer walk on the water rather than in it.
<ul><li> Especially bad with Ezel Berbier, who is locked into a class with high magic attack growth and low physical attack growth, and has no ability to learn any skills that use his magic attack stat.
</li></ul></li><li> The original <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyTactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a></em> has the Byblos. He joins you as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuestStarPartyMember">Guest-Star Party Member</a> when you fight the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BonusBoss">Bonus Boss</a>, and if he survives, he joins your team afterward. Is he any good? Well... he's a monster unit, which means he can't use equipment or change classes. He's nowhere near as strong as the other special monster unit you get, Worker 8, and doesn't have Worker 8's innate magic immunity. His skills are thoroughly mediocre, and (being a monster unit) he'll never learn more. The best thing you can really say about him is that he has innate Poach, but teaching that to human units is easy. Waste of a character, to be honest.
<ul><li> Bonus character Cloud Strife can also fall into this category. You get him at the end of a fairly long sidequest...and he's level 1. In addition, to use his unique abilities, you need his special weapon, which is only obtained by having someone with Move-Find Item step on a particular tile in a particular place (though at least, unlike all other Move-Find Item spaces, there's only one possible item to get), and is only so-so in strength. Even worse, his skills target <em>panels</em> instead of characters, meaning that unless you go out of your way to prevent it, his target will likely end up moving out of harm's way before it goes off. If you have the patience to get his sword and level him up though, he's a decent party member, and doing the sidequest also nets you several other party members and good rewards, so it's not really a waste.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheSacredStones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</a></em>, you can earn several special party members by going through the two bonus dungeons, the Tower of Valni and the Lagdou Ruins. These characters are all characters who existed in the main story as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonPlayerCharacter">Non-Player Characters</a>, some of whom were even bosses. Sounds cool, right? Unfortunately, you can only unlock these characters after playing through the entire main campaign, meaning all you really can use them in are the dungeons in which they are unlocked and random battles on the world map. Worse still, the vast majority of them are some of the worst units in the game, due to coming with high levels, poor base stats, terrible growth rates, and being unable to support other units; even the best among them are easily outmatched by units you recruited in the main campaign. The only ones with any useful equipment or skills are Ismaire (who comes with a unique weapon), Valter (who has an exceptionally rare item), Caellach (likewise) and Lyon (who has a unique class capable of summoning phantoms, as well as a unique infinite-durability tome and a rare staff); the others come with various generic weapons and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VendorTrash">Vendor Trash</a>. Even for completionists, recruiting Lyon may be more trouble than it's worth, because getting him requires you to fight through the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Lagdou Ruins</a> <em>three times</em>. Just to rub salt in the wound, they are, for whatever reason, unable to be used against other players in the Link Arena.
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemPathOfRadiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a></em> is similar, featuring enemy characters that can be played post-campaign. Unlike <em>Sacred Stones</em> though, there is no post-campaign, so instead you can only play with them in six bland "trial" chapters (three of which require an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldSaveBonus">Old Save Bonus</a>, and are just copies of levels found in the main game), which have no story or named enemies in them. Also, it requires a downright silly number of playthroughs to unlock them; you don't get the first until finishing the lengthy game three times, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> requires <em>fifteen</em> full passes of the game to unlock. It doesn't help that most of them, barring the last one recruited, are rather lackluster and only worth looking at due to their rare equipment.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBindingBlade">Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade</a></em>, like <em>Path of Radiance</em>, also has characters unlockable for use in a series of dull trial maps (though <em>Binding Blade</em> only has <em>five</em> unless you were lucky enough to win more in promotional events), and has similarly silly requirements for unlocking them (the last one, Guinevere, requires a full nine passes through the game to unlock). To make it worse, most of them are markedly inferior to your normal units anyway; in particular, the first one recruited, Narshen, is too weak to survive much of anything in the trial maps. Only Guinevere is really notable, and then, mostly because of her unique gimmick of having access to both Light magic and Anima magic at the same time.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening">Fire Emblem Awakening</a></em> continues the trend with its six Spotpass characters, available as free DLC and recruited in six special downloaded chapters. Unlike previous examples, most of them range from decent but underleveled to surprisingly powerful, and two even have completely unique skills that no one else naturally has access to. However, they're only able to be recruited right before the final chapter, and some of their recruitment chapters are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatOneLevel">harder than the final chapter itself</a>. Worse still, their support pool is extremely limited, as all six of them can <em>only</em> support the Avatar; in a game where two units achieving an S-Support can make them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreaker">obscenely powerful when paired up</a>, this is a harsh drawback. While the existence of other DLC chapters prevents them from becoming truly useless like previous examples in the series, the final one, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalBonusLevel">Apotheosis</a>, basically requires an army consisting of nothing but S-ranked units paired together with maximum stats and the absolute best skills available, meaning at most exactly <em>one</em> of them will get a chance to participate. They're not as bad as previous examples, but are still generally underwhelming all the same.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemThreeHouses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a></em> featured the recurring shopkeeper Anna as part of the game's paid DLC season pass. While Anna does get her own paralogue, she doesn't have any support conversations, not even with the player character. This is a sharp contrast to the game's other DLC characters, who all have multiple supports. In particular, Jeritza was released at the same time as a free update for all players, and he has multiple supports and paired endings.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NintendoWars">AdvanceWars</a></em>, unlocking every single other CO in the game, an act which requires beating the game multiple times while meeting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt">extremely specific criteria</a>, lets you purchase <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> Sturm to play with. Unfortunately it's not the +30 Attack/Defense Sturm whose CO power lays waste to his enemy's forces you face in the final battle, but a watered down -20 attack +30 defense version with an inferior CO power that is more likely to fall on <em>your own forces</em>. Quite literally <em>every single other character in the game is more useful than him</em>, as using him with any level of effectiveness requires a specific and difficult-to-master defensive style of gameplay. At least the developers learned their lesson in the sequels, where not only are the secret characters much more straightforward to acquire, but the unlocked Sturm, Von Bolt, and Caulder are every bit as deadly as their final boss counterparts and will break the game beyond all belief.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChampionsOnline">Champions Online</a></em> there are three crafting schools, Weapons, Mysticism, and Science. Each of these used to have a single SPECIAL BONUS "crafted travel power" the player could claim/build. For instance, in Weapons the travel power was called the "R.A.D. Sphere." It required leveling your character's crafting ability up to the 300-400 range, buying the blueprints, crafting a few dozen items, which were each in turn crafted from a dozen other items apiece which you ALSO had to buy the blueprints for, then gathering another dozen or so increasingly rare dropped artifacts, then assembling them all together...with another blueprint. The result for all this running back and forth to the crafting table, spending a fortune in points, and scouring the countryside pummeling various monsters to get them to drop rare items? Your character got the power to crouch down, wrap his arms around his knees, and roll forward. At about running pace. It looks stupid, is ridiculously slow, and if you should actually wish to level this power up, you had to go through the above hunt-and-gather grinding rigamarole all over again to BUILD the next iteration. <br/>The Mysticism and Science crafted travel powers were actually worse, being nothing more than bog-standard flight power with, respectively, some purple glowy dots and some electrical sparks tacked on. And with the April 2012 complete overhaul, these are now purchaseable outright with in-game resources, at which point they become available as normal powers to any toon you have. The epic grind for them no longer exists.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Mabinogi">Mabinogi</a></em> had an event that makes you play Bingo using a Roulette from an NPC who says he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies">always lucky</a>. The Main reward for completing the Bingo board is a unique Bag that gives you more inventory spaces. Unfortunately, the Bag requires a Premium service in order to open, and as <em>Mabinogi</em> being made a Free MMO, this reward will go unused and will be gone by the time the event is over. Said NPC lost his lucky status after reappearing in another event. They've given out similar bags as a reward during their spring 2013 Vocaloid event. Same issue, although for people who <em>do</em> subscribe the bags are an improvement over what's normally available, and they're entirely up front in the description of the event what the limitation on the bags is. In general, the combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingFades">Everything Fades</a> (though bags actually don't), continual introduction of new things to the game which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermanentlyMissableContent">Permanently Missable Content</a> applies to, and limited storage space for players can easily lead to feelings of this.

The caveat? Due to the way the signal is processed, you need a proprietary component cable to actually get 480p video. Said cables were produced in <em>very</em> small quantities, were bought by a <em>very</em> small number of GameCube owners, and were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfThree">very</a></em> quickly discontinued. For a while, the cables were <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyLongGag">very</a></em> expensive (topping off at $300 on eBay), though cheaper third-party cables have eventually entered the market. However, even if you do have the component cables, it occupies a special "Digital A/V Out" port on the console, which was removed in a 2004 console revision due to the low sales of the component cable. You're almost better off getting a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Wii">Wii</a>, which can not only play GameCube games in 480p (or at least the earlier models can), but is overall cheaper, with the component cables not being as rare and expensive.
