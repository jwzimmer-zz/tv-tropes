</p><p><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> alcoholics are not always lying in the gutter  sometimes they are just people who drink alone, or for the sake of drinking, but never appearing to drink to excess (due to tolerance). Commonly, alcohol is drunk due to its effects as an anti-anxiety drug. It is entirely possible that successful people may be alcoholics on the inside. The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-functioning_alcoholic">High-Functioning Alcoholic<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is proof that sometimes you cannot tell an alcoholic by mere appearance, and they may be in fact be in lofty professions such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilLawyerJoke">law</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SleazyPolitician">politics</a> (both highly associated with alcoholism; there are even specialized help lines and recovery networks for lawyers and judges needing help with alcohol and drug use). Hollywood, however, prefers the "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter">Straw Boozer</a>" form: someone wandering the streets in a stupor with a bottle in their hand is more obvious and pathetic than a high-functioning alcoholic who usually stays in their room with a glass in hand contemplating.

</p><p>There is no known cure for alcoholism. Someone who has managed to quit the habit is considered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoveredAddict" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecoveredAddict">recovering alcoholic</a>, and if committed to it, remains in whatever therapy he or she used to become sober. That said, there are people who quit without therapy, or who stay sober without therapy, as well as some (very) rare people who don't become sober but do become moderate and responsible drinkers (and their mere <em>existence</em> is controversial to the point of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlameWar">Flame Wars</a> over whether they are "in denial" or if it really is possible to drink responsibly once having become addicted).
</p><p>Note that making a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife">Real Life</a> actual alcoholic (as in a physically addicted to alcohol one, not just an emotionally addicted one or ordinary irresponsible drinker) go cold turkey is <em>putting their life at risk,</em> as alcohol withdrawal can lead to <em>delirium tremens,</em> which, if untreated, results in death. Physically addicted alcoholics <em>must</em> be tapered off of alcohol, slowly reducing the amount they drink, or weaned from it in a proper hospital setting where if they begin to go into delirium tremens, it can be treated.

But thanks to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLiveItDown">Never Live It Down</a>, this is the default portrayal of him in other media. In <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan1">the movie</a>, nearly every scene that's not a fight scene has him drinking an alcoholic beverage of some sort. As <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2">the sequel</a> was partially an adaptation of the storyline <em>dealing</em> with the drinking problem, it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Foreshadowing">Foreshadowing</a>.

In fact, it's really quite essential... I mean, who in their right mind's going to climb into it sober?
</div></li><li> Of course, there's a secondary reason for Ultimate Stark's alcoholism: he has an inoperable brain tumor that will kill him in under five years, which means he must be dealing with some massive migraines. Ultimate Stark also has brain tissue all over his body that makes him more intelligent but also causes him to feel constant agony. Wearing a special bio-suit and being plastered 24-7 helps him to cope with it.

The portrayal is horrifying in his first appearance — <em>The Crab with the Golden Claws</em>, where he's arguably more dangerous to Tintin than the baddies they're fighting. Although often the subject of jokes, readers are left in no doubt that it's an addiction and has terrible side effects not only on Haddock himself but everyone around him. It's also a running gag that he is so addicted to alcohol, he's incapable of drinking non-alcoholic drinks, especially water. Fortunately, his addiction slowly weakens during the course of the series thanks to a combination of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, horrible repercussions, and Tintin's efforts to keep him away from alcohol.

<ul><li> Robert Baratheon has fallen deep into alcoholism and is often seen with a drink in hand, which eventually leads to his death. In one memorable scene, he discusses the state of the Seven Kingdoms with Cersei, saying that every powerful man in Westeros has a different agenda. When Cersei asks him what he wants, Robert simply holds up his goblet of wine.
</li><li> Like her late husband, Cersei shows an increasing fondness for wine throughout the series as there are an increasing number of scenes where she has a cup close to hand, and she notably gets quite drunk during the Battle of Blackwater. In the books, this trait is because as Queen Regent she increasingly turns to drink while crumbling under the pressure of ruling seven kingdoms and politicking the great and good of the royal court to keep her children safe. Jaime mentions it in "Two Swords" and Margaery uses it as a barb in their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolitenessJudo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PolitenessJudo">Politeness Judo</a> in "High Sparrow".

Varys <em>tries</em> to keep him functional, as the first thing Tyrion does when he gets out of the crate in which he crossed over to Essos is grab a bottle of wine and drink until he pukes. Daenerys quickly picks up on it and criticizes him and starts restricting his drinking, but in Season 6 there are literally only a couple of scenes in which he appears <em>without</em> a glass or decanter of wine nearby. Between Cersei and Tyrion, it seems like a safe bet that the Lannisters are genetically predisposed to alcoholism. In the books, other Lannisters from (relatively recent) Westerosi history would also stand as evidence of this genetic predisposition, such as Lord Tytos Lannister, Tywin and Kevin's father. This may go a long way in explaining why Tywin has such a grudge against it. By the time he returns to Westeros, though, he largely seemed to have kicked the habit or reduced it dramatically.

However, during Season 8, John Jr. dies under mysterious circumstances, and while Mr. Edwards is deeply in grief, when he learns the truth about his eldest son's death  he was killed by a corrupt businessman whom newspaper reporter John Jr. was about to expose as a crook — he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheWagon">falls off the wagon</a>, destroying his family and business in the process... and it nearly also destroys his bond with the Ingalls.
