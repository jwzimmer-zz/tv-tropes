Every person has roots!
</p><p>This past can become a large burden on the character: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater">They need an excuse to leave their family behind, or need to constantly visit their parents and other family members in between adventures</a>. Otherwise the hero can't believably be a <em>social</em>, likable good guy.
</p><p>Orphaned heroes, on the other hand, never have to deal with all that. They don't need an excuse to go on wild adventures or stay away for days on end, they don't have anyone waiting around for them to come home! Conveniently, these heroes can answer the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure">Call to Adventure</a> because they don't have other responsibilities.
</p><p>Often used as character backgrounds in tabletop adventures: Such a character's background often consists of "My parents were killed by (insert <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysChaoticEvil">Always Chaotic Evil</a> race here), so I'm out for revenge". Aside from conveniently leaving no 'annoying' ties to the past to keep the character away from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallToAdventure">Call to Adventure</a>, it can also result in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather">You Killed My Father</a> moment should the villain race (or the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> if he's responsible) appear.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Handily prevents the sadistic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMaster">Game Master</a> from exploiting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad">'weak links'</a> that can get <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DamselInDistress">kidnapped</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerPunch">killed off</a>. If the fates of the missing parents are left nebulous, it also opens the door for that infamous twist where one of them turns out to be a villain. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LukeIAmYourFather">You know the one</a>.
</p><p>Oddly enough, family outside of parents is never mentioned. Apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfNoGrandparents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldOfNoGrandparents">no one ever has grandparents</a> or cousins, although <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nephewism">having an uncle (and sometimes aunt) as surrogate parents</a> is common. Siblings (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyChildSyndrome">if they exist at all</a>) seem to only show up for plot-based reasons â€” and not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PromotionToParent">Promotion to Parent</a>, which would give them responsibilities. One wonders how the world manages to get populated when every couple only has one child.

This part of the Hero's backstory is often covered in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashBack">Flash Back</a>. If the orphaning happens at the very beginning of the story, instead of in the background, it's usually covered by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">Doomed Hometown</a>.
</p><p>If the character does have parents, but they have so little influence on their life that they behave as if they have no family responsibilities anyway, <em>or it just isn't talked about period,</em> it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a>.
</p><p>May lead to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TellMeAboutMyFather" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TellMeAboutMyFather">Tell Me About My Father</a>.
</p><p>Contrast with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal">Orphan's Ordeal</a>, where the loss of parents <em>is</em> the plot (or at least a subplot), rather than simply enabling the plot.
</p><p>If the parents happened to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodParents">Good Parents</a> before their death, so much so that they continue to affect the main character even after they're dead, then you've got <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedParentsAreTheBest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeceasedParentsAreTheBest">Deceased Parents Are the Best</a>.
</p><p>Not to be confused with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">Self-Made Orphan</a>.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CuteyHoney">Cutey Honey</a></em>: Honey Kisaragi lost her father early on the series. His death triggered her war against the terrorist group named Panther Claw.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daimos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Daimos">Daimos</a></em>: Kazuya lost her parents before the start of the series. Erika's father died shortly before Kazuya's father, and THAT is what starts off the history.

</li></ul><ul><li> Applies to most of the main characters in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em>:
<ul><li> Rosette and Joshua's parents died in a ship wreck when they were young children, and after that they spent most of their life in an orphanageâ€”until Joshua is taken by Aion (and the orphanage is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown">destroyed in the process</a>), which causes Rosette to join the Order to try to find her brother again.
</li><li> Azmaria's parents either abandoned her because of her powers, or were killed during the war, depending on which version you're following.
</li><li> Satella's parents were killed by a demon when she was a child. Her sister was also kidnapped by the demonâ€”leading her on a journey similar to Rosette's. However, since her parents' deaths <em>are</em> such a turning point for Satella in her backstory, she leans closer to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrphansOrdeal">Orphan's Ordeal</a> instead.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em>, none of the main characters have living parents or relatives: Tanjiro and Nezuko's family was slaughtered early on, and Inosuke's mother was slain when he was an infant, and not much was known about Zenitsu's parents as he spent his entire life alone mooching off other people before he met his master. This does grant them the freedom to go out and slay demons.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em>:

</li><li> Winry's parents were killed in the war when she was a little girl, and as a result she was raised by her grandmother.
</li><li> Chapter 15 of the manga reveals that this is also Riza's backstory. Her mother died when she was a little girl, leaving her to be raised by her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">Mad Scientist</a> father, who died of a lingering illness not long after his alchemy apprentice - Roy - left to join the military. With both parents gone, there was nothing to stop her from following Roy, which she's done ever since.

<ul><li> Most of the Straw Hat crew are victims of this trope, often more than once. Both Nami and Franky, for example, were orphaned at a young age, but taken in and raised by a kind foster parent...only for them to die as well. But they've still got it better than Robin, who didn't just lose her parents, but HER ENTIRE HOME ISLAND, of which she is the only survivor. Most of the others seem to have absentee parents of one form or another; the only member whose mother and father are both seen is Usopp, a victim of both this trope AND <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">Parental Abandonment</a> (his dad left to become a pirate, and his mom died shortly after).
</li><li> For a while, it seemed that Luffy was a victim of this trope as well, his lack of parentage explained with a throwaway remark that "that kid has no parents" in the first chapter. Years later, we learned that Luffy was actually raised by his grandfather, and that his dad, at least, is alive (he's just the most wanted man in the world, which can make it tough to raise a kid).
</li><li> <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Momonosuke</span> is also an orphan, his parents having been murdered by the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Beast Pirates on Kaido's</span> orders when they took over <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Wano Kingdom</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> This trope played so straight in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Toriko">Toriko</a></em> that <em>almost no named character</em> has living parents. Even Teppei (who at least is very close to his grandfather) never said who his father is, despite the presence of only 3 people in the story who have his family trademark hair. And at least Jirou (Teppei's grandpa) and Midora are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">adopted by animals</a> before Acacia found them.

In a twist, Gimmy and Darry are chosen to be exiled to the surface explicitly because they don't have family who will mourn their departure.

This is the main reason Ryu is usually left tending the Phoenix while the others get all of the action; he still has a family that would miss him if anything happened to him.
</li><li> Sousuke Sagara of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Lightnovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em> being rendered an orphan helps justify why he can keep risking his life with no regard for consequences. Although his mother dying for his sake and her dramatic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastWords">Last Words</a> telling him he must "live," "never give up," and "fight!" does have the other purpose of making him the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazySurvivalist">Crazy Survivalist</a> he is today, it mainly seems to serve as a plot device to allow the readers to realize he simply has no one waiting for him.

When Walter replies that she has none and is an orphan, Alucard sardonically replies "Of <em>course</em> she is". However, since Seras was already an adult by the time she died, the circumstances and consequences of her parents' deaths turns out to be a major part of her character and the series veering into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld">Crapsack World</a> territory and running on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndGrayMorality">Black-and-Gray Morality</a>, it's a justified trope.

<ul><li> For that matter, Raditz himself is an orphan, but unlike Son Goku, their father Bardock was alive by the time their planet was obliterated, yet he took little interest in the well being of his sons.

However a recent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retcon">Retcon</a> has their parents send Goku to Earth in order to ensure his survival.
</li><li> Vegeta himself is also an orphan who was in turn was adopted by the tyrant that killed his father and ended his race.
<ul><li> Most, if not all Z warriors have no parents whatsoever; Yamcha is introduced as a teenage desert thief with no parents or guardians mentioned; Krillin was raised by a monastic order on where he was bullied; Tien Shin-Han and Chaotzu seem to have been raised by Crane Hermit; Yajirobe was introduced as a teenage wanderer without mentioned family.
</li></ul></li><li> The unnamed Namekian (the original Namekian survivor that later divided himself into Piccolo and Kami) is himself an orphan who is mentioned to be the son of an individual named Kattas. He spent a great deal of his youth waiting for his parents (or parent, for that matter) to no avail. After he becomes whole once again, he becomes disinterested in his past and even keeps a distance from the remaining survivors of his race.

As a victim of child sex trafficking, Triela's background is unknown even to the Agency. Henrietta's entire family was murdered and Angelica's parents are in prison. Petra's family are too poor to travel from Russian to see their daughter â€” which is just as well as her appearance has been altered completely. It's eventually revealed that they were told she had died. As Rico is one of the few cyborgs who retains memories of her previous life, the occasional visit from her estranged parents is no doubt enough to reassure them that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl">Ill Girl</a> is receiving the best of care; the Agency would have no trouble getting Rico to play along.

Thus, for example, Brew in the <em>The Man Who...</em> series is haunted by the fact that he accidentally killed his brother, but nothing is said about their parents' reaction to the incident; likewise, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheChroniclesOfThomasCovenant">Thomas Covenant</a> apparently had no parents to appeal to for help as his leprosy made him increasingly isolated.

</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em>:
<ul><li> The series as a rule enjoys making their main characters an orphan at some point in the game. Their mothers are rarely mentioned but when they are, they're dead. Their fathers will die at some point in the story for some reason. The sole exception to this so-far is Eliwood, Roy's father in The Sword of Seals who lives throughout the game but is severely bed ridden. On the other hand, both Roy's and Lilina's mothers passed away before the game starts, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lilina loses her father Hector early on, playing this trope straight in her case</span>. The prequel, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTheBlazingBlade">Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword</a></em>, viciously delights in killing off family. It's gotten to the point that if a character has a parent/sibling/uncle that loves them, nine out of ten times they're dead before the game is up, if not killed before it. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Lyn's parents were both killed by bandits, Hector's parents and brother die of disease, Eliwood's dad is killed by Nergal, Raven's parents committed suicide when their house was attacked, Lucius's father was killed and his mother died of sickness, Serra's parents abandoned her, Erk's are absent, both Jaffar and Nino have dead parents, Lowen probably takes the cake though, having lost first his parents, then his grandparents in fairly quick succession.</span>
</li><li> The worst part of Nino's family situation: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Her adopted family are all bosses late in the game. The worst part of it is, they're not bad guys at all, and some of the conversations if you force Nino to attack them are pretty heart wrenching. Worse still, their dead bodies are reanimated in the last level, which means she has to kill them TWICE</span>.
<ul><li> What about the other part? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">When she faces off against Sonia, the woman she thought of as her mother her entire life and who she only wanted to please, the bitch is quite happy to tell Nino how she slaughtered the girl's real parents for their knowledge on dragons and Nino's real mother died shielding her. Oh, and the only reason Sonia didn't kill Nino as well is because she figured Nino might be useful later.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Pretty much every character in <em>Genealogy of Holy War</em> due to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the entire playable cast save Fin, Adeen and Brigrd being wiped out half way through the game leaving their orphaned children to continue the fight seventeen years later</span>. Many other enemies are also orphaned by the player and are out for revenge.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSun">Golden Sun</a></em>, the trope is very much zig-zagged for the main cast.
<ul><li> Isaac's father and Jenna's parents and brother are killed off right in the intro. Then it quickly turns out that the brother survived and seems to be an enemy. Then in the second game, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out the trope is completely subverted: the parents and Isaac's dad also survived and were made hostages, and saving them is a big motivator to the quest. So the kids are not actually orphans... then <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">they accidentally almost kill their own parents themselves</a> near the end of the game</span>. Poor Isaac's mother has to almost force her son to keep going on his quest and is a source of worry, as she falls gravely ill in his absence.
</li><li> Ivan is an orphan and his adoptive father is kidnapped as you meet him, but the trope is toyed with: you're told that you can't do anything about it and you should just leave the father behind, but Ivan worries a lot, and you get an optional sidequest to free his father and ease his mind; and in the second game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Ivan's mysterious parentage is a plot point</span>.
</li><li> Sheba is also an adopted orphan and joins the group because <em>she</em> was kidnapped, but she's an inversion of the trope: in the second game, she refuses to drop by her hometown because her worried adoptive family would force her to stay.
</li><li> Piers is a straight and extreme example: he spends the first half of the game trying to go home, then when he finally does, he learns that his mother just died and he quickly gets exiled.
</li><li> Mia would be a straight example, having simply no mentioned family at all... but she is the one character who is sad to leave (she says farewell to her two young apprentices) and it's more a case of "conveniently rid of her town-healer duties".
</li><li> And Garet is a complete aversion: he's the only cast member who has a large, living and functional family, but they all encourage him to save the world and fatherless Isaac gets more angst; then in the <em>epilogue cutscene</em> of the second game <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Garet comes home, finds the town destroyed, and thinks for a moment that they all died</span>.
</li><li> The first four heroes of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GoldenSunDarkDawn">Golden Sun: Dark Dawn</a></em> all have at least one parent still alive and caring for themâ€” the previous games' heroes (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationXerox">whom the kids strongly resemble</a>). However, the second set of heroes include two straight examples (Sveta, whose parents died in Morgal's revolutionary war, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Eoleo when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificialLion">his father dies onscreen</a></span>), a subversion (Amiti, who doesn't have parents but lives with his affectionate and overprotective uncle, who tries to forbid him from heroics), and an aversion (Himi's parents aren't happy to see her going into danger, but they have to let her because she's the only one who knows what needs to be done any more).
</li></ul></li><li> Implied to be the case with the eponymous characters of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JakAndDaxter">Jak and Daxter</a></em> series. They get flung forward in time in the sequel, and don't have any problem staying around. The orphan thing is explored/confirmed for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Jak</a>, but is still only an implication for Daxter, though <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanon">no one is saying otherwise</a>.

<ul><li> Link is often an orphan. This leaves him with no family to be tied to on his journey.
</li><li> Zelda might also count in some of the games. She definitely counts in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTheWindWaker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a></em>, where her figurine clearly spells it out and an NPC early in the game mentions that her mother died.

All three members of Strega are likely orphans (<span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Jin mentions that they, and other artificial Persona-users were all found on the streets as children</span>). <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheResenter">Yukari</a>'s father is dead, and her mother a hot mess incapable of being any kind of real parent. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ojou">Mitsuru</a>'s mother only appears in a CD drama, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">her father is killed late in the game</span>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadClown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SadClown">Junpei</a> only has a father.

If nothing else, it makes fighting Shadows easier for them.
<ul><li> The parental situation of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona4">Persona 4</a></em> is far better, with the only real orphan being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver">Naoto</a>, and even then, she had been raised by her grandfather the entire time. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenWearPink">Kanji</a>'s father is explicitly stated to be dead, but he still has his mother, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenNonHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenNonHuman">Teddie</a> is <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">a Shadow</span>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero">Yu</a>'s parents travel abroad frequently. Everyone else in the party is from a completely intact family.
</li><li> The tone of the game may help. <em>Persona 3</em> is darker than <em>Persona 4</em> and most of the time, the abandonment is ether a direct or indirect result of the Kirijo group's experimentation on the Shadows, with the other two members having parents that made it personally preferable to live in the dorm.
</li><li> This trope is mostly absent from the two earlier games, with the only cases of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalAbandonment">parental loss</a> coming from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona2">Persona 2</a></em>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IntrepidReporter">Maya</a>'s father, a war journalist, died on the field, and <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass">Jun</a>'s parents, who are both dead by the end of <em>Innocent Sin</em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZigZaggingTrope">but are resurrected when Philemon resets time</a></span>.

</li><li> A recurring element in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesSeries">Tales Series</a>:
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfPhantasia">Tales of Phantasia</a></em>, several party members including the leads Cress and Mint are orphaned very early in the game, several because <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">their parents were a previous generation of heroes who sealed away Dhaos, and who are being targeted for the keys they hold</span>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfVesperia">Tales of Vesperia</a></em>, everyone in your entire party is an orphan. With most of them, all we get is either the parent left or the parent died, or both, no further explanation. We only find out how one parent died, although it's implied (very <em>very</em> subtly) that several of the mothers died in childbirth. In all honesty, it feels a little ridiculous at times.
</li><li> Sorey in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfZestiria">Tales of Zestiria</a></em>, as he was a human raised by seraphs, which was what gave him a strong enough resonance to be the Shepherd. The seraph party members never had family, as spirits born from sites of natural power <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">except Mikleo, who as a baby died in the same event that orphaned Sorey but immediately reincarnated as a seraph and raised alongside Sorey. His mother's technically still alive but in no position to have raised him</span>.
</li><li> Exactly what orphaned Velvet, Laphicet, and Celica Crowe before <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfBerseria">Tales of Berseria</a></em> is not fully explained, but can probably be blamed on the daemons that plague the world. The rest of Velvet's family is eventually stripped away as well. Other human party members Magilou and Eleanor are orphaned as well, also to be blamed on the daemons. Rokurou isn't orphaned, his family just comes from extremely far away <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but he's hinted to have to become a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeOrphan">Self-Made Orphan</a> to succeed the head of his family someday</span>. As with the seraphs in <em>Zestiria</em>, the malakhs are spirits born spontaneously from the world <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">or reincarnated from those who die in specific circumstances</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> Of the seven party members in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Xenoblade">Xenoblade</a></em>, only one of them has a living parent, five are stated to be orphans, and the last's parents are never mentioned. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> The orphan total becomes six later thanks to the parent performing a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice">Heroic Sacrifice</a>.</span>

The "convenient" aspect of the trope is played with in that the orphans are one big dysfunctional family, and several of them are important contributors to the plot.
