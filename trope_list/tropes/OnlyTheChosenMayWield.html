The gods of the world agree with this philosophy and eventually the Goddess of Chaos puts a curse on "Shisou" that anyone who tries to wield him, without her consent, will receive a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath">Cruel and Unusual Death</a> if knowing about the curse but tries anyway. Those that try but don't know about the curse will just receive a nasty electric shock.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Digimon">Digimon</a></em>:
<ul><li> How the Digidestined received their Digimon and powerups (in the form of eggs on stone pillars) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonAdventure02">Digimon Adventure 02</a></em>. Also used at least once in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DigimonFrontier">Digimon Frontier</a></em>.

</li></ul></li><li> In an episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf">Ranma ½</a></em>, Kunō pulls the magic sword Wishbringer out of a stone. Subverted, as he was only able to pull the sword out because he was the one-millionth to try. However, once he claims ownership, Wishbringer will only listen to his voice.
</li><li> The Escudo weapons from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicKnightRayearth">Magic Knight Rayearth</a></em>. If anyone else tries to wield them, Hikaru's catches on fire, Umi's turns into water and Fuu's gets incredibly heavy.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYasha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/InuYasha">Inuyasha</a></em>:
<ul><li> Tessaiga was meant for Inuyasha and only allows Inuyasha to wield it. If its power is stolen that power will find its way back to Inuyasha as quickly as possible. Although it possesses a barrier that prevents full <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Youkai">youkai</a> from touching it, that barrier is a magical addition to determine who cannot wield the sword rather than who can.
</li><li> Tenseiga was given to Sesshoumaru and it only allows him to wield it. Even though he doesn't want the sword, the sword wants him. He even tried breaking the sword and throwing it away once. Tenseiga promptly reforged itself and returned to him — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClingyMacGuffin">he can't get rid of this weapon even when he tries</a>.
</li><li> Toukijin was an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilWeapon">Evil Weapon</a> so powerful it could even possess its own creator, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UltimateBlacksmith">Ultimate Blacksmith</a> Toutousai couldn't even approach. Sesshoumaru was so powerful, it couldn't possess him, so it accepted Sesshoumaru as its wielder and true master. At least until Sesshoumaru's compassion finally became too powerful for the sword's hate and shattered the sword, that is.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/IkkiTousen">Ikki Tousen</a></em> has five swords - the "Hyakuhekitou" - that were stuck in one stone. One <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bad</a> manages to free several of them at once by destroying the stone.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater">Soul Eater</a></em>, all weapons are assigned to a particular partner upon enrollment in Shibusen, based on the interlocking personalities of the weapon and meister. Generally speaking, it is impossible for a weapon to be wielded by someone who isn't their partner because their inner natures tend to clash. Adult Meisters/Weapons appear to be free of this restriction, which is said to have something to do with the fact that wielding a Weapon is about how the souls of both meister and Weapon react to one another, and seems to rely on some level of mutual understanding and compromise - too much conflict spoils the resonance and people get hurt, or even fall flat on the ground if they happen to be up in the air when you start arguing. As such, it's implied that the Adults are much better at handling their composure, allowing for a wider range of partners. This isn't to say if an Adult pair start to argue they'll stop resonating, or that there are pairs that would never be able to work, just that that's never been depicted in the series. The fact that most Adults seem to have a preferred/assigned partner supports this.
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Excalibur" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Excalibur">Excalibur</a> is also present in the series and is the only weapon who averts this trope by being <em>potentially</em> able to be wielded by anyone: His numerous powers include the ability to adjust his soul wavelength to go along perfectly with anyone... Except his personality is so extremely obnoxious that no-one <em>wants</em> to get within two leagues of him.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalCircleGuruGuru" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MagicalCircleGuruGuru">Magical Circle Guru-Guru</a></em>, the magic sword of light, Kira Kira, can only be called upon by a true Hero.
</li><li> Several weapons in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilentMobius" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SilentMobius">Silent Möbius</a></em> are bound to specific bloodlines. Grosspoliner's connexion to the Liqueur blood is a plot point.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeroTales" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeroTales">Hero Tales</a></em> has the Kenkaranpu, which can only be drawn by a "true hero". In the first chapter Taito was able to draw it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">but it was promptly stolen...</span>
</li><li> Meta Knight's legendary sword Galaxia in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a></em> will shock (sometimes to death) anyone not powerful enough to wield it if they so much as touch it. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicWeapon">It will also demand to know who they are and what they think they're doing.</a>
</li><li> The Z Sword from the Buu Saga of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> is suggested to be such a weapon in Kai legend, but in reality it just seems that it's <em>really, really heavy</em>. It's stuck in a stone pillar on a planet in the afterlife, and Gohan has to go Super Saiyan 2 before he can pull it out. It's still incredibly heavy once it's removed, too - he can barely lift it without transforming. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Then the good guys <em>break it</em> by accident while training, releasing the old Kaioshin sealed within it, who turns out to be a lot more helpful than the sword itself.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RosarioToVampire">Rosario + Vampire</a></em>, Moka's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerLimiter">Power Limiter</a> rosary can only be properly removed by Tsukune.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Pokemon">Pokémon</a></em> anime, it is stated that the Pokemon will only obey the original person that caught, trained, and raised it (and only if it considers him/her worthy). So care must be taken when loaning other people your Pokemon, or gifting them to others, or trading them to instruct the creature to "do whatever so-and-so tells you to do." The best example of this being Ash's Charmander, which becomes rebellious when it evolves to a Charmander/Charmeleon, as it belonged to another trainer before joining him.
<ul><li> This is averted, however, if the Pokémon are familiar enough with the individuals in the group. For example, Ash's Pokémon have no issues with obeying Misty or Brock when separated from Ash, even without permission. It can also be averted with certain Pokémon that are loaned to trainers and trained to (temporarily) obey whoever is controlling them; even so, their original trainers can reassert control if it's necessary (such as when Team Rocket tried to steal some of them).
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SDGundamForce">SD Gundam Force</a></em> gives us Musha Daishinshou, a semi-sentient <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha">Humongous Mecha</a> that can only be controlled by The Dai-Shogun, surpeme ruler of Ark. It's stated that without the Dai-Shogun, Daishinshou would go on a rampage, so it spends most of the series <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan">locked up in a castle.</a> Villain Kibaomaru thinks <em>he</em> can use Daishinshou, and looks for a means of releasing it. It's revealed that the one to use Daishinshou is the one who has the power to release it; <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> his son, Genkimaru.</span>
</li><li> One appears in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/UQHolder">UQ Holder!</a></em>, where Touta is naturally the one to pull it out. Turns out it was a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GravityMaster">gravity-controlling sword</a>, and Touta was the only one to notice it had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek">switch</a> to make it light enough to pull out.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a></em>, certain cards can only be wielded by a chosen duelist, including the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhysicalGod">Egyptian Gods</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalefulPolymorph">Legendary Dragons/Knights of Atlantis</a>, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination">Earthbound Gods</a>, and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantAwesomeJustAddDragons">Signer Dragons</a>.

</li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenLanternRing">Green Lantern Ring</a> is also sentient, to an unknown extent, and picky about wielders, requiring insane strength of will - for instance, it doesn't usually take teenagers, but it's willing to relax its rules in that specific regard where necessary (i.e. where the wielder meets every other requirement and the fate of the universe is at stake).
</li><li> The Swords of the Cross (including <em>Amoracchius</em>, the sword most people think of as Excalibur) are also choosy. At best, they simply won't do anything more than an ordinary sword, or <em>be</em> anything more than an ordinary sword. At worst, they will bite. <em>Hard.</em>
</li><li> The original Excalibur actually subverts this trope. Which only the Chosen is <em>meant</em> to wield it, it's based on the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Merlin2008">Merlin (2008)</a></em> version, which is more like the Sword in the Stone - it started out as an ordinary but excellent sword, got reforged/enchanted in the flames of a dragon, leaving it able to (among other things) kill the undead. However, anyone who got their hands on it could theoretically wield it, which is exactly why it got stuffed in a rock by Merlin in the first place, to prevent anyone he didn't allow from removing it. As mentioned, the second Excalibur, <em>Amoracchius</em>, plays it straight.
<ul><li> Related to that, Harry's sword follows a very similar path: it's forged by Uhtred, a very talented but otherwise ordinary young warrior and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBlacksmith">blacksmith</a> out of ordinary materials... or their Asgardian versions, anyway. Then, it gets reforged/enchanted by the connivance of Doctor Strange, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> who grew up in Camelot and witnessed the original at work,</span> under similar circumstances. Doctor Strange's enchantments wove these together, and ensured they had lasting effects. No one's entirely sure what all of those are yet, but one of the things that Loki immediately identifies is that Harry should be very careful who he lets touch it, as it might... <em>bite.</em>

It is also important to note not every wielder is meant to be a life-long Knight. Many Knights are one-timers, who take up the Sword during some crisis, wield it to victory, and leave it aside once the danger has past. Note that unworthy mortals can still <em>pick up</em> and fight with the Swords, but the weapons don't provide them with any particular advantage over plain steel. Moreover, if a treacherous person is given authority over the blade, say the Knight gives a thief the Sword to defend himself when the Knight is out of commission, wielding a Sword in a treacherous or unjust manner renders the holy blade vulnerable to destruction, either physical or (if used to kill an innocent) spiritual.
</li><li> Also there are the respective Mantles of the Summer and Winter Knights. Each Knight is selected for the position by one of the court's three Queens. In order of strongest to weakest, they are The Queen Who Was, The Queen Who Is, and The Queen Who Will Be. Now, while a Knight could be considered suitable by one of the Queens, if an older one deems the Knight unworthy, they can kill the Knight and claim the mantle to select a new knight.

<ul><li> The Master Sword in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">The Legend of Zelda</a></em> games. Whenever the sword appears in the series, Link is invariably the only person who can pull it out of the stone.
<ul><li> In some games, Link has to prove that he is the ancient legends' prophesied Hero before he is able to draw the sword. Before winning the Pendants of Virtue in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaALinkToThePast">A Link to the Past</a></em>, Link will not be able to pull the Master Sword. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">Ocarina of Time</a></em>, the sword sits on the other side of a massive stone door that only opens with the gathering of the three Spiritual Stones.
</li><li> In other cases, the game prevents Link from finding it (and the plot usually doesn't even make mention of it) until a certain point. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaTwilightPrincess">Twilight Princess</a></em>, for example, Link is chosen from the get-go, being a descendant of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime">the Hero of Time</a> and the bearer of the Triforce of Courage (which is explained when he's granted the clothes of the hero). When he goes to get the Master Sword, it's simply a matter of finding it; it did not require any kind of proof of the gods (other than possibly having to solve their puzzle, which itself may only have required his lineage to complete). A similar circumstance transpires in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HyruleWarriors">Hyrule Warriors</a></em>, where the primary difficulty in getting the sword is the army of ghost soldiers who are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy">being manipulated to stop him from reaching it</a>. It should be noted that in both of the above cases, Link has already accomplished a number of heroic feats by the time he goes for the Master Sword, which may be proof enough for the gods without the need for additional tests.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaSkywardSword">Skyward Sword</a></em>, as the chronologically first <em>Zelda</em> game, serves as something of an origin story for the Master Sword. It starts off as the Goddess Sword, which doesn't have the chosen-hero-exclusive circumstances; during his first battle, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Ghirahim</a> will catch your sword if you telegraph your attacks, rip it out of your hands, and wield it himself. However, once it is reforged in the flames of the Golden Goddesses and bathed in the power to repel evil, Ghirahim is reduced to trying to stop the blade from even touching him. (Phantom rematches with the first fight courtesy of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BossRush">the Thunder Dragon's Lightning Round</a> still allow him to catch and wield it, but nobody takes that as having story impact.) The text box that appears after <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Zelda</span> blesses the sword, finally unlocking its full power, even specifically says that Link is now the only one who can wield it.
</li><li> This leads to some tension between Link and Zelda in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild">Breath of the Wild</a></em>. In preparation for the coming of Calamity Ganon, Link is quickly found to be the true wielder of the Master Sword and is made Zelda's bodyguard in response. Zelda, on the other hand, is unable to unlock her "Sealing Power" necessary to defeat Ganon; she thus finds Link's presence a constant reminder of her own failure to fulfill her destiny.

The Amulet of Kings can only be worn by those of royal blood, recognizing them as Alessia's (and Akatosh's) metaphysical heirs to the Ruby Throne of Cyrodiil and confirming those who can wear it as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne">The Chosen One</a>.

Whether this is for real or a story made up to scare off pretenders is never discovered. However, certain moments imply that being the Nerevarine is more a matter of <em>becoming</em> than something you are born as — if you fulfill the requirements to be the Nerevarine, and follow what the prophecy says the Nerevarine is supposed to do, then you <em>are</em> the Nerevarine, and so can wear Moon-and-Star.

While the artifacts themselves aren't sentient, the Daedric Princes who created them can be really picky about who uses them. For example, Hircine, not liking a werewolf who uses his ring removes all control the man has over his transformations (though if you attempt to help the werewolf Hircine will make the ring work correctly for you) while one necromancer spent decades working defects into Azura's star to remove her control over it so he could live forever using it.

A hero stumbles upon a sword in a stone, and having heard the legend of weapons of such power being lodged in rocks, yanks at it with all his strength. This results in the sword not budging an inch. So he spends the next hour or so with a hammer and chisel to retrieve it. Played straight in the campaign "The True Blade". The Gryphonheart blade can only be drawn by a member of the Gryphonheart lineage. Sir Worton tries to wrest control over the little kingdom of Palaedra from its founder Lord Lysander (who had previously refused to be king because of his loyalty to the Gryphonheart line) by drawing a forgery of the blade from its scabbard.

He also has a copy of True Rider's magic strength-enhancing sash, Goddess of War, because in life, he killed her and took it. It is mentioned that since True Rider is the true owner of Goddess of War, her version of the sash is more powerful than his.
</li><li> Saber has a Noble Phantasm called Excalibur: Sword of Forever Distant Victory, which gives him the ability to turn anything he holds into a copy of the legendary blade Excalibur, based on his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve">sincere belief</a> that anything he holds <em>is</em> Excalibur.

</li><li> One of Lancer Karna's Noble Phantasms, Brahmastra, is shared by the Saber Rama. In this case, it's because this particular weapon was capable of being wielded by multiple people across the various epics of their legends.
</li><li> One of Queen Medb's Noble Phantasms, Fergus My Love, allows her to summon and wield Fergus' Noble Phantasm, Caladbolg: The Rainbow Sword. This is because Fergus was her lover in life and they shared many gifts.
</li><li> One of King David's Noble Phantasms is Hamesh Avanim, the sling and stones he used to defeat Goliath. Lore-wise, because of how he used it to knock Goliath out and then steal his sword, if he uses it to knock out a Servant, he can swipe their Noble Phantasm and use it. Even better, the Noble Phantasm becomes David's by divine authority, so the Servant will be unable to take it back.
</li><li> Lore-wise, Sir Gawain can wield Excalibur because there were times King Arthur loaned it to him in life, plus he had proven himself worthy of its sister sword Galatine.
</li><li> In life, King Arthur gave Excalibur to Sir Bedivere so he could return it to the Lady of the Lake, but in this verse, he kept the sword and Merlin eventually modified it into an artificial arm for him. He has a Noble Phantasm called "Switch On - Airgetlám", his artificial arm, which he can eventually turn into Excalibur to wield.
</li><li> Merlin is able to use Excalibur since besides the Lady of the Lake, he was one of its true owners and gave it to King Arthur in the first place.
</li><li> Lore-wise, one of Musashibou Benkei's Noble Phantasms, called Eighth Implement, like True Archer in <em>strange fake</em>, is the ability to steal and use his enemies' Noble Phantasms against them.
</li><li> Penthesilea has the strength-enhancing sash Goddess of War because she is the sister of True Rider from <em>strange fake</em>.
</li><li> The Rider Mandricardo is able to wield the Lancer Hektor's spear Durindana. This is due to the connection of their legends, as Mandricardo is able to wield the sword Durandal, which was repurposed by Hektor into Durindana and was restored to its original form some time after his death. Since the sword and spear are simply two forms of the same weapon, they can wield either one without issue. Particularly notable since Mandricardo <em>isn't</em> summoned with Durandal because he lost it and never got it back before his death in legend, and in fact has a Noble Phantasm called Serment de Durandal that lets him give Durandal's power to any weapon he possesses, even another Noble Phantasm. By extension, this also means Roland, the man most famous for wielding Durandal, would also be able to wield Durindana without issue.
</li><li> Lore-wise, Astolfo's Hippogriff originally belonged to Bradamante, and he traded his spear Trap of Argalia to her for it, which means she would be able to use them too.

Theoretically, she should be able to wield Caliburn, Excalibur, and Avalon as well.

In the <em>Cosmos in the Lostbelt</em> storyline, Galahad decides to stop helping the heroes and revokes the powers he gave to Mash. Mash finds herself unable to use Lord Camelot anymore. Ritsuka Fujimaru uses a Command Spell to order Galahad to help them, but he resists, leaving Mash with only a fraction of his power.

When the evil ghost Grune the Destroyer stole it and tried to use it, it zapped and banished him. And when Lion-O himself tries to use it for hunting, the sword embeds itself into the ground and refuses to harm defenseless animals.

<ul><li> In the Season Four premiere, the Mane Six were forced to give up the physical embodiments of the Elements of Harmony, which took the form of five necklaces (for Kindness, Laughter, Loyalty, Honesty, and Generosity) and a tiara (for Magic). As Twilight Sparkle suspected, the girls have become so connected to the Elements that they no longer need those symbols to use their power—they can summon the magic on their own.
</li><li> Season Four's story arc also had each of the Mane Six facing a difficult choice about her particular Element (for example, Applejack, who represents Honesty, had to decide whether or not to expose a phony elixir that had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlaceboEffect">Placebo Effect</a> on ponies, including her own grandmother).
