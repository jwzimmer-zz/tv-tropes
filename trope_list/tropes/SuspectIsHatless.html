<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder0');">    Anime and Manga </div><div class="folder" id="folder0" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> The first episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TriGun">Trigun</a></em> has the insurance girls and several groups of bounty hunters looking for Vash the Stampede. Each of them is using a different description of Vash that is technically accurate, but is also vague enough that it also describes one of the bounty hunters ("blonde man with red coat"). Confusion ensues.
</li><li> In one <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DetectiveConan">Detective Conan</a></em> case, the police are trying to apprehend a criminal and catch three suspects. The case seems ridiculously easy when they find three eyewitnesses... but then each of those witnesses give vague descriptions (that the criminal was wearing sunglasses, that the criminal was very tall, and that the criminal was an old woman) and <em>none</em> of those traits match any of the suspects. The police eventually have to figure out what conditions took place to cause each of the eyewitnesses to see the traits they saw, and which suspect all three applied to.
</li><li> One of the powers of Assassin of Black (Jack the Ripper) in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateApocrypha">Fate/Apocrypha</a></em> is to invoke this. Anyone who fights Assassin and survives the fight quickly forgets all details of their opponent, so they cannot describe Assassin to anyone else, or recognize Assassin should their paths cross again. This stems from the fact that the powers of Servants are derived from their legends, and a key part of Jack the Ripper's legend is the fact that Jack was never conclusively identified.
</li><li> In one chapter of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf">Dragon Half</a></em>, Rosario and Vina independently summon up monsters and send them to kill Mink, describing her as having horns, wings, and a tail. Since both monsters also meet this description, they end up killing each other before running into Mink.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackLagoon">Black Lagoon</a></em>, the L'homme Sombre arc kicks off with five women searching Roanapur for a tall black man. While that would be unusual in most of Thailand, Roanapur is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive">Wretched Hive</a> attracting all sorts of criminals and within a couple days, they've already questioned at least six such men.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei">Sekirei</a></em>, Benitsubasa calls the Izumo Inn and demands to speak to the "big-breasted woman". Among the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredAndEight">108</a> Sekirei, there's maybe ten who don't fit that description and half those are men or children.
</li><li> One <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Patlabor">Patlabor</a></em> OVA centers around the men searching for a bomber in a public bathhouse, with the only information they had to identify the suspect being a description of an <em>armpit</em>. The gang goes through a number of crazy hijinks trying to examine the armpits of every man washing up, which ultimately starts a huge brawl. And in the end in turned out to be for nothing, as the perp was female, and SV2 had sent the only female member present to report in to headquarters, leaving nobody to search the women's side of the baths.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/BigFinishDoctorWho">Big Finish Doctor Who</a></em> audio "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWhoNEDASRavenous4E3DayOfTheMaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/BigFinishDoctorWhoNEDASRavenous4E3DayOfTheMaster">Day of the Master</a>", when the Eighth Doctor asks his companion Liv to describe which incarnation of the Master she just met, Liv is only able to describe him as "bearded, urbane and a bit sadistic". This is an accurate description of the Master Liv met, who is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekJacobi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DerekJacobi">the War Master</a>, but the Doctor notes that the description could apply to many incarnations of the Master, which thus prevents the Doctor realising that this version of the Master is from his relative future.
</li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Comic Books </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> In one issue of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrooTheWanderer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/GrooTheWanderer">Groo the Wanderer</a></em>, Groo asks a passerby whether he has seen the man who was standing next to where Groo was standing a while back.
</li><li> Subverted in the third <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Valhalla" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Valhalla">Valhalla</a></em> album, when Thor tries to describe his encounter with a mysterious stranger. Loki asks "How many eyes did he have?", and it occurs to Thor that the stranger was, in fact, <em>one-eyed</em>, which means it was probably Odin (who has been missing for a while).
</li><li> Bruce Wayne <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope">invokes</a> this trope in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanYearOne" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/BatmanYearOne">Batman: Year One</a></em>. When creating a disguise (pre-Batsuit), he dresses in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNondescript" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNondescript">generic clothing</a>, and adds a large fake facial scar, noting that "a single identifying mark" is all most people will remember, despite his face being otherwise completely unconcealed.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheBlueLotus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TintinTheBlueLotus">The Blue Lotus</a></em>, the Fakir warns Tintin to watch out for a dark-haired Asian man with glasses. The story takes place in China.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Youngblood2017">Youngblood (2017)</a></em> begins with a character trying to report her missing friend to the police. The problem? They're both superheroes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity">and she doesn't know his real name or what he looks like without a mask</a>. The best that she can give is his hero name (Man-Up) and the fact that he's tall.
</li><li> Parodied in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedEars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedEars">Red Ears</a></em>. A woman filing a police report gives an incredibly precise description of her rapist's appearance (muscular, balding, red beard, black glasses, yellow bowtie, striped green-maroon jacket, beige trenchcoat, grey fedora) to the police officer interviewing her, but he doesn't seem to notice that she's talking about his lieutenant.

Anyone trying to describe him would focus on those two aspects which are easily removed. In reality, Xander is unrelated to the crime they're investigating and while the eye patch is real, the doodling is because he fell asleep on the bus with a group of teenagers.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Octopussy">Octopussy</a></em>, as Bond speeds through the American Air Base's security checkpoint to stop a bomb from detonating, the Security Guard has only this to say:
<div class="indent"><strong>Security Guard:</strong> Captain, some nut drove through here in a stolen car. Wants the base commander, and he's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedScare">wearing a red shirt!</a>
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenGun">The Man with the Golden Gun</a></em>, when Bond talks to Miss Anders about Scaramanga:
<div class="indent"><strong>Bond:</strong> How will I recognize him? <br/><strong>Anders:</strong> Tall, slim and dark. <br/><strong>Bond:</strong> So's my aunt. <br/><strong>Anders:</strong> Yes, but how can I tell you?

But probably the most useless piece of information I've ever heard. Unless, of course, the "Bottoms Up" is a strip club and Scaramanga is performing.
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Desperado" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Desperado">Desperado</a></em>, the first description Bucho gets of Navajas is that he has brown hair and eyes, which Bucho points out, is not exactly distinctive in Mexico. The description then goes on to list some actually useful information.
<ul><li> The first movie <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElMariachi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ElMariachi">El Mariachi</a></em> plays this straight, which is what kicks off the plot as there's two men "dressed in black, carrying a guitar case" walking around town. Apart from that, neither of them look anything like each other.
</li></ul></li><li> From <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BartonFink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BartonFink">Barton Fink</a></em>:
<div class="indent"><strong>Barton Fink:</strong> He... he said he liked Jack Oakie pictures. <br/><em>[beat]</em> <br/><strong>Detective Mastrionotti:</strong> You know, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you, Fink. That is not helpful.
</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fargo">Fargo</a></em>, none of the witnesses can describe Carl Showalter (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBuscemi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SteveBuscemi">Steve Buscemi</a>) as anything more than "kinda funny looking" ("in a general way"). Well, except the one hooker who says he was uncircumcised. Meanwhile, his partner-in-crime Gaear Grimsrud (played by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterStormare" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PeterStormare">Peter Stormare</a>) is only described as "Swedish".
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Se7en" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Se7en">Se7en</a></em>, Detective Mills interviews John Doe's neighbors, and gets descriptions of a man between ages 30 and 40, between 150 and 160 pounds, and between and in height.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BatmanBegins">Batman Begins</a></em>, you can't help but feel sorry for the Gotham cops trying to describe the Tumbler to the dispatcher.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airheads" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Airheads">Airheads</a></em>, Officer Wilson is told to look for Kayla, Chazz's girlfriend, on the Sunset Strip in LA.

How did you know that? <br/><strong>Leland Stottlemeyer:</strong> 'Cause that's what they always say. That's scrap paper.
</div></li><li> In "Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger," Randy is chasing down a streaker who's been disrupting police press conferences.
<div class="indent"><strong>Randy Disher:</strong> <em>[on radio]</em> Were on foot, heading south towards Prospect! <br/><strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Is there a description? <br/><strong>Randy Disher:</strong> Hes wearing... gray sneakers. <br/><strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Is there anything else? <br/><strong>Randy Disher:</strong> Hes not Jewish!
</div></li><li> The novel <em>Mr. Monk and the Blue Flu</em> has a hit-and-run where the witnesses can't seem to agree on what model of car was being driven, only that it's a sedan. Monk figures out that this is because the killer smeared mud all over the car to make it hard to identify.

<div class="indent"><strong>Columbo:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">Well, that clears that up.</a>

That's all he's got.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> episode "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", a police force has The Stupendous Yappi, a psychic detective on the payroll:
<div class="indent"><strong>Cop:</strong> Look, all I know is that so far, Yappi has provided more solid, concrete leads on this case than you have. Now, if you don't mind, I have to get an A.P.B. out on a white male, age seventeen to thirty-four, with or without a beard, maybe a tattoo... who's impotent. Let's go. <br/><strong>Scully:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode">Might as well go home, Mulder, this case is as good as solved.</a>
</div></li><li> This applies to direction giving. In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Cheers">Cheers</a></em>, Carla complains that Woody's directions to his house are useless because he told her he's in an apartment over a shop with dead ducks in the window. Because he lives in Chinatown, <em>all</em> of the shops have dead ducks in the windows, mutters Carla.
<ul><li> Similarly, an episode begins with Rebecca offering to take a drunk patron home. He can only identify his house as "blue" (also "You'll know if when you see it.")
</li><li> Sam once tries to describe one of his past sexual conquests, who works for Robin Colcord as a secretary. The only description Sam can give is "blond and wears boots". Robin deadpans that she sounds like one of his employees.
</li></ul></li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych">Psych</a></em> episode "Psy vs. Psy", Shawn tries to get a look at a suspect on a security camera, but can't see him very well. Later, when trying to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhonyPsychic">"psychically"</a> see the suspect, the best he can come up with is "did not wear corrective lenses".
</li><li> Happens to Richard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle">Castle</a> when, owing to a chain of circumstances, he ends up outside while the police are storming a suspect's headquarters only for the suspect to (rather slowly) drive right past him. He misses the license plate, can't see anyone clearly through the tinted windows and ends up only able to vaguely describe the car to the cops, who — given that he's based a very lucrative mystery-writing career on describing things in detail — are less-than-impressed.
<div class="indent"><strong>Castle:</strong> I... it is hard work being a witness. I'm surprised you catch anyone.
</div></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder">Law &amp; Order</a></em>:
<ul><li> An early episode features an entire street full of people who have been dragged down to the precinct after a murder who can only offer vague, contradictory and nearly-useless descriptions of the victim, the suspect, and exactly what happened between them. Some of the witnesses were standing right next to one or both of these parties. The cops, not surprisingly, are a little exasperated. This episode was a comment on homelessness in New York at the time. Many of the witnesses were mentally ill people who had been dumped on the streets. The one moderately functional one says she didn't see anything because she doesn't have the glasses social services has been promising to get for her, and asks the cops if they can help her with that. Finally, one of the people, who is quite elderly, and was initially dismissed, actually turns out to be the healthiest, sanest person there, with some useful information.
</li><li> In the episode "License to Kill," the detectives try to get a description of a vehicle that was involved in a serious accident and most of the descriptions contradict each other. The only thing all the witnesses agree on is that the vehicle had a yellow ribbon bumper sticker, which is not useful at all because these bumper stickers are very common (and, usually being magnetic, very easily removed). In a subversion, there turns out to be a good reason for the differing descriptions: <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there were two vehicles</span>.

<ul><li> In one episode, three people witness a child abduction, and none of the statements they give to police are consistent with each other. For instance, they can't agree on what color the kidnapper's van was, or even what race the kidnapper might have been. In this case, the viewer actually has the whole story, as they saw the abduction as well.
</li><li> An earlier episode also involving a kidnapping has three witnesses give different descriptions of the car that was used to abduct the victim. One of them ends up being right.
</li><li> Another episode has a suspect in a rape case be described as a young black man "wearing a hoodie."
<div class="indent"><strong>John Munch:</strong> Well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">that narrows it down</a>.
</div></li><li> In "Raw", Stabler tries to interview a group of children who were present at a playground shooting. Given that they're all young kids, the statements end up being...less than helpful.
<div class="indent"><strong>Cragen:</strong> Kids give you anything? <br/><strong>Elliot:</strong> Yeah, about 40 different versions about what happened. <br/><strong>Cragen:</strong> Well, eyewitness accounts are bad enough with adults, what'd you expect from kids? <br/><strong>Huang:</strong> Wild imaginations, high suggestibility, and difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality. <br/><strong>Elliot:</strong> That's pretty much what I got.

The next scene begins with Colby relaying a report.
<div class="indent"><strong>Colby:</strong> So, LAPD has a couple bystanders who say they can describe the guy. <em>[pauses, his expression implying it's unhelpful]</em> He was Caucasian, medium build, brown hair.
</div><ul><li> Surprise, surprise, they don't get the guy (though they do eventually track down the gun).

During the crime scene investigation, Krawczyk's description of the shooters is, "I told you I saw only the one. I know he was black. Big, I thought. With a large weapon." Or, as Bunk puts it when debriefing Rawls, a classic "BNBG" - "Big Negro Big Gun." This is especially ironic because Omar not only has a distinctive outfit (duster, do-rag and flak jacket) but also a <em>huge</em> facial scar. Not that it means much to Bunk, who immediately knows Omar was behind it due to his past run-ins with him.

They have no official records of what he looked like and Drew made sure to destroy all photos of himself before he disappeared.

In the other episode, he sees both the suspect and his <em>passport,</em> but even under hypnosis, he can only describe the suspect as angry and the passport as blue (which, as McGee is quick to point out, is the most common color for passports, so they can't even begin to narrow down a country).

<ul><li> <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GuessWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/GuessWho">Guess Who</a></em> is the embodiment of this trope. Players start with a bunch of similar looking people and have to whittle down this list by getting additional information from the other player by asking identifying questions - such as, "Is your person bald?" "Does your person wear glasses?" "Does your person have freckles?"...and, of course: "Is your person wearing a hat?"
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MageTheAscension">Mage: The Ascension</a></em>, the Arcane ability weaponizes this trope. It messes with the victim's recollections so they cannot provide an accurate description (they'll forget some of these: age, hair color, clothing, items carried, even sex). While more costly, it can be more powerful when used on multiple targets, since their descriptions will conflict with each other. Even if someone remembers you well, everyone else will insist that their memories are also accurate. Higher ranks of Arcane will also cause photographs of you to beceome blurry, and database entries about you to disappear.

A radio broadcast gives what seems to be a fairly detailed description of the serial killer on the loose, but that description basically boils down to coat, hat, and scarf, plus they are 'medium build'.

<ul><li> There is a race where everyone drives a red McLaren, but police will still say "suspect is driving a red McLaren" (which is admittedly accurate enough, given how few of those exist; just pull over any red McLaren you see!) Also, in other races if you go fast enough, they'll sometimes only get the colour of your vehicle.
</li><li> Averted in the very first Hot Pursuit, where cops would give out more detail, for example, "Half-mile from Summit Tunnel".
</li><li> <em>Hot Pursuit 2010</em> provides us with this example:
<div class="indent"><strong>Police Dispatcher:</strong> Suspect is in the sand, heading toward the rocks!
</div></li><li> In the original Hot Pursuit, as well as High Stakes, cops refer to any add-on car as a "Sports Car", regardless of whatever the car actually is. This is a reuse of the chatter used when the player drives the fictional El Nino.
</li><li> <em>Most Wanted</em> (and <em>Carbon</em>, by extension, since it reuses a lot of scanner chatter) has varying levels of this when the dispatcher reports she doesn't have the make or model of your car. Sometimes it's reasonable but frustrating ("Hold on for the description, we're having a bit of trouble with our translator) sometimes it falls squarely into this trope ("Caller says it's a sports car." You can practically hear the dispatcher rolling her eyes).
</li></ul></li><li> There's a non-criminal variant in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em>, in which the best description the Lone Wanderer can come up with for his/her own father is "middle-aged." Also, when the player has a bounty placed on them, it gives only their name, sex and race.
</li><li> Trying to describe spies in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2">Team Fortress 2</a></em> to teammates can fall into this trope. Shouting the spy's disguise might work if he's in the heart of battle, but if he's just changed (which good players do often) or has the knife "Your Eternal Reward", it's likely he's someone completely different or invisible.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsInTheSky">The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</a> - Second Chapter</em>: While investigating the circumstances affecting a town's water supply, the team learns some information that a suspicious man wearing dark glasses was seen going around the area.
</li><li> Happens in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/LANoire">L.A. Noire</a></em>. One witness can only describe a suspected criminal as 'sorta average'.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAuto">Grand Theft Auto</a></em> series in general has the police giving highly generic descriptions over the radio, likely to cut down on voice work. A stolen police car is a "police car", a sports car of any make is simply designated by "[color] sports car", the same likewise applies to any generalization of vehicle type, and a military attack chopper is bizarrely a "red helicopter" (this is due to it having red as its default color code, despite the military paint job; red paint chips even flake off if you hit something). Not that this stops any police officer from knowing it's you from this generic description. Later games subvert this by having the radio controller initially give vague descriptions of the player's vehicle, but start giving more specific ones as the chase goes on, including the car's make and model. These details can still be vague/incorrect in the case of add-on cars including Rockstar's own creations, double subverting this trope.

<ul><li> Niko is hired by Playboy X to kill someone. Unfortunately his description is unhelpful, to say the least:
<div class="indent"><strong>Playboy X:</strong> Son ain't too diesel or nuthin', but he a regular lookin' dude, knowwhatimean? And he don't flash his guac too much, but you can see it in his eye, he a hustler. <br/><strong>Niko:</strong> Eh? <br/><strong>Playboy X:</strong> Homie ain't too brollic, but he ain't scrawny neither, and he beats down on him a little, you dig? I mean, he ain't too bummy, but he grimy, too. <br/><strong>Niko:</strong> ...so he's the average one? <br/><strong>Playboy X:</strong> Look, he brown skinned, B! Motherfucker be rockin' baggy clothes, all that, jewels - and he stay fresh with the clean sneakers, knowwhatimean? But sometimes a bandanna. <br/><strong>Niko:</strong> Look, I need more than that to go on.
</div><ul><li> At this point X gives up and gives Niko a camera phone so he can go to the place the guy hangs out and send him pictures so he can point out who the target is.

When Niko asks him if he's afraid Niko will rat him out, one of the several reasons he says he is <em>not</em> is the fact that they are sitting in a building with at least a hundred people matching his description (paunchy, middle aged, glasses).
</li></ul></li><li> The infamous torture mission in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GrandTheftAutoV">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em> works on this. Michael is charged with shooting a target wanted by the FIB. Trevor is supposed to get a description of the target from a witness by torturing him. The witness gives only generic descriptors (has a beard, smokes a lot) while Michael is facing down a house party full of people who match the description. This results in either a <em>very</em> long torture session gathering enough "hatless" hints to narrow it down to one guy, or Michael getting fed up and shooting someone at random, depending on the player's choices.
</li><li> Happens a few times in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/AceAttorney">Ace Attorney</a></em>, although there's most always an actual reason for it. One such time is in the third case of <em>Investigations</em>, where a witness can't recall any details apart from "they were two men". <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">This was because she was sitting way too far away to be able to tell even the fact that the "two men" were wearing mascot costumes. In fact, it so happens she had even guessed at the two people being men (which turns out to be incorrect, as one of them was a woman), so in the end all her testimony boiled down to was that they were "two people".</span> For the most part, descriptions of witnesses tend to fall onto one point, justified by the fact that these points <em>are</em> very unusual and eye-catching. For example, one case involves a witness claiming that the killer wore a "Nickel Samurai" outfit. A lot of testimonies also tend to have the witness' identification simply be some variation of: "That person was the defendant who's sitting over there."

The assassins provide only one clue to start, which may be what color top/trousers their mark is wearing, the target's gender, or indeed whether or not they are wearing a hat (note: males with head kerchiefs are considered hatless). As you spot false targets, they will gradually give you further hints that help narrow it down.

<ul><li> This is one of the reasons why witness testimony isn't considered very reliable in court: people just don't pay attention to these kinds of things until they become significant, at which point the criminal is halfway gone and it's too late. Fortunately, a halfway decent cop will, when taking down a report from a victim (or a witness statement later), use questions and techniques to get some crucial details down where possible: gender, age, colour, height, build, hair, clothing/jewelry, distinguishing marks, any reason you'd remember him and was he carrying anything. And that's just the first set of things the cop will ask about.
</li><li> In the USA, AMBER Alerts are always sent out when certain criteria are met after a child goes missing or is known to have been abducted, and typically when said abduction is in a vehicle. Understandably, sometimes the person they were last seen with has a description like: "Last seen with a 'white' male, 5'9 to 5'11, wearing a beige jacket and blue jeans" - something that is understandably useless, given that that nearly 70% of the USA's (male) population is of pan-European descent and largely of that height (170-). Therefore, it generally boils down to the license plate of the suspected vehicle, which is also included in the AMBER Alert.
</li><li> A common demonstration in psych classes is to have someone come in and "steal" something (usually their own backpack or a planted empty one), or come in, fire a blank gun, then flee, and then have students write as detailed of a description as they can of the suspect and the incident, then bring the suspect back in. Many descriptions will either fail to describe the suspect adequately or actually get things wrong.
</li><li> A police officer, in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DiscoveryChannel">Discovery Channel</a> interview once pointed out that even if the information given by psychics were true, it is never the kind of information that is helpful. They usually say things such as a missing person has "left the city." That isn't useful, without some idea where the person has gone. They may say a murder victim was killed by someone who was very angry, but the anger was misdirected or they spend a lot time claiming to have connected with missing person's emotional state, and say "She is scared, but she knows you are looking for her." That may provide comfort to the family of a missing person, but also provide no end of grief to investigators who need more specific information to narrow down a search area.
</li><li> Exaggerated when Olof Palme (a Swedish prime-minister) was assassinated in 1986 on a public street at night and the police set out to find his killer. Plenty of witnesses were found, but to translate and quote the Swedish Wikipedia article:
<div class="indent">By joining the different witnesses' statements, you can find the following: the murderer was a man, between 175-190 cm tall, who was wearing either a black coat or trenchcoat, and moved in a way that some described as clumsy, limping, "rolling", and others thought was smooth, and who was between 30 and 50 years old.
</div><ul><li> Other sources (of varying credibility) also state that the witnesses described him as wearing about 20 different kinds of hats (while still hatless, mind you), and having a clean-shaved <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PermaStubble">Perma-Stubble</a>, among other contradictions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his murder remains unsolved.
</li></ul></li><li> It is not uncommon for the best-described aspects of a suspect's appearance to be their clothing, something <em>very easy</em> for most suspects to have altered by the time the report is likely to go out. Some may even purposely invoke this (say, wearing a very attention-drawing, easily-discarded hat) to keep attention away from details that actually matter.
</li><li> More than one newspaper has published a police artist's sketch of a suspect wearing a full head ski mask, a blank oval shape with two eye holes.
