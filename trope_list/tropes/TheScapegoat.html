<ul><li> Whether you <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BaseBreakingCharacter">like him or not</a>, every fan of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em> can agree that Shinji Ikari is notoriously this. Anything bad that happens, people usually blame him for it. Touji's sister gets hurt? His fault. Asuka's pissed off? His fault. The most infamous example comes from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/RebuildOfEvangelion">Rebuild of Evangelion</a></em> in which <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Shinji accidentally caused the Third Impact while trying to save Rei, destroying most of the world while he did</span>. No-one who pushed him into fighting take responsibility, and would rather settle for treating him as nastily as possible.
</li><li> Suzaku from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass">Code Geass</a></em> is blamed for the murder of Clovis early on, namely by the Pureblood faction within the army to try and make a case of how Japanese can't be trusted in the military.
<ul><li> A somewhat smaller example at the end of <em>R1</em> onward was when Lelouch met with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodForThisSinfulEarth">Too Good for This Sinful Earth</a> half-sister Euphemia and agreed to back her phased democratization of Japan. An accidental chain of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiabolusExMachina">Diabolus ex Machina</a> brought on by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnalogyBackfire">Analogy Backfire</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">Up to Eleven</a> and random <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence">Power Incontinence</a> causes Euphemia's bodyguard, Lelouch's best friend since childhood, to believe <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">he purposely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape">Mind Rape</a>d her, foisted public blame for a horrifying <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation">False Flag</a> war crime she committed under his influence on her, and then murdered her to take credit for putting an end to it. Lelouch</span> never denied any of these accusations, despite numerous chances to do so.
</li><li> Later on, Schneizel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">uses the above accusation, among others (i. e. not warning them about FLEIJA, something he didn't believe because of Suzaku's apparent betrayal), to turn the Black Knights against their leader</span>.
</li><li> Not to mention the end of the series, where <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nunnally reveals that she worked with Schneizel because she wanted to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillSat">Damocles</a> as the common enemy that would finally unite the whole world peacefully. Lelouch considered doing this, but decided that a mere object wouldn't hold peoples' hatred; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentScapegoat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentScapegoat">a human being, on the other hand</a>...</span>.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallSuper">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>, Goku, who's spoiling for a good fight, reminds <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TopGod">Zen-Oh</a> of his idea to hold a martial arts tournament between all 12 universes. When the rules are announced, it's revealed that the losing universes will be completely erased from existence, which causes people from the other universes to blame Goku for this. However, others point out that he isn't to blame since Zen-Oh wanted to cut down on the number of universes anyway; if anything they should be thanking Goku, since the tournament gives them a fighting chance at survival whereas otherwise Zen-Oh would have just erased them and been done with it.
</li><li> In a filler episode of the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DGrayMan">D.Gray-Man</a></em> anime, Kanda and his seeker come across a town that would isolate someone as a witch and force them to live alone in poor conditions, whenever something unexplainable and bad happened, they would blame it on the witch. This wound up biting them all in the ass when the previous witch (just a child, at that) died alone of illness and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WoobieDestroyerOfWorlds">her sister</a>, driven by hatred and grief, wound up becoming <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeartless">an Akuma</a> and slaughtered the entire village, the seeker outright states <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim">he has trouble feeling sorry over the destruction of a town with such a terrible tradition.</a>
</li><li> Akira from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/EdenOfTheEast">Eden of the East</a></em> eventually ends up taking the fall (sometimes even willingly) for every single thing done by the series' villains, becoming a wanted terrorist in the process.
</li><li> Generals Cremin and Edison in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> are, by the end of the series, the last two survivors of Amestris's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuisling">treasonous</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleInCharge">Central Command</a> and are happily blamed by the heroes for the entire Homunculi conspiracy even though they were actually near the bottom of the evil totem pole. This is because the <em>actual</em> masterminds of the conspiracy included some very well-regarded public figures and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentConspiracy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BenevolentConspiracy">it was considered a better choice</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingTheGuiltyParty">frame the guilty party</a> than risk mass panic.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ASilentVoice">A Silent Voice</a></em>, everyone in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuteMute">Nishimiya's</a> class bullies her relentlessly. However, when the principal finally takes action and asks who was responsible for bullying her, the class immediately and unapologetically places all the blame on one of the main characters, Ishida.

The suspension is actually because Fisk manipulated FBI agents on his payroll to suspend Dex, so that Dex's orderly life will be uprooted and he'll turn to Fisk to give him a sense of purpose. In the midst of swirling in the aftermath of his first mission for Fisk, Dex reaches out to Julie, a woman that he's been stalking. He talks about the FBI are making a scapegoat out of him for the Albanian ambush attack, and makes some hilarious goat-bleating sounds to emphasize this.

Then Low Ki was the scapegoat when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/NewJapanProWrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a>'s sponsors got upset at the fact Low Ki dressed up as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Hitman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/Hitman">Agent 47</a>, who was apparently a trademark of a sponsor's competitor whom they felt New Japan just gave an awesome free commercial to.

</li><li> You could argue that many recipients of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XPacHeat">X-Pac Heat</a> are ultimately scapegoats for WWE management's incompetence. When it comes down to it, the performers answer to management and many don't really have a say in the matter, at least not without getting into hot water with somebody up on the corporate ladder. Since the fans obviously can't boo directly at creative or management besides the McMahons, they boo the performers instead. Take, for example, the 2014 and 2015 Royal Rumble winners.
<ul><li> <strong>2014:</strong> The two people who received the worst of the vitriol were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ReyMysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> and eventual winner <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/Batista">Batista</a>. With Rey, it was because he was the last entrant in the match, and thus it was then that the fans realized runaway crowd-favorite-to-win <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BryanDanielson">Daniel Bryan</a> wasn't going to be in it. With Dave, it was a mishmash of factors  he won when Bryan was left out of it, one week after returning no less, and the fact that he would be winning was completely telegraphed. Many felt he hadn't earned the shot over the current roster after coming back so soon, and the match itself made it clear that he had a severe case of ring rust. Then there's the fact that he returned a face; fans tend to agree that while Batista's face work is above average at best, his heel work is where he really shines and what he clearly enjoys, and the above situation just made it too much of a cognitive dissonance to pan out (he himself admitted in interviews that he didn't want to return as a face but creative kept pushing for it, no doubt to capitalize on <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>). Combined with the fact that he was playing a face who was playing nice with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TheAuthority">The Authority</a>, the most hated faction in the entire company, creating the sense that the Authority were outright manufacturing a controlled main event for WrestleMania, and when it comes down to it, Dave never stood a chance. When he turned heel, the resentment died down and turned into genuine heel heat and everyone was much, much happier, including Dave himself, though that didn't stop him from leaving over <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreativeDifferences">Creative Differences</a> months later.
</li><li> <strong>2015:</strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/RomanReigns">Roman Reigns</a>. Poor, poor, Roman. This time, it was less about him not being Daniel Bryan and more about him being Roman Reigns. Vince is so desperate to find another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/JohnCena">John Cena</a> as the man himself nears forty, and Roman's the one who got stuck with that role, despite being relatively green. It soon became very clear that the character did not fit him. He was eaten <em>alive</em> in the aftermath of the 2015 Royal Rumble, and reactions have been mild even after all the backlash died down during the aftermath of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a></em>. However, Vince is so goddamn stubborn with making him the top face of the company that the fans have been force-fed him for months even though it's very obvious that they don't want to see anymore of him unless he turns heel like Batista did, which is what everyone (including, if the rumors are true, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TripleH">his own son-in-law</a></em>) is telling Vince he needs to do  barring his corporate stooges, that is. He's now the current embodiment of everything fans hate about the WWE and the lightning rod for all the rage people have at Vince's booking decisions. Just like Dave before, he's constantly being set up for failure by Vince and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan">Yes Men</a>, but since he doesn't have the clout Batista has, he's got no choice but to do as he's told. The only thing that actually got him over after ten months of being booked as Cena 2.0 was a genuinely character-motivated berserker rage beating of Triple H  and the McMahons figuring from there that people liked seeing Roman embarrass them (though they've become so hated that embarrassing them would get <em>anyone</em> over). As it turns out, Reigns makes a <em>great</em> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Troll">Troll</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BaronCorbin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/BaronCorbin">Baron Corbin</a> was this when the ratings were plummeting due to creative's awful booking decisions in 2018. Instead of owning up to their own mistakes, the McMahon family all came out and basically blamed Corbin as the reason for said problems. This didn't go over well - any wrestling fan would know this was blatantly false, as Corbin was just doing his job and this was the McMahons' attempt to come out as the heroes of a problem they were responsible for - but the poor bastard was booked to be the guy to take the pay-off of the bad bookings while Vince and his family received no comeuppance.

<div class="indent"><strong>Marge:</strong> Bart, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigNo">nooooo!</a> <br/><strong>Bart:</strong> <em>[standing beside her]</em> What? <br/><strong>Marge:</strong> Sorry, force of habit. Lisa, nooooo!
</div></li><li> "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds"
<ul><li> Lisa, Marge, and Homer wonder who was causing various problems within the house lately (such as tearing up all her test papers, a broken vase, and spreading garbage all over the neighbor's yard before Homer got the chance to, respectively). Bart quips that he was this time innocent of these, and felt they were simply senseless destruction without any of his usual commentary. Turns out, it was the dog, who was continuing his path of destruction even in the room where they were located discussing what's happening.
</li><li> Santa's Little Helper himself was implied to have this same trope applied to him. When they discover some stuff buried underneath the house (specifically, Lisa's bongo drums, Bart's strobe light, and Homer's "best of Ray Stevens featuring 'The Streak'" record) Homer guessed that it was the dog that buried all of their stuff. Marge's response to Homer implies that it was in fact she who buried at least one of the items that Santa's Little Helper uncovered.
</li></ul></li><li> Bart has been expelled from Springfield Elementary School twice, both times for something that he didn't actually do.
</li><li> In "The Seven-Beer Snitch," Fat Tony's Mafia, while they are in prison, deduce that one of their fellow inmates was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInformant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheInformant">The Informant</a>, to which Johnny Tightlips points to Frankie the Squealer as the rat. However, not only does Frankie deny being the rat, but he also reminds him that he's actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoolPigeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoolPigeon">The Stool Pigeon</a>. It was Homer Simpson who was the rat.

<ul><li> Squidward has fallen victim to this on multiple occasions ("Krab Borg", "Can You Spare A Dime?", "The Lost Mattress" and "Keep Bikini Bottom Beautiful", <em>just</em> to name the most popular examples).
</li><li> SpongeBob becomes one in "Life of Crime" when Patrick accuses him of "stealing" his candy bar, when he never really opened his and Patrick ate his in just two bites and was unaware he already finished it up despite SpongeBob trying to tell him so. To add to it, SpongeBob was the one who gave him the bar in the first place.

In the end of the series, Star deems magic as evil and the cause of all the problems in the series. She states that using magic to solve problems only causes more problems, and the ones using it are all idiots who don't deserve the power they have, her own family included. It's better to not have it than let it be abused by the corrupt and stupid anymore. However, even though it's true that abuse of magic is one of the cause of problems, it's not the main cause. Rather, it was the racism between the Mewmans and Monsters and battle over the lands. It's implied that Star is just ignoring the complexity of the situation because she wants a quick solution to stop Mina, so she decides to destroy magic. Moon is also implied to put the blame on magic as well. Moon caused the problem in the finale by foolishly siding with Mina because of her unfair grudge again Eclipsa and her thinking she has control over the situation; that backfired, and Star is understandable angry at her mother. Moon is unsure but agrees to help Star destroy magic, and at the end of the episode tells Star she freed them from the reign of magic, putting the blame for her actions on magic rather than herself.

Leonard once got senselessly blamed and beat up for something Scott did to help him on Valentines Day. When people find out that the cards were fake, the girls beat him up to teach him a lesson. This is one of the many reasons fans hate that episode because they didn't like the main character get senselessly humiliated, blamed, and beat up.

<ul><li> The Christians turned right around and blamed Nero for the fire. Possibly the most successful use of the "no u" defense in history.

</li><li> An actual goat is blamed for the Chicago Cubs' woes - namely, that said goat was ejected from the Wrigley Field stands during Game 4 of the 1945 World Series, which infuriated his owner and proclaimed a curse on the team. The Cubs lost that series and would not play in another World Series until 2016 (which they won).
<ul><li> As far as baseball goes, there is probably <em>no one</em> who has gotten figuratively slaughtered more publicly or mercilessly than Cubs fan Steve Bartman. Just one action of reaching for a foul ball coming your way, something every fan in attendance would do a million times over, means you knock it away from Cubs left fielder Moisés Alou and perhaps prevent him from bringing your beloved Cubs one out closer to ending the curse. Never mind that it was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernieMac" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BernieMac">Bernie Mac</a> who sang "Root, root, root, for <em>the champs</em>" instead of "the Cubbies" during the 7th inning stretch, or that it was still one out in the top of the 8th and the Cubs were still up 3-0, or that Cubs starting pitcher Mark Prior was starting to miss the strike zone after working the entire game, or that, with the Cubs still leading 3-1 later that inning, Cubs shortstop Alex Gonzalez, one of the surest gloves in the game, misplayed a ground ball that would have been an easy inning-ending double play, or that the Cubs were still up 3 games to 2 in the series and could still have won the pennant in Game 7 even if they had lost Game 6. No, as far as all Chicago was concerned, it was <strong>your</strong> fault Alou was angry and acted out and completely changed the mood of all 42,000+ in attendance and 150,000 more in the streets outside; it was <strong>your</strong> fault the Florida Marlins' bats suddenly smacked eight runs across that inning; it was <strong>your fault</strong> the Cubs lost Game 6 AND Game 7 of the series, the latter of which you didn't even attend because everyone around you was throwing "Asshole! Asshole!" chants, food, cups of beer, and <em>death threats</em> in your direction in Game 6. And overnight you became the most (in)famous man in America, your face front and center over every news station from here to Honolulu, your home being protected by a line of cops to stop the ravenous media from bothering you and irate fans from chucking rocks at your windows, your city inflamed with expressions of rage and hatred of your mere existence. And now you can never again go to the hitherto Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field to watch your favorite team or show your face in public lest some fan decides to slug your teeth in, at least not until the Cubs finally break this curse. And all because you reached for a foul ball. In July 2017, Cubs owner Tom Ricketts sent Bartman an official World Series Championship ring as an apology for the hardships he had to endure.
</li></ul></li><li> Before Bartman, there was Bill Buckner. Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, Red Sox were up 3 games to 2 in the series and held a 5-3 lead with two outs in the bottom of the 10th inning with bases empty. One more out, and the Red Sox win their first World Series since 1918. Everyone recalls the ending as Buckner letting a slow ground ball up the first base line between his legs which let the winning run for the Mets score, and the Mets also winning Game 7. Fewer will remember that Buckner's error was just the last in a series of plays that allowed that situation to come up in the first place: a Gary Carter single, a Kevin Mitchell single on an 0-2 count<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1aw7l');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1aw7l" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1aw7l');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">no balls, two strikes - one more strike and the Red Sox win</span>, a Ray Knight single that scored Carter (now 5-4 Red Sox) and got Mitchell to third base, Red Sox closer Calvin Schiraldi (who was working his third inning - it's rare for closers to pitch more than one in a game) being pulled for Bob Stanley, Stanley being worked to a 2-2 count on Mookie Wilson before Stanley threw a wild pitch near Wilson's feet which rolled to the backstop and let Mitchell score the tying run. This was all before Wilson tapped the grounder to Buckner (in other words, the Red Sox's lead was already blown by the time Buckner committed the error). Nonetheless, sports radio and Red Sox fans remembered Buckner as the guy responsible for the Red Sox losing in '86, and after retiring in 1990 he didn't appear at Fenway until 2008 (<em>after</em> the Red Sox had won the World Series in '04 and '07). Buckner's career was quite impressive - 2,715 hits (more than Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio), .289 batting average, 1,208 runs batted in - but anytime his name is mentioned among baseball fans, this one error will be the first thing that comes to mind.
</li><li> This happens very often in baseball. Tony Fernández was shaping up to be a potential MVP for the 1997 World Series for the Cleveland Indians. Then, in the 11th inning of Game 7, Bobby Bonilla of the Florida Marlins shielded him on a soft grounder by Craig Counsell, and Fernández ended up doing his best Bill Buckner impression. The Marlins won it all three batters later.
<div class="indent"><strong>Bob Costas:</strong> Tony Fernández, who has worn hero's laurels throughout the postseason, including earlier in this seventh game of the World Seriesnow, cruel as it may seem, perhaps being fitted for goat horns.
</div><ul><li> Fortunately for him, most of the heat for the loss ended up falling on Jose Mesa, who blew the save in the bottom of the 9th.
</li></ul></li><li> Similar to Bartman, Michael Beason, a Charlotte Hornets fan who sat courtside and loved to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrashTalk">Trash Talk</a> Charlotte's adversaries, became infamous during the 2016 playoffs against the Miami Heat, wearing a distinctive shirt that earned the nickname <a class="urllink" href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nba/charlotte-hornets/article74879247.html">"Purple Shirt Guy\Man"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

Charlotte then had to fly to Miami and lost game 7.

</li><li> The President of the United States might as well be changed to "The Scapegoat of the United States". No matter <em>what</em> happens, it will somehow be blamed on the President. Riot related to a football team losing? President's fault. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VocalMinority">Vocal Minority</a> Muslim terrorist tries to blow something up? The President did it. Avalanche in the Rocky Mountains? President did it.
<ul><li> It's often been said that the single best indicator for whether or not a sitting President will win reelection is the state of the economy. Something the President has very limited ability to influence. And essentially no ability to influence in the areas of the economy that an average American is likely to personally experience, like the price of gasoline or food (the former often being a driver of presidential approval ratings).
</li><li> America in general. Even on this very wiki.

</li></ul></li><li> This has often been parodied on comments on news, where when something happens, someone jokingly comments "Obama/Bush did it". It's also echoed in the now-memetic line "Thanks, Obama!" in which <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BarackObama">Barack Obama</a> gets blamed for literally <em>everything</em>. Including things that happened before he was the President or even <em>born yet</em>. <em>Especially</em> things that happened before he was the President or even born yet. For instance, it's frequent to blame Obama for 9/11.
<ul><li> "Thanks, Obama" mostly died when Trump was elected, for obvious reasons, but Obama still gets scapegoated seriously occasionally.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Whoever the person in charge of a country is. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom's title should be changed to "Prime Scapegoat of the United Kingdom", just like the U.S. President. However it's worth noting the Prime Minster is also the leader of their party and domestically have more power than the president. They select whoever they want for the cabinet and have considerable individual sway over legislation and policy. But with more power comes more blame if it all goes south. That said every PM gets to use "the previous government" as a scapegoat, at least for the short term.
</li><li> Dictators with a very bad image are often used as scapegoats, and few people will bother to defend them from blatantly false accusations as it will simply be assumed that they did so many bad things that one more on the list is plausible.
</li><li> Apple Inc. and Microsoft have Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, respectively. They supposedly do all of the research, all of the marketing, all of the designs, and receive all of the criticism.
</li><li> You yourself probably know a scapegoat. You know, that person who everyone always seems to actively seek out and take it all out on? One can easily wonder if there's a personality disorder that practically requires someone to have a scapegoat in their life - Dave Pelzer and then his brother Richie, for example, were scapegoats to their mother's wrath.
<ul><li> Clinical psychologists actually have a term for this when dealing with dysfunctional families: the "identified patient". Sometimes in a family where at least one parent is alcoholic, abusive, or mentally ill, one child gets designated as the scapegoat and the rest of the family is encouraged to blame that child for all their problems. That child is often the first one to get into therapy, and the first to face up to all of the family's problems, because the rest of the family is in denial about the real issues that are causing so much suffering. Without the scapegoat, a dysfunctional family is forced to deal with their own problems, which they are often unwilling to do.
</li></ul></li><li> The entertainment industry, particularly video games, typically take some amount of undeserved blame any time a mass shooting occurs. Thanks a lot, Jack Thompson.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight">Not Always Right</a> has quite a few examples; people will look for ways to pin anything on anyone so long as it's not their own fault.
</li><li> After the Germans attacked the Soviet Union, Stalin executed many of the commanding generals on the western border. It is still argued how much of the fault was actually theirs, but a notable case is where they executed the chief veterinarian and the head of the warehouses, but an army commander was spared and later promoted - because the communications with him were lost at the time.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheHouseOfTudor">Queen Elizabeth I</a> blamed her advisers for 'tricking' her into signing the order of execution for her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots. Whether this was actually the case, no one will ever know.
<ul><li> Of course, the Tudors were great at assigning scapegoats. Nothing was ever the fault of Elizabeth's father Henry VIII either, especially not his inability to sire healthy male offspring. Lucky for him no one had any knowledge of cellular biology at the time and thus it was impossible to be aware that the father always determines the offspring's gender.
</li></ul></li><li> Emancipated blacks were this for the dominant whites up to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CivilRightsMovement">Civil Rights Movement</a> (and even then, such incidents like these can be depressingly common in low income areas now).
</li><li> People accused of witchcraft were often accused of doing something which often occurs naturally like a bad/ruined crop, babies dying, widespread illness, ect.
</li><li> Hideki Tojo, who was Prime Minister of Japan for all but the final few months of its participation in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a>, volunteered to be the scapegoat for all of the country's war crimes, so that Emperor Hirohito would keep his position and be cleared of anything he may have taken part in during the war. In this case, Tojo was clearly guilty of more than enough war crimes in his own right to be all but guaranteed the death penalty, and figured he might as well <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakingTheBullet">take Hirohito's bullets</a> as well as his own, so that the country wouldn't be left rudderless in the aftermath of the war.
</li><li> The well-known <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayanDoomsday" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayanDoomsday">Mayan Doomsday</a> was a bunch of apocalypse theories that had to do with the Mayan Calendar "ending" in December 21, 2012. However, many people believe that it's the Mayans who believed that the Apocalypse was happening, while it was actually the theorists who believed the Apocalypse was going to happen. In fact, Mayans believed that the calendar would reset like any other calendar.
</li><li> Atlanta security guard Richard Jewell was the man who found a backpack full of explosives during the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, thus saving what could have been potentially thousands of lives. At first he was hailed as a hero... but then an FBI agent leaked the fact that they (the FBI) were checking into Jewell just in case. (This is a standard law enforcement procedure.) The Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper turned "We're checking into him just in case" into "He's our number one suspect", and the public crucifixion of Richard Jewell began. He was finally exonerated in 2005, nearly ten years later, when terrorist Eric Rudolph confessed that it was he who planted the explosives and not Jewell.
</li><li> There is the anecdote, told by Francisco Herrera Luque in his book "<em>Bovez el urogallo</em>", about a rich woman in colonial Venezuela, that has the misfortune of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gasshole" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gasshole">having a bad case of loud intestinal gases</a>, which embarrassed her on church and other social situations. The solution her family come with? Put a young slave girl as a constant companion of the lady, so when the master farted the poor girl was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisBlamed">Mis-blamed</a> and received a bump in the head or a fan hit, and received the nickname of "la pagapeos, lit. "the one who pays for the farts"". To this day, the term "pagapeos" is more or less equivalent of "scapegoat" in Venezuela.
</li><li> Some conspiracy theorists believe the car accident that took Gunpei Yokoi's life was actually caused by an assassin hired by Nintendo. Heaven knows why, because even though this <em>was</em> shortly after he left Nintendo (disgraced after the high-profile failure that was the Virtual Boy) to work on the WonderSwan, Nintendo still holds respect for the man.
</li><li> Many times a player might be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Misblamed">Misblamed</a> into the cause of a huge defeat, the so-called "Quarterback Syndrome". Though at least once the scapegoat earned it: in 2010, Brazil's Felipe Melo crowned a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/FIFAWorldCup">FIFA World Cup</a> of irregular play and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnnecessaryRoughness">Unnecessary Roughness</a> by scoring an own goal and being expelled due to <em><a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6H-qaDxmO4">taking down an adversary and stomping on his leg<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> in his team's elimination game to the Netherlands. His career barely recovered ever since.
</li><li> Captive packs of wolves have been known do this. Either a single wolf or (less commonly) two or a small group of them, called omegas, are singled out to take the brunt of just about everything. They will be attacked for anything from trying to stand up for themselves or if their packmates are just upset, and in some cases may be killed or driven out of the pack. In a twist, the omega wolves are often as important to the pack as the alpha pair. Their presence acts as a sort of lightening rod to absorb tension and keeps the pack from turning on each other, sort of like taking your aggression out on a punching bag. Because captive packs were the first ones studied, it was assumed for decades wild wolves are the exact same way, with terminology being developed for it (alpha, beta, omega), but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">later research</a> has shown that in the wild, wolves usually do not behave this way. The reason for the difference is probably housing unrelated wolves together, as wolves in the wild usually will not tolerate unrelated wolves joining their pack, and possibly stress from improper care in captivity is a factor as well.
<ul><li> <a class="urllink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTdaWUDeGsg">Here<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> is (upsetting to some) video showing the behavior. The cause is obviously that there are far, far too many stressed wolves crammed together in a small enclosure in this bad zoo.
</li></ul></li><li> The Vestal Virgins of Ancient Rome were often blamed when things weren't going well. It was insinuated that someone among them <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlutShaming">had taken a lover or two</a> (a big no-no as they were sworn to celibacy until their term of service was up or they died, whichever came first), or that they had allowed the fire in the Temple of Vesta to go out.

The Soviet Union even tried to condemn Germany for the Katyn Massacre during the Nuremberg Trials in 1945 (it didn't work). Records released after <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatPoliticsMessUp">the Soviet Union collapsed</a> eventually revealed that, for once, Germany was innocent of that war crime, and it was in fact the Soviets who did it.
</li><li> LaDondrell Montgomery had his life sentence for armed robbery cancelled when it emerged he was <em>in prison</em> when the stick-up happened.
</li><li> Shortly before the trial of James "Whitey" Bulger was set to start a potential witness named Stephen Rakes was found dead in the woods near his home. Due to the timing it was initially theorized it had something to do with his testimony, but when asked about it Whitey pointedly said he had nothing to do with it, and it turns out he was telling the truth: Rakes was killed by a business associate for reasons completely unrelated to the trial.
</li><li> After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the two officers in charge of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and defense of Hawaii, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short, were scapegoated by their superiors. Kimmel in particular argued that he had not been provided with enough intelligence regarding Japanese intentions prior to the attack and that most of the poor decisions that lead to the debacle had been result of his direct predecessor, Admiral Harold Stark. Stark later faced a court of inquiry into his actions which resulted in his removal from command, but Kimmel's name is still one most associated with the attack. In 1999, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution saying that both were scapegoated and called for their posthumous return to full rank, but the Navy and subsequent Presidents have never taken it up.
</li><li> Independent pro wrestler Brian Blaze was scapegoated in 2014 and incarcerated in the place of a criminal the police could not catch that he apparently <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalDoppelganger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriminalDoppelganger">resembled closely enough</a>. There was a great outcry among the pro wrestling fans of Georgia, wrestlers and at least PCW's promoter, who together successfully proved his innocence...after Blaze had been in jail for five months, but the response outside of the pro wrestling community was barely heard, which may have been why the police and courts thought they could get away with it.(to his credit, the officer who arrested Brian said he was just following orders and offered to testify in court for Brian)
</li><li> The Treaty of Versailles, the treaty that ended World War One, was written entirely by the allies and blamed Germany for the entire war. Despite the fact that Germany was only in the war in the first place because its ally Austria-Hungary (which had broken up into Austria and Hungary) was. Italy was exempt from any blame because it switched sides close to the end of the war. Germany was saddled with the bill for all of the damage in the war, which thanks to being stripped of its colonies <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGreatDepression">(and it being the 1930's)</a> it could never hope to repay. In hindsight, it's really no surprise that the Nazis were able to entice the country with promises of a better future.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a></em>s biggest <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DorkAge">Dork Age</a> is near universally agreed to be the sixths doctor tenure, which suffered from horrible, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy">mean spirited</a> writing, the Doctor terrible decisions being made across the board (such as The Doctors <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyTackyClothes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImpossiblyTackyClothes">infamous coat</a> and devoting an entire season to a dull, frustrating Trial of a Time Lord <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FramingDevice">Framing Device</a> that went nowhere) and production values that were bad even for <em>Doctor Who</em>. What <em>isnt</em> to blame is the lead actor <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinBaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ColinBaker">Colin Baker</a>, who was a solid actor and well cast in the role - so naturally, he was the one who got blamed for the shows failings at the time, and got fired by the BBC, with a regeneration sequence being filmed by having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SylvesterMcCoy">Sylvester McCoy</a> face down on the floor with a wig on. (McCoys era would start off only marginally better, but eventually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">grow the beard</a> and allow the classic era to go out on a high note - one wonders what wouldve happened if Baker was allowed to stay on.)
</li><li> The Great Chicago fire started as a smaller blaze in Catherine O'Leary's barn, and then dry windy conditions combined with terribly unsafe building practices to burn the city to the ground. The popular press at the time then tried to pin the entire disaster on poor Kate. In popular culture the fire still gets blamed on "Mrs. O'Leary's cow".

Edited clips from Braceface, Ep 12 - Driving Miss Sharon. Feeling inadequate due to Adam getting his license, Sharon takes her mom's car for a spin when her braces inadvertingly activate the engine. However on the way back the house, she gets into an accident and before she has the chance to fess up, Adam is blamed by their mother since, well, who else could drive her car? </p>
