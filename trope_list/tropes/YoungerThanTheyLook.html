<ul><li> It is revealed that Maria in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HayateTheCombatButler">Hayate the Combat Butler</a></em> is only 17, but she is incredibly mature and everybody mistakes her for a beautiful woman in her mid-to-late-20s, leading Hayate to believe that he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikesOlderWomen">Likes Older Women</a>. It also becomes a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag">Running Gag</a> that Maria is irritated when people mention "young girls" as if she doesn't fit into that group. Specifically, she keeps saying "I'm 17-years-old" with increasing irritation. It's also a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut">Shout-Out</a> to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KikukoInoue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KikukoInoue">Kikuko Inoue</a>.
</li><li> Halflings in general in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeliciousInDungeon">Delicious in Dungeon</a></em>. They lack the stout proportions of dwarves and gnomes, which, paired with their short stature and baby-faced features, makes most of them look like human tweens at the oldest. The only exception seems to be a few older or unhealthier individuals, who tend to take on sort of a gaunt, Smeagol-ish appearance. This gets used as a joke when Chilchuck, whom the group had previously assumed to be very young, reveals that he's actually in his late-twenties, long married, and has children old enough to leave the house.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MermaidMelodyPichiPichiPitch">Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch</a></em> has Seira, a baby that looks and acts about ten.
</li><li> Downplayed in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/BubblegumCrisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a></em>: given how long ago sexaroids were labeled as illegal by the series start, we get the implication that while Sylvie and Anri may not be as old as they look (Sylvie appears in her mid-twenties while Anri looks to be the loli model), they're not single digit ages.
</li><li> Yagi Yuria in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shibatora" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Shibatora">Shibatora</a></em> works at a maid cafe, passing as over eighteen, but is really only twelve years old. The fact that her mental maturity is normal for her real age, not her appearance, results in her being exploited by a number of other characters.
</li><li> Zelgadis the chimera of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Slayers">Slayers</a></em> is 20 at the start of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightNovels">Light Novel</a> series, and his appearance appropriately matches his age. In the anime though, his age is bumped down to sixteen (a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> statement in a film book), making him fall under this trope. It doesn't help that his voice is noticeably deep, especially in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CrispinFreeman">the English version.</a> More often than not, Gourry (who's older and taller than Zelgadiss is; in the anime, he's the only protagonist who starts out in his twenties) is referred to as a <em>boy.</em>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga">Excel Saga</a></em>, a paedophile takes a nine-year-old to a love hotel, only to learn that she's, er, "prodigious."<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note0fdfw');"><sup>* </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note0fdfw" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note0fdfw');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">She was able to completely hide away her triple-g cup breasts.</span> The episode in question was making as many jokes that couldn't be aired on TV as possible (it didn't, which was what the creators wanted), but everything was still played for laughs (all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackComedy">black laughs</a>), which meant the paedophile <em>left</em> the underaged girl broken-hearted when he saw what she looked like, before anything awful happened. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WidgetSeries">Yep.</a>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/IrresponsibleCaptainTylor">Irresponsible Captain Tylor</a></em>:
<ul><li> Harumi appears to be in her mid-twenties, but viewers who have a quick enough eye to catch her character stats just before the commercial breaks will be surprised to realize that she's only <em>3 years old</em>. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">It turns out that she's an android, so don't worry too much about it.</span>
</li><li> A more mundane example in the same show would be Dr. Kitaguchi, a 33 year-old doctor who looks like he's somewhere in his 50s. If his self-proclaimed thirty-year drinking habit isn't an exaggeration, you can probably figure out why.

<ul><li> Yuki Nagato and her associates appear to be about fifteen, but <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as constructs of the Data Overmind, their physical bodies at least are only up to three</span> years old. It's somewhat debatable since it isn't known how the whole system works, but with <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Nagato getting trapped in a time loop for hundreds of years (and mentally aging, as she alone retains full memories of the repetitions)</span> the fifth novel <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">inverts this and makes her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld">Really 700 Years Old</a></span>. An alternate theory mentioned in the show is that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the whole universe was recreated three years earlier, so <em>everyone</em> who thinks they're older than three is actually <em>Younger Than They Look</em></span>.
</li><li> Kyon's sister's friend Miyoko is this. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> She is the same age as his elementary school aged sister but appears to be within a year of Kyon's age.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Yoko in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TengenToppaGurrenLagann">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann</a></em> is actually 14, the same age as Simon. However, since humans had been living underground for generations, without a sun or anything, they probably couldn't tell time as accurately, so who knows. Although, supplementary material, such as the official anime guide, states that she is actually 18.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Planetes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Planetes">Planetes</a></em>, a minor character is twelve years old, but since she grew up on the Moon with it's lower gravity, her growth rate was accelerated and her size makes her look like she's in her early twenties. This causes the twenty-something main character to be <em>really</em> uncomfortable when he discovers her true age... especially since it appeared he'd been developing something of a crush on her.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BludgeoningAngelDokurochan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/BludgeoningAngelDokurochan">Bludgeoning Angel Dokurochan</a></em>, the title character has a nine-year-old sister that looks about nine years older than her.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MahouSenseiNegima">Mahou Sensei Negima!</a></em>:

One of them gets so mad, she uses magic age-reducing pills to turn herself into a small child, until she realizes (too late) that the cost of the pills combined with the ticket come out to more than she would have had to pay normally. The other, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ninja">Ninja</a>, just <em>Henges</em> herself younger for free.

His actual age? <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> <em>17</em>. Yes, he's <em>younger</em> than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">her</a>.</span>

It becomes real scary considering all the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeensAreMonsters">horrible things</a> he's done</span>
</li></ul></li><li> Jet of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</a></em> looks like he could be in his forties or fifties, but is only thirty-six. This is lampshaded in the preview for "Waltz for Venus" where he tells us this, and says you shouldn't judge people by how they look, or how much hair they have.
</li><li> Much of the cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Eyeshield21">Eyeshield 21</a></em> qualifies:
<ul><li> The one that takes the cake is Rikiya Gaoh: He's two meters tall (6'7"), square-jawed, musclebound, capable of bench-pressing over 200 kg (over 440 lb)...and we're supposed to believe that he's a high school freshman. Some of the other characters <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">don't believe it either</a> ("There oughta be a law against players like him!").
</li><li> That's not even getting into Atsushi Munakata of the Amino Cyborgs, whose tremendous musculature and broad, dashingly handsome face make him look over <em>30</em>, a fact that is actually commented upon. One Omake chapter shows that he actually looks exactly like his father... <em>and</em> his mother.
</li><li> Lampshaded when Sena and Monta discover the identity of Musashi, who they only knew as <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">the middle-aged looking construction guy who worked on their ever expanding clubhouse</span>. They cry out in unison "You're seventeen??!!"
</li><li> Similar to Musashi, Yamabushi from Shinryuuji looks much older than he is due to his half-grown in beard. He's even charged with pumping up the Japanese youth cup team before the game against America because he looks the oldest. When he gets too emotional, the similarly adult-looking Mamoru Banba steps in to offer his own uplifting words.
</li><li> Mr. Don, Gaoh's opponent in the American game, is supposed to be 18, but looks closer to sixty with his white hair, massive stature, and heavily-wrinkled face.
</li><li> Lampshaded in a chapter where we learn they even have rankings for who has the worst case of "old man" face.

<ul><li> You would never, ever know it by looking at him or hearing him talk, but Piccolo at the beginning is chronologically only eight years old. Nobody remembers this, for good reason. When he was born he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon">was supposed to be a demon</a>. He actually takes much longer to reach maturity than Piccolo Daimaou's other "offspring", who are full-grown when they hatch.
<ul><li> Especially amusing in retrospect when he's teaching Gohan whose only a couple years younger than him at four years old.
</li></ul></li><li> In a similar vein, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LegoGenetics">Cell</a> is much, much younger than you'd expect - even with all the time-traveling he had to do to reach a timeline where he could absorb the Androids, he's still only in his early twenties.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/DragonBallGT">Dragon Ball GT</a></em>, there is an extreme case of this in the Shadow Dragons, who, though mature as any other <em>Dragon Ball</em> villains, are, by technicality, newborns, spawned from the Dragon Balls' misuse.
</li><li> <em>GT</em> also gives us Bra/Bulla, who's only 11 but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeInappropriateDress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgeInappropriateDress">wears revealing clothing</a> and looks a few years older — to the point where grown men hit on her.

For contrast Corkus is a year older than Pippin despite looking <a class="urllink" href="https://www.nautiljon.com/images/perso/00/83/corkus_4738.jpg">younger,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> though the movie adaptions make Corkus look closer to his age.

(Admittedly, he regularly <em>acts</em> that age, too.) This is repeatedly lampshaded with people who get it wrong; his brother is in junior high but looks far more grownup than his brother (and, again, acts the part too...); when they go to the movies, they buy each other's tickets to avoid lengthy explanations.
</li><li> While Satella of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ChronoCrusade">Chrono Crusade</a></em> looks somewhere around her late twenties or early thirties, she turns out to only be nineteen years old much to the surprise of Rosette.

They even call him "Oyaji" (i.e. "Geezer" or "Pops").
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SlamDunk">Slam Dunk</a></em>, Shinichi Maki, the captain of Kainan team, looks like he was over 35 but he is only 17. After learning it, Hanamichi immediately nicknames him "Middle-aged Man" and never calls him by his real name. Maki retaliates by pointing out that Akagi, Shohoku's captain, looks even <em>older</em>. And later on in the series, Uozumi (whose the same age as Akagi), is mistaken for Akagi's father.

</li><li> Arf is another example. She looks to be in her mid-twenties or so, but in reality is probably only three or four years old tops considering Fate created her, and Fate herself is another example as a clone with a copy of the memories from the girl she was cloned from.
</li><li> By extension, this trope applies to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Erio and Zest</span> for the same reasons as Fate.
</li><li> Sette looks like an adult woman, but is the last of the Numbers to have been activated, and thus younger than any of the others (particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenMiniMoe">Cinque</a>, who is a direct inverse: looks like a kid, has the mind and skills of a seasoned commando).

</li><li> The silpelits from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> age at about double the rate of normal humans.

However, she uses a powerful genjutsu round the clock to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VainSorceress">make herself look like a twenty-year-old</a> (or however old she needs to be to escape her creditors.) <em>However</em>, her most powerful jutsu of her own invention heals any wound she may receive, but at the cost of aging her far faster than her contemporaries. So without the genjutsu, she <em>is</em> younger than she looks. (whew!)
</li><li> Teuchi, the ramen shop owner, appears to be in his 60s at best but is only 43 at the beginning of the manga.
</li><li> It's implied Kakashi was 6 when he became a genin but he looked indistinguishable from even the current cast, who were 12 when they became genin, Kakashi keeps this trope going as adult he looks like he's in 30s with his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalWhiteHair" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysticalWhiteHair">white hair</a> but is only 26 when Naruto was genin.

</li><li> Another <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialHuman">Artificial Human</a> example of this trope is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Onmyodo">Abe no Yasuaki</a> of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarukanaruTokiNoNakaDe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HarukanaruTokiNoNakaDe">Harukanaru Toki no Naka de</a></em>. The manga mentions that Abe no Seimei created him two years prior to the start of the story; Yasuaki's <em>official</em> age is 21.
</li><li> Isabella from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ParadiseKiss" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ParadiseKiss">Paradise Kiss</a></em> is high school age, but dressing like a middle-aged Victorian lady makes her look remarkably older. Her very mature and composed attitude only add to it, as do her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transgender">knobbly, slightly manly hands</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoromatic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Mahoromatic">Mahoromatic</a></em>, being about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RidiculouslyHumanRobots">androids</a>, has an alien android who poses as a school teacher. When asked over the course of the series about age-related issues, such as if he would go drinking with a group of other teachers, he always replies, " That would be illegal, as I am only three years old." <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdnessCensor">For some reason, nobody bothers to question him on this</a>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/OnePiece">One Piece</a></em>:
<ul><li> This trope applies to Zoro and Sanji at the start of the series, who thanks to appearance, personality and being voiced by older male voice actors; seem much more older and mature than their actual ages of 19. It's especially amusing as Zoro <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAlcoholic">The Alcoholic</a> wasn't even old enough to drink at the time (legal drinking age is 20 in Japan). Sanji seemed older to some fans (probably because he smokes), as in a SBS they questioned Oda about Sanji's offical age thinking he was lying; leading Oda to say they have to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeOurWordForIt">take his word for it</a>.
</li><li> Vivi as Miss Wednesday looks like <a class="urllink" href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/the-kennel/images/a/a0/Vivi_Evil.png/revision/latest?cb=20130526022907">she's in her 20s<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, so may come as a shock to learn she was only <em>16</em> at the time. This may be part of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyRoyaltyReveal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyRoyaltyReveal">Really Royalty Reveal</a> as she even has a different voice actor when disguised. After dropping the disguise, she is drawn looking more closer to her actual age; though she's still as bosomy as Nami so this trope is still in effect.
</li><li> Kaku is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse">In-Universe</a> example as he speaks like an old man, leading to Usopp and Nami questioning his age. Kaku answers that he's 23, only a couple of years older than them. Rob Lucci is also a good example, as he <a class="urllink" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11111/111114160/4635637-cp9_infobox.jpg">looks as old as Jabra<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> (who's 35) but is actually 28, he just seems older due to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoic">extreme seriousness</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sadist">brutality</a>.
<ul><li> Ditto for Kalifa: she's drawn looking more mature and older than Nami, though she's only 6 years older (at 25 years old) and is younger than Robin (who was 28 <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">at the time</a>).
</li></ul></li><li> Mermaid Princess Shirahoshi is in the same boat as Vivi: despite having the upper body of a grown woman she's only 16. For additional irony, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWoman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantWoman">she's massive as well</a>. Though it's also worth mentioning Shirahoshi acts like she's even younger, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProneToTears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProneToTears">crying frequently</a> and whining, due to her mother's death and her sheltered upbringing.

Pretty ridiculous when she looks the same age as her aunt Viola whose freaking 29.
</li><li> Pudding, the 35th daughter of Big Mom. She's as curvaceous as Nami, but the introduction of her younger sister (who's 15) threw her age into question. This was corrected on the day of the chapter's release by Oda's staff on Twitter and on a later chapter, but even with the correction Pudding can't be any older than 16 or 17. This would've made her relationship with Sanji a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MayDecemberRomance">MayDecember Romance</a> had it actually happened (but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShipSinking">it didn't</a>).

Amusingly, her mother actually <em>works</em> at a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosplayCafe" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CosplayCafe">Cosplay Café</a> and was mistaken for Taeko's friend when she turned up in her work uniform. <strong>The combination of the two tropes lead to Taeko looking older than her mother.</strong>
</li><li> Ling Yao of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist">Fullmetal Alchemist</a></em> is a mild case. He's 15, but he looks like a fully-grown adult. This is used for both a joke about him being much taller than <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNapoleon">Ed</a> (who is slightly older) and a plot point when he's arrested as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIllegal" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheIllegal">an illegal immigrant</a> and the authorities don't believe he's really a minor.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HibikisMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HibikisMagic">Hibiki's Magic</a></em> has Asuma, a wizard who ages much more quickly than normal as a price for using magic. In reality, he's probably at least in his late teens, but he looks to be about in his late 20s/early 30s.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a></em>, it's implied that Rei is in fact a 4-year-old with the mind of a 14-year-old <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">as a result of being a clone</span>. On the other hand, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">there's no evidence the clones haven't been growing at a normal, human rate, so physically they could all be 14</span>.

<ul><li> Shogo Kawada should only be around a year older than his fifteen-year-old classmates but he looks much older due to his muscular physique, long facial scar and thick stubble as well as his mature demeanor. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Possibly a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope">Justified Trope</a> as he was forced to mature quickly in his first entry into the programme and his childhood helping his father in .</span>.

You know, this red-haired guy who's smoking all the time and is about <em>two meters</em> tall. Believe it or not, he's just <em>14</em>. This is actually a result of a miscommunication between the writer and the artist. The writer said that Stiyl's battle with Touma was meant to be "old vs new" meaning magic vs science. The artist read that, missed the note after about Stiyl's age, misinterpreted it to mean "old man vs young man" and drew Stiyl as a man in his 30s.

In an early panel where he's perving on Keiko his face is labelled, 'fourteen years old.' I.e., in his last year of middle school.

</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KillLaKill">Kill la Kill</a></em> - despite being a high-school senior, Ira Gamagoori doesn't look like he could realistically be in his teens... Because he <em>isn't</em>. It turns out that he deliberately put off leaving middle school for a couple of years so that he could be in the same year as (and thus serve under) Satsuki. He's not <em>that</em> old though. He explains he's turning 20 of that year. Meaning he's 19 during the series proper, basically in his late teens.

</div></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sankarea" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sankarea">Sankarea</a></em>, Darin looks to be somewhere in her mid-20s to early 30s, but eventually lets slip that she's actually only 14. The other characters are so dumbfounded by this that they focus more on the fact that they're actually older than her than anything important she's telling them. Her older appearance was likely intentional on her part, but even after she relaxes her "mature" look somewhat, it's still very rare for her to actually look 14.
</li><li> Toge Sohei from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Adolf" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Adolf">Adolf</a></em> is 28, but looks like he's in his forties. He even has grey hair in the colour illustrations.

He's a very tall kid who towers over even many, if not most, adult characters and looks like a lanky teenager. His parents expect him to act like an adult which upsets him because, despite his appearance, he's emotionally and physically still just a kid.
</li><li> <em>Hatsukoi Monster</em> gives us Kanade Takahashi, a fifth-grader with the body of a 17 year-old. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticComedy">Given the series' genre,</a> the heroine finds it awkward to be dating him.

Subverted, as this is implied to be them lying about their age, as other material suggests Jessie is 25. While some semi-official English sources back in the day placed them around 17, the original is explicit about them approaching 25. Jessie's rage button about being called an old hag/<em>oban</em> is because she nearly is one, her mother Miyamoto laments it in her recordings (snippets of Miyamoto's ramblings while lost in the Andes mountains at the start of each chapter, talking about her daughter she couldn't watch grow up, provide us with clues as to when each part of Mewtwo's origin story takes place). This is also the reason for her obsession with getting married and settling down as soon as possible. By <em>Diamond &amp; Pearl</em>, James also looks visibly pained when a little boy calls him ojisan (implying he's an old man).

Jaeha too seems to deem him as the second adult in the manga's main cast, as he's the only character Jaeha doesn't use the "-kun" honorific to address him with—and that includes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook">Kija</a>, who's a good 2 years older than Hak is. 15-year-old Yun <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades">Lampshades</a> it at one point, admitting that he honestly forgot Hak was younger than Kija.

It's a weird case because Bounts can live forever as long as they have souls to devour, but despite Sawatari looking like a very old man he's relatively young for a Bount. He looks so old because he ate <em>too many</em> souls when he was younger, which caused his body to age at an accelerated pace.

The first big example is Jotaro Kujo in Part 3 does <em>not</em> look like he's 17 (in fact, he seems to look <em>younger</em> in Part 4 and even more in Part 6). The same applies to a lesser extent to Josuke Higashikata and Okuyasu Nijimura in Part 4, and then you have Giorno Giovanna and Trish Una. You'd think they'd be both adults, considering they both look as old as the more experienced members in Passione. Nope, they're both 15, and the one person on the team who actually looks like a teenager, Narancia Ghirga, is <em>two years older than them</em>. There's also Lucy Steel from Part 7, who, despite her height and figure, is only 14 years old.

It's further complicated by the white wig he wears through the entire rest of <em>Curse of the Black Pearl</em> as part of his formal naval uniform. Averted in the sequel, <em>Dead Man's Chest</em>, where he has fallen from grace and his real (brown) hair has outgrown the wig, making him look his actual age.

According to the official timeline, Anakin was 45 at this point.

</li><li> In Episode III, the soon-to-be-Emperor Palpatine ages to about 110 in a matter of seconds (he was really 63).

<ul><li> A German joke, sometimes attributed to Heinz Rudolf Kunze: "A few minutes later he straightened with agonizing effort again and lurched to the sink in the corner. He stared at a hideous goblin with spotty face and strands of hair stuck in dried vomit; his emaciated bones stood out of the skin hanging down in flabby flaps; his stomach was bloated, his legs were crooked and arthritic, the face of one beaten poor devil at the end of a long and lonely ride...

The story takes place in medieval France. 40 was considered pretty old, so to be bald at 36 is not unreasonable. (And even today, many men go bald in their mid-twenties.) There's also the medieval Catholic custom of "taking the tonsure," which meant that members of the clergy shaved a circle on top of their head that coincidentally resembled male-pattern baldness.

It was also done to separate her from young and supposedly innocent characters, like Laura, and to emphasize that she isn't to be sexualized in any way, as much of the symbolism in the game places emphasis on sexuality.

</li><li> Mercenary and potential companion MacCready, who appeared as the twelve-year old Mayor of Little Lamplight in <em>Fallout 3</em>, also looks older than his <em>Fallout 4</em> age of twenty-two, but his aging isn't as egregious as Maxson's.
</li><li> Most ghouls have been around for hundreds of years, many since before the Great War. Hancock, on the other hand, has only been a ghoul for about ten years, following the mother of all bad drug trips. In truth, he's probably around 60 at most.

Homer then laughs at him and reveals that he's 36 years old (though later episodes have him as 38 or 39, depending) and 239 pounds, which disturbs the mind reader. If one were to go by the chronological saying that Marge and Homer had become parents shortly after graduating high school, both would only be 28 years old (the episode "I Married Marge" establishes Homer's age at the time of Bart's birth — or at least conception — as 24, but <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Word of God</a> is that the writers nudged Homer and Marge's ages up a few times so that they wouldn't be older than them). A much later episode has some women at a park assume Bart is Homer's grandson.

She resumes dyeing it at the end of the episode because she doesn't like being mistaken for an older woman.

The later episodes have Mr. Burns as somewhere in the 100s ("Homer the Smithers" confirmed that he was 104; "Goo Goo Gai Pan" had him as 109, with a driver's license that expired in 1909). That said, "The Regina Monologues" and "Them, Robot" imply that Mr. Burns' age has <em>four</em> digits in it (in the former episode, his PIN number for his bank card is his age [PIN numbers are four digits long, for those who live in countries that don't have bank cards or ATMs or have them in a different format than in America], and in "Them, Robot", Homer asks Mr. Burns how old he really is, and Mr. Burns says, "Well, it has four digits...").
</li><li> Albert the spokesman for "Big and Beautiful", an organization for encouraging and accepting overweight people. He looked like he could have been in his 40s or 50s but as it turns out he was only 23. Homer was horrified when he learned of this as he had just died of a massive heart attack.
</li><li> Marge's sisters Selma and Patty are completely grey despite only being 42 but they reveal in one episode that it's due to all the smoke and ash from their cigarettes. They're actually still completely blond and redhead respectively.

</li><li> Nobody could tell how old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MichaelJackson">Michael Jackson</a> was in his later years, mainly because of his vitiligo that made his skin white (he looks much whiter in the photos because of the camera lightning) and because he had no wrinkles.

Jones is 11 years younger than Sutherland and nearly 20 to the others, yet he is portrayed as being around the same age as his co-stars in a film where a running gag is that many of their peers from their training days decades ago are all dead from old age (and Jones was <em>fifty-four!</em>).

Which is kind of funny, since throughout his adult life he possessed the voice of a 20-something guy from Boston.
</li><li> Jeremy Clarkson of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear">Top Gear</a></em> has consistently looked at least ten years older than his real age for some time now.

<ul><li> To be fair, Dick Smith did a very good age makeup on von Sydow for <em>The Exorcist</em>; you just don't notice it because of the flashier work on Linda Blair.

He looked more like he was about 20-22. It didn't help that his character was supposed to be 15. He actually seemed age appropriate a good amount of the time, but his build made him seem older. Still, it's a little hard to believe he was the youngest of the original six, as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JasonDavidFrank">Jason David Frank</a>, who was 19 at the time, looked fairly age appropriate.

But in her early 30s, she seemed to have aged rapidly, and looked like she was in her 40s by the time she was 35. (This can be chalked up to a drug addiction past and once she got sober, she started looking younger. Her aging now can be chalked up to plastic surgery and pregnancy.)
<ul><li> Fergie as an example goes back to her <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KidsIncorporated" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KidsIncorporated">Kids Incorporated</a></em> days; particularly the last two seasons she was a cast member.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TammyLynnSytch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/TammyLynnSytch">Tammy Lynn Sytch</a> went to pieces after the death of her husband, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisCandido" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ChrisCandido">Chris Candido</a>. Drug use, weight gain and a deeper voice has made her look and sound like she's in her late fifties even though she's only 47 as of this writing (born in December 1972). While she looked good again by the time she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, her looks have fallen apart again.
</li><li> Yet another WWE alumnus, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wrestling/ArnAnderson">Arn Anderson</a>, made his professional debut when he was 24, but due to the fact that he had a beard, a bit of a paunch and began losing his hair at a young age and wore combover, he looked like he was in his forties. He's changed very little since then, so his age caught up to his appearance.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeiraKnightley">Keira Knightley</a> benefited from this early in her career.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JenniferLawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> was able to play the female lead in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilverLiningsPlaybook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SilverLiningsPlaybook">Silver Linings Playbook</a></em> who has been married for several years, and is the love interest of 37-year-old <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradleyCooper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BradleyCooper">Bradley Cooper</a>.

</li><li> Tyler Bate debuted for <em>Over the Top</em> wrestling in Ireland when he was only nineteen. Due to his muscular physique and mustache, he looked about mid-twenties.
<ul><li> He was the same age when he became the inaugural WWE UK Champion; he eventually grew a full beard and gained even more muscle mass and definition, and <a class="urllink" href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EXCVhcsiB04/maxresdefault.jpg">could easily pass for a man of at least thirty, if not older<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small>.

However, because of the way she dresses and makes herself up (and also because of how she behaves) she can easily be mistaken as a teenager of 16 or 18. She has caused great controversy in Brazil, as her father is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMom">accused of sexualizing his daughter in order to help her career</a> as a singer.

This may be due to the orthostatic intolerance that caused him to retire from the group. <a class="urllink" href="https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/1200/https://media.salon.com/2012/01/yellow_wiggle.jpg">This<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> is what he looked in 2006 aged 35 and <a class="urllink" href="https://i2.wp.com/tvtonight.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020-01-22_2120.jpg">this<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> is how he looks in 2020 at age 48.

</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahKerr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeborahKerr">Deborah Kerr</a> sometimes played women who were in their thirties before she was actually that age. She had been hoping to play the teenage Queen Elizabeth I in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungBess" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoungBess">Young Bess</a></em> and was not pleased to be shunted into the small supporting role of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineParr" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CatherineParr">Catherine Parr</a> (who was mid-30s) instead. And in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeaAndSympathy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TeaAndSympathy">Tea and Sympathy</a></em>, she was only 33 playing a housewife who's implied to be in her forties. Some of her other roles subverted this however - such as <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackNarcissus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackNarcissus">Black Narcissus</a></em> where she's outright said to be too young for her position and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInnocents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInnocents">The Innocents</a></em> where she's a young governess on her first job.
</li><li> The woman in Grant Wood's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanGothicCouple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmericanGothicCouple">American Gothic</a></em> painting was intended to be his daughter, but her plain clothes and world-weary expression make her look almost as old as her father. The result is many come to the assumption they're a married couple.
</li><li> Irish actor Greg Young went through a growth spurt after <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNutters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNutters">The Nutters</a></em> and played roles older than his actual age (such as a soldier in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatIStandFor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhatIStandFor">What I Stand For</a></em>) - helped by growing a thick beard to go with it. At the age of nineteen, he played a college professor! And in <em>Mr Peterson</em>, when he was still eighteen, he played a twentysomething. That being said, he shaved his beard for other roles and was able to pass for even younger.
</li><li> Also from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNutters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheNutters">The Nutters</a></em>, Mason Creedy, who played the bully Ryan was three years younger than the rest of the cast (who were all sixteen-seventeen) but looked the same age.
</li><li> Thomas Fitzgerald was only twenty when he made <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Aaron" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Aaron">Aaron</a></em> and lines in the script indicate his character is that age too - but the longer hair and thick beard made him look several years older (it's said he was a drunken lout in his youth, which would account for this). He looked his actual age in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighAndTight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HighAndTight">High and Tight</a></em> without the beard. Likewise, he was nearly turned down for <em>Mr Peterson</em> for appearing too old for the role of the teenage delinquent Archie (but again, he shaved the beard and was cast).
</li><li> Serial killer <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Puente">Dorothea Puente<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> used this as part of her sctick to lure victims and evade capture. During the time of the murders, she was in her 50s, and ran a boarding house for people down on their luck, whom she would kill for their social security checks. But she intentionally dressed and styled her hair to appear much older, because who would suspect the little old frail 70 year old lady of comitting over 10 murders and burying them in her yard?
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RitchieValens">Ritchie Valens</a> was only 17 years old when he died, but he looked like a middle-aged man.
