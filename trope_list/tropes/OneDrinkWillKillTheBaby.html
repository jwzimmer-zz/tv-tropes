<p></p><div class="indent"><em>"<strong>Government Warning:</strong> According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects."</em>
<div class="indent">— Warning label found on all alcoholic beverages in the United States
</div></div><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_1"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_1'); })</script></div></div><p>We all know about <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder">Fetal Alcohol Syndrome<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, the irreversible brain damage that results from prenatal exposure to alcohol. The problem is, nobody is sure <em>how much</em> alcohol it takes to do <em>how much</em> harm, and nobody is in a hurry to do an in-depth study on it. With the medical community in a state of permanent indecision about how much alcohol can safely be consumed by a pregnant woman (they can't exactly tell fifty expecting mothers to go on a bender and see what happens), the only thing certain is that "none" is definitely less than whatever the "safe" amount is, if one exists at all. This leads many women and doctors to advise that they play it safe and swear off the booze entirely as soon as they miss their first period, or even when they decide to actively start trying for a baby.
</p><p>Fair enough, but many TV shows take this to ridiculous lengths. Comedy series especially hang entire scenes on the pregnant woman desperately avoiding taking even a single sip of the wine offered, as if even a single drop of alcohol will irreparably harm the helpless little fetus. Conversely, the second a person serving drinks learns that the woman getting one is pregnant will be the one where you see the server stopping the pouring faster than you can imagine.
</p><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>Somehow it's always in a situation where not drinking alcohol would be suspicious or unacceptable. The woman is convinced that ordering a Pepsi at the bar (when she hadn't been averse to alcohol before) will cause everyone to shout, "AHA! You're pregnant!" when it's supposed to be a secret  and sometimes that is exactly how the pregnancy becomes known. This requires huge leaps of logic from the other people, instead of assuming the woman simply doesn't want to drink or is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedDriver" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedDriver">Designated Driver</a> for the evening.
</p><p>Even more ridiculous situations tend to arise when a character is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant">Mistaken for Pregnant</a> and the other characters desperately try to stop her from drinking without revealing that they "know". Compare <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildhoodBrainDamage">Childhood Brain Damage</a>, which usually occurs only once the kid is actually born.

<ul><li> In a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology">Artistic License  Biology</a>, <em>Greyshirt</em> features a girl born with Down Syndrome as a result of her mother boozing while pregnant. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is one thing, but Down's Syndrome is a <em>genetic</em> condition and has nothing to do with the mother drinking during pregnancy. While it's entirely possible a baby could have both, the two are in no way equivalent.
</li><li> In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryComic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FurryComic">Furry Comic</a> <em>Shanda The Panda</em>, the major character Missy is a classic case of being a reasonably functional victim of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome courtesy of her cold-hearted mother, who refused to stop drinking during her pregnancy.
</li><li> Averted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan">Iron Man</a></em> comic 181 that had the pregnant Gretl drinking at a bar just a few hours before she gave birth to a baby. The baby seemed to be fine, and this is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">Truth in Television</a> since exposure to alcohol is mostly a long-term developmental issue. In fact, before some modern drugs were invented, alcohol was used as a way to stop premature labor. If it didn't work then the kid would be born drunk (and still premature) but otherwise fine.

<ul><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotalDrama">Total Drama</a></em> story, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LegacyTotalDrama" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LegacyTotalDrama">Legacy</a></em>, Duncan offers to share his lunch with Heather, but she has to find her own beverage because all Duncan has is beer. For the sake of her 8-month fetus, Heather is unwilling to drink anything alcoholic.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter">Harry Potter</a></em> fanfic <a class="urllink" href="http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7181871/1/Foolish">"Foolish"<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> by Tonksaholic, there is a potion called thead that "...mimics the effects of alcohol. Normally, it's not dangerous, but it interacts violently with the hormones produced during pregnancy..."
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyInnerLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyInnerLife">My Inner Life</a></em>. There's a scene where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OriginalCharacter">Jenna</a> (pregnant with her second child) and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda">Link</a> visit a griffin city and drink a lot of some alcoholic drink that's apparently very potent. Not only does Jenna not think twice about getting heavily drunk while pregnant, but neither Link nor the griffin who brings them the alcohol show any misgivings about a woman who should be visibly pregnant getting hammered. Given that Jenna also rides her horse for long distances, crosses an incredibly dangerous desert, and fights a dragon while pregnant and nothing is said of it, it's entirely possible the author simply forgot.
</li><li> In <em><a class="urllink" href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/288675">The Betrothal Contract<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a></em> Mr. and Mrs. Weasley discover Hermione is pregnant when they spot a bud growing under her and Ron's names on the magical family tree they've just been gifted.

</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StarVsTheForcesOfEvil">Star vs. the Forces of Evil</a></em> fancomic "It's Tradition," Star is told by her parents (who don't know she's pregnant) that she needs to take a glass of wine as part of the ceremony. Marco desperately warns her that she can't do it because of the baby—and that's before they bring out the "glass," which is a giant drinking horn bigger than she is. Star gets around this by simply dumping the whole thing over her head and giving some nonsense speech about symbolism.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder2');">    Film  Live-Action </div><div class="folder" id="folder2" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Parodied at the beginning of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DieHard">Die Hard</a></em>: Holly's heavily pregnant secretary is leaving to go to the staff Christmas party, and wonders if a sip of alcohol will harm the baby. Wryly, Holly says "I think that baby's ready to tend bar."
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhileYouWereSleeping" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhileYouWereSleeping">While You Were Sleeping</a></em>, when Jack points out - loudly, in front of all her friends - that the glass of champagne that Lucy is intending on having at a New Year's Eve party will be 'unhealthy for the baby'. Unfortunately for both, this is a case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant">Mistaken for Pregnant</a> and thus results in a very humiliating New Year's Eve for Lucy and a lot of apologizing required from Jack.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Juno">Juno</a></em>, the title character shocks the prospective adoptive parents of her child by requesting bourbon whiskey at their first meeting, even more so since she's also 16.
<div class="indent">"Ah, yes, the classic sense of humor. Just one of Juno's many genetic gifts."
</div></li><li> Parodied in the 2007 <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hairspray">Hairspray</a></em> adaptation. When Tracy and Edna are on their way to the clothing store, they pass a bar where a group of visibly pregnant women are smoking and making a toast "to the future" (it's set in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties">The '60s</a>, when people presumably didn't know the effect smoking and drinking had on fetuses).
</li><li> Played apparently straight in <em>Italian For Beginners</em>. Two long-lost sisters discover each other at the funeral of their father, shortly before their alcoholic mother died. The younger sister is so clumsy she can't hold down a job. The older sisters' nurse friend says this may well be fetal alcohol poisoning. It's then subverted in that the mother is treated for alcohol-related disease earlier in the movie.
</li><li> In the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InHerShoes" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/InHerShoes">In Her Shoes</a></em>, Maggie gets her sister's boyfriend to turn up for a reconciliation by pretending the sister is pregnant. He finds her with a drink in her hands. Maggie delays the inevitable denouement by grabbing the drink and pretending it's hers.
</li><li> <em>The Way We Were</em> averted this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> hits the movie hard when we see the visibly pregnant Katie holding a cigarette in one hand, and a glass of liquor in the other.
</li><li> There was similar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> in <em>Skyjacked</em>, which has a visibly pregnant passenger order a Bloody Mary on the rocks.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/Lajja" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Bollywood/Lajja">Lajja</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TroubledButCute">Janki</a> drinks to ease her stage fright, despite being 2 months pregnant, and laughs it off when <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist">Vaidehi</a> gives her a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero">What the Hell, Hero?</a>.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCiderHouseRules" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCiderHouseRules">The Cider House Rules</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittlestCancerPatient">Fuzzy</a>'s mother was an alcoholic, and as a result he suffered heart damage and breathing problems, which confine him to his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubbleBoy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BubbleBoy">oxygen tent</a>.
</li><li> Subverted in the film <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlackboardJungle">Blackboard Jungle</a></em>. At a restaurant, the protagonist pours his four-months-pregnant wife a cup of champagne. The wife only reacts in mild surprise that she's allowed to eat spaghetti and champagne while pregnant. She previously had a miscarriage but doesn't worry about what alcohol could do to her current child. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> is probably the reason, as the film is from 1955.
</li><li> Subverted in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DazedAndConfused" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DazedAndConfused">Dazed and Confused</a></em> when a visibly pregnant woman buys whiskey and cigarettes at the Emporium.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder3');">    Literature </div><div class="folder" id="folder3" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> Played with in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAliceNetwork" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheAliceNetwork">The Alice Network</a></em>. Charlie drinks during her pregnancy and it <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">doesn't seem to have any ill effects on the baby, who is, as far as we know, born healthy</span>. However, Charlie also planned to abort <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">before changing her mind</span>, and gin <em>was</em> suggested as one of the (apparently ineffective) ways to attempt to miscarry (some of the others being hot baths and falling down the stairs).
</li><li> Inverted in Robertson Davies' <em>The Lyre Of Orpheus</em>, where Maria drinks milk with rum in it while pregnant on the advice of her doctor (to help her sleep). The possibility of FAS is only brought up by a character who's treated as a crazy hippie by the narrative, and in fact the doctor seems more concerned that Maria might put on too much weight from drinking milk! (We now know that it is very important for pregnant women to consume plenty of calcium to help the foetus's skeleton develop.) While it's true that drinking in very small amounts is unlikely to harm a foetus, it's equally unlikely that a doctor would recommend it.

A nasty rumour about the character Bernard Marx (an Alpha) claims that he is short because someone spilled alcohol in his gestation bottle since pregnancy as we know it is nonexistent in the world of Huxley's novel and people are grown in artificial vats. And yes, alcohol introduced directly into the gestation environment is a poison. Ironically, <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld">Brave New World</a></em> was written <strong>years</strong> before Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was widely understood. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn">Huxley was even criticized for the idea that alcohol could harm a fetus</a>.

The character still avoids drinking wine, claiming that it upsets her stomach. This skirts implausibility, as the novel is set during the Napoleonic Wars, a time period when drinking plain unboiled water (which was always contaminated with bacteria, including Listeria) was immensely more dangerous to mother and fetus than drinking wine could ever be.

He and his partner nearly work themselves into a frenzy researching the possibility that they could get a kid with fetal alcohol syndrome... until they notice how some FAS information websites list restlessness and moodiness in teenagers, among other perfectly normal behavior for children of all ages, as "symptoms"—and that some of them could easily apply to ADHD. They come to the conclusion that if the child does have FAS, they'll deal, but that the risk is probably less than advertised.

</li><li> Sookie on <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilmoreGirls">Gilmore Girls</a></em> sent her husband Jackson off to have a vasectomy right after the birth of their second child (they'd both decided they only wanted two, and she didn't want to take chances). A while later, they came home early from a date because Jackson had ruined it by not letting her ski and spilling her wine at dinner. He confessed to Lorelei that he hadn't had the vasectomy and feared she might be pregnant again.

<ul><li> Shortly after Jamie and Paul realize she is pregnant, she almost drinks a sip of wine in a toast, and stops, looking as though she narrowly avoided drinking cyanide. Her OB/GYN is there and excuses Jamie's behavior by saying she is taking antibiotics.
</li><li> Jamie also acts this way about a sip of caffeinated coffee, which she is desperate to spit out, which is an even more exaggerated variation of this trope—while a pregnant woman (or anyone else) shouldn't drink caffeine in excess, the most restrictive medical guideline is that she can get away with 200mg a day, or slightly less than <a class="urllink" href="http://www.energyfiend.com/caffeine-content/espresso">three shots of espresso<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>.

</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Misfits">Misfits</a></em> finale has Jess drinking orange juice in the final scene while the other four drink lager, due to the fact that she believes she may have just conceived the baby she saw herself with in the future. It's an unusual mash-up of realistic and unrealistic aspects of this trope - since she's hoping to become pregnant in the near future, if she isn't already, giving up drinking would be medically advised; however, she believes herself to be a few hours pregnant at most, a stage so early that most pregnant women (including Jess, had she not seen the future) wouldn't even know about it, and would probably still be drinking as normal.
<ul><li> Earlier on, Marnie in the Series 2 Christmas special develops an elaborate prediction of how her relationship with Nathan would develop if they were to go for a drink at the bar right there and then, but ends (mock-sadly) by pointing to her baby bump and pointing out that she can't drink.

Among them is Mudflap. She is heavily pregnant but drinking as hard as the rest. Bob seems to think she shouldn't be doing that but, since she and her friends are all <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassBiker">Badass Biker</a>s, he is not about to stop her.

<ul><li> After Meg claims to be pregnant, Lois advises her that if she's going to dose herself on drugs and alcohol to induce a miscarriage to be committed to it, otherwise she'd end up giving birth to something like Chris.
</li><li> In another episode, Lois has a dream where she finds out that Stewie's evil and bent on world domination. After she realizes this, she cries, "Why!? Why did I have to smoke pot when I was pregnant with you!?"

<ul><li> In the episode "The Judge", a recently-pregnant Princess Carolyn visits her boyfriend Ralph's parents but isn't ready to tell them she's pregnant yet. They offer her some alcohol to calm down, but she declines. They <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialEscalation">keep insisting she indulge in something else,</a> such as cocaine, smoking, standing around secondhand smoke, some highly-caffeinated coffee, a quick punch in the stomach to make her feel alive, or a ride on their extremely fast rollercoaster. Eventually, Ralph has to step in and change the subject.
</li><li> In the next episode "Ruthie", Princess Carolyn is hesitant to drink coffee, but Ralph allows her to have a little sip. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">She later miscarries, but it's unclear if this is connected to the coffee, especially since it had been pointed out earlier in the season that it's hard to have children at her age and the reveal she's had four miscarriages beforehand.</span>

</li><li> In the season 4 finale of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Archer">Archer</a></em>, Lana vehemently refuses alcohol. At the end of the episode, she reveals her pregnancy. This carries over into the next season, with her hard-drinking coworkers often trying to offer her alcohol and Lana pointing out that she couldn't possibly have any since she's pregnant. Averted in a flashback, where Malory asks for a drink after her water breaks.
</li><li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark">South Park</a></em> episode "Cartman Joins NAMBLA", Kenny tries to stop his parents from having another child. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroinAttack">Throwing a baseball at his dad's groin</a> doesn't work, so he mixes a drink laced with abortion pills for his pregnant mother.

<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder11');">    Real Life </div><div class="folder" id="folder11" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> As recently as the early 1980s, an old wives' tale in many cultures, including some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChristianityIsCatholic">Catholic</a> cultures (such as some Irish and Italian cultures), stereotyped as having <em>lots</em> of healthy children due to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">birth control restrictions</a> while also using wine in their Mass, held that a pregnant woman drinking a small amount of wine or a small amount of beer was actually <em>beneficial</em> to a fetus. Recent scientific studies have suggested some Italian grandmothers <a class="urllink" href="http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/InTheNews/MedicalReports/GeneralHealth/20090324114942.html">are right,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as always, on this issue.
</li><li> In the 1940s, doctors sometimes advised new mothers to drink Guinness stout because the yeast in the brew was supposed to promote milk production.
<ul><li> Some doctors will still recommend that if a nursing mother has trouble letting milk down, she can have a drink (ONE drink, as in, just one beer, or a glass of wine) to relax before nursing.
</li><li> On a related note, <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Wills">Lucy Wills<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> found that anemia in pregnant women could be treated with yeast extract, the most available source being Marmite - a yeast extract that is a by-product of beer production.
</li></ul></li><li> While current <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunWithAcronyms">National Institute for Clinical Excellency</a> guidelines advise teetotalism during the first three months of pregnancy, the guidelines also state that consuming no more than two units of alcohol up to twice a week has not been shown as harmful to foetuses and that consumption of more than 7.5 units is proven to increase the risk of birth defects and other problems.
</li><li> A survey of bartenders showed that most would not serve alcohol to women who appeared to be pregnant. Some fear lawsuits because with the US being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit">such a litigious society,</a> a mom could come back years later and attempt to sue the bartender for every problem her child ever had. (No one has ever tried it, and it's unlikely she would win, but who wants to take that chance?)
<ul><li> This is why, in January 2011, <a class="urllink" href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/pregnant-lady-turned-illinois-bar/story?id=12600511&amp;page=1">a woman was kicked out of a bar just for being pregnant,<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> despite the fact that she wasn't, and had no plans to be, drinking alcohol.
</li><li> On the other hand, a sex-discrimination case could be made against the bar for <em>refusing</em> service, especially if the woman was <em>not</em> pregnant and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForPregnant">bartender just assumed.</a> TIPPS classes actually avert this trope and tell you that, against your first instinct, you should serve the woman, because it would be much harder to prove <em>yours</em> was the One Drink that killed the baby than that you turned a customer away.
</li></ul></li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope">Inverted</a> when it comes to nicotine and tobacco. While it can harm the baby, the stress from suddenly going cold turkey from nicotine can have a much greater effect on the baby. However, talk to an obstetrician before you try this. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndKnowingIsHalfTheBattle">Don't blindly follow medical advice from the internet.</a>
</li><li> If you think pregnant women could get out of this by simply avoiding alcoholic beverages, you're wrong. There have been concerns over caffeine use, as some studies have shown a slight correlation with miscarriage in early pregnancy, which is why decaffeinated coffee and tea have been promoted to pregnant women. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Pink">P!nk</a> was criticized for posting a picture of her drinking decaf, because decaf contains <em>trace</em> amounts.
