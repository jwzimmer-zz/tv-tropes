Who, incidentally, by the end of the manga pretty clearly utterly fail to exist. Most of the few actual women he's seen with turn out to be agents with his foster mother's information network.

A particularly notable case occurs when it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> a seemingly ordinary cookbook is actually code for the process to create a Philosopher's Stone</span>.

Their friends Kurapika and Leorio figure out which hotel the Troupe will go to and intercept them there. As a way of cluing Gon and Killua that they're there in the hotel's lobby and what they're about to do, Leorio proceeds to yell angrily at someone over the phone pretending he's a boss giving a perpetually late employee a final warning, peppering his speech with words and phrases like "black" and "8:00 sharp" to signal to them the power will go out at exactly 8:00. The sudden blackout <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">stuns the Phantom Troupe members (and everyone else in the lobby) enough for Gon and Killua to escape and for Kurapika to capture Chrollo.</span>

</li><li> One eighties spy comic had the hero accidentally join an eco-terrorist group when stating that he didn't smoke because it was bad for the environment, thus accidentally providing the countersign the group's new bomb-maker was supposed to give. The eco-terrorists apparently assumed that anyone who wasn't their contact would cite the health benefits rather than the environmental impact as their reason, and are shaken when the hero points out that literally <em>everyone</em> knows that tobacco cultivation is extremely draining on the soil and requires huge amounts of pesticides. The eco-terrorists turn out to be sympathetic anti-heroes, so it works out.

A klansman who went to another city and was looking for other klansmen (in a bar, for example) would ask people "Do you know a Mr Ayak?" (=<strong>A</strong>re <strong>Y</strong>ou <strong>A K</strong>lansman?) The answer he expected would be "Yes, and I also know a Mr Akai." (= <strong>A K</strong>lansman <strong>A</strong>m <strong>I</strong>.) They also used many codewords by simply substituting Kl at the beginning of words, like Kloran (from Quran) for their ritual book. Which tended to sound pretty silly.

It can be written on a note, worked into casual conversation or printed on a book or newspaper you are carrying — doesn't matter.

</li><li> Lampshaded in Manning Coles' <em>Drink to Yesterday</em> when agent Tommy Hambledon remarks to the much younger and more naive Michael Kingston/Bill Saunders:
<div class="indent">"Do get out of your head these ideas about elaborate plans which are so popular in fiction. You know: At eight forty-four and one half precisely you will walk past the automatic weighing-machine on the down platform, and a man in a pale-blue Homburg hat will pass you and murmur either 'Catfish,' 'Plaice' or 'Cod,' or 'Salmon.' 'Catfish' means the courier is a large savage man armed to the teeth who never sleeps, with an escort of eight of the Prussian Guard so alert that they take it in turns to breathe. That's to let you know it's going to be a little bit difficult. 'Plaice' means that he will have a girl friend with him, so look out for squalls. That's rather a good one, pass the beer. 'Cod' means that, though he travels alone, he is a dangerous homicidal maniac who is quite sane till anybody touches his luggage, when a violent complex is suddenly released and he is possessed with a passion for peritoneotomy—" <br/>"What's that?" <br/>"What Jack the Ripper did. 'Salmon' means that he is a weak little man suffering from incipient sleeping-sickness. Salmon is never served up on our job."

</li><li> In Peter Benchley's <em>Q Clearance</em>, a Soviet spy in Washington DC is supposed to receive a package from an courier. He and his handler try to come up with the appropriate Spy Speak to prove his <em>bona fides</em>. The spy considers the handler's dialog suggestion impossibly polite for the urban neighborhood:

He'll say, "No, but I'm waiting for a call." You say, "I'll find another phone then." <br/><strong>Pym:</strong> <em>[thinking]</em> In <em>this</em> neighborhood? It'll be more like "Is this phone broke?" "The fuck's it to you?" "I gotta make a fuckin' call." "You touch that fuckin' phone, I'll break all your fuckin' fingers."

The novel depicts a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceState">totalitarian state</a> whose citizens use "koalang" (associative-allusive language) to mask anything that might be considered subversive by the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StateSec">secret police</a>, especially when speaking in public, for example:
<div class="indent"><strong>Man:</strong> The gray angel entered my dreams uncannily (A policeman infiltrated my home thinking I'm asleep) <br/><strong>Girl:</strong> Has emptiness filled the shard of space? (Did he take something?) <br/><strong>Man:</strong> Though a ferret past in the time extended, my hand's voice curtain was left untouched. But hyena's longing still strong remain. (Even though he was searching for a long time, he didn't find my communication jammer. But it's likely the bastard will return soon).
</div></li><li> Several variations on these types of code show up in Timothy Zahn's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsExpandedUniverse">Star Wars</a></em> novels, most prominently in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a>. In one case, Han and Leia are discussing Admiral Ackbar's political situation, disguising it by talking about his family life (although it's not perfect since, as Han points out, it was an improvised code and they really ought to have set it up in advance). In the annotated edition, Zahn relates how this was inspired by a discussion he himself had with a few friends while first writing the novel. In the middle of a restaurant full of Star Wars fans, and under strict orders not to reveal that he was working on a new novel, he was forced to talk around the identities of his characters (such as using "Brother" and "Sister" for Luke and Leia).
<ul><li> Another version, in the same novel, involves an open comm channel between the <em>Falcon</em> and some escort starfighters. Han orders the pilots to use the Cracken Twist, which causes them to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackPatternAlpha" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackPatternAlpha">move into a new escort formation</a>, then transmits some rendezvous coordinates. He then explains to Leia that the formation is just window dressing; the "Cracken Twist" is really an instruction to transpose the coordinates to reach their real destination.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HandOfThrawn">Vision of the Future</a></em> Han Solo, suspecting that his communications were being monitored by Imperial ships, sent a message to Lando Calrissian to rendezvous with him "two systems rimward from where you had no choice". In other words, two systems towards the galactic rim from Bespin, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack">Lando was forced to hand Han and Leia over to Vader</a>. (Alluding to his line, "Sorry, Han, but I had no choice.") Later in the same novel, General bel Iblis issues a recall order to two Rogue Squadron pilots (who are operating anonymously) reading simply "This is father. All is forgiven; come home at once."
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekColdEquations" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StarTrekColdEquations">Star Trek: Cold Equations</a></em>, Thot Raas of the Breen has this to say in a transmission to his superior: At sunset, the weevil digs in the grain. Raptors circle the hollow. The steed stands in the forest. The farmer must ring the bell before dark.
</li><li> In the second book of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabysittersClub" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBabysittersClub">The Babysitters Club</a>, the girls are worried about the possibility of a crook from the news (or any crook for that matter) showing up while they're on the job and how suspicious it would look for them to call the police so they come up with the following: The girl who thinks there's something up calls up a friend and asks "Have you found my red ribbon?" The person receiving the call responds "No; the blue one." which is followed by "Oh; that's okay." if the caller isn't sure there's trouble or "Now I'm gonna get it." to signify "I'm in deep trouble; call the police ASAP!"
</li><li> Often in The Resistance Trilogy by Clive Egleton, the main character would be having an innocuous discussion with someone he's apparently met at random, only for it to be revealed they're members of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> when they change subject, but with no mention of what words of the conversation were the sign/countersign.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance">La Résistance</a> fighters on Gereon in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GauntsGhosts">Gaunt's Ghosts</a> novel <em>Traitor</em> had a sign/countersign/duress code system. When trying to make contact with allies, the person in the safehouse asks, "How is Gereon?", then the resistance member responds with "Gereon lives." The phrases "Despite their efforts" indicates safety, whereas "Even though it dies" indicates that the response is under duress, i.e., a Chaos soldier has already found them.
</li><li> Subverted in the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedRoom" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedRoom">Red Room</a></em> series as the agents use magic so anyone listening in only hears normals conversations. Protagonist Derek says that plenty of agents still try to use spy speak for tradition, though, which he finds irritating.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardyBoys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HardyBoys">Hardy Boys</a></em> Casefiles, "Hostages of Hate," had two good instances of this:
<div class="indent">"The day dawned most promisingly." <br/>"Like a new world." <br/><br/>"We bring tidings of the new day!" <br/>"Then hurry the dawn!"
</div></li><li> The "metaphor" variant is used in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfThrones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AGameOfThrones">A Game of Thrones</a></em>, when one of the young Stark children overhears two spymasters comparing notes on the goings on in the court and debating how to proceed with their individual schemes. Unfortunately, the child in question doesn't have the context to understand what they are talking about (while the reader has only <em>some</em> context at that point), so none of the "good guys" are able to benefit from the inside info this could have provided.
</li><li> The <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TommyAndTuppence">Tommy and Tuppence</a></em> short story "Blind Man's Bluff" has an improvised metaphor code, as Tommy manages to tell Tuppence that she should phone Albert and get him to follow them when they leave the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlandNameProduct">Blitz</a> Hotel with their new clients, while apparently telling her to place an order with the hotel restaurant for tomorrow's dinner.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AddressUnknown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AddressUnknown">Address Unknown</a></em>: Max's friend Martin gets ever more involved with the rising Nazi party, to the point where he refuses to shelter Max's sister from the Nazis coming to kill her. From then on, every letter Max sends to Martin contains numbers (the weight of a relative's newborns) or colors (Max is an art dealer), in ways so obvious they <em>must</em> be a code, leading to the Nazis eventually arresting and murdering Martin as a traitor for corresponding with a Jew (Martin is entirely aware of what Max is doing, but his protests of innocence fall on deaf ears). The title refers to the final letter, sent back to Max because the man it was addressed to is no longer living there (or living at all).
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo">1632</a></em>: Harry Lefferts sets up a type 3 scenario with a contact in Italy with the sign "I am Romulus." and the countersign "I am Vulcan. Live long and prosper." Several people give him guff for his blatant fanboyism, until he points out that anyone in the 17th century who hasn't been told the countersign will, by virtue of knowing a lot about Roman myth and nothing about <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek">Star Trek</a></em>, assume that Romulus is meeting Remus. Of course, Lefferts is also a thoroughbred West Virginia hillbilly, and while he has gotten some lessons from real pros, most of his ideas about spycraft come from films.
</li><li> In Lawrence Block's <em>Tanner's Twelve Swingers</em> Evan has to go through this to enter an apparently-closed cafe in Krakow.

A simple example is "Thorn wishes Talon", which means that Thorn (Eisenhorn) is requesting a face-to-face meeting with Ravenor (Talon).

</li><li> A classic example in episode 1 had the other person unable to deliver the line (asking for matches), as his cigarette is lit before he can say anything. Not only that, but René couldn't give the correct response ("I don't have any matches") as he had been given a box of them only a minute earlier by Lieutenant Gruber. And just to top it off, René ends up <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForGay">Mistaken for Gay</a>.

Lieutenant Gruber gets suspicious, and asks where the nonsensical phrases like "Pierre enjoys riding his new bicycle" are coming from. René claims that he was the one speaking.

<ul><li> In the "Secret Service Dentists" sketch in episode four, a customer innocently enters a bookshop, whose manager tries with weird excuses to get rid of him, until:
<div class="indent"><strong>Arthur:</strong> But I was told to come here. <br/><strong>Bookseller:</strong> <em>[bundling him back in]</em> Well. Well, I see.

You're a greengrocer, I'm an insurance salesman. <br/><strong>Grip:</strong> Greengrocers are senior to insurance salesman. <br/><strong>Bag:</strong> No they're not! <br/><strong>Wallet:</strong> Cool it. I'm an ice-cream salesman and I am senior to both of you. <br/><strong>Bag:</strong> You're an ice-cream salesman? I thought you were a veterinarian. <br/><strong>Wallet:</strong> I got promoted.

<ul><li> The "spy" skits had these:
<div class="indent"><strong>Spy:</strong> In Leningrad the boulevards are bigger than Paris, yes? <br/><strong>Guy on train:</strong> I've never been in Leningrad. <br/><strong>Spy:</strong> You have the briefcase, you are White Bear?
</div></li><li> As <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TriggerHappyTV" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TriggerHappyTV">Trigger Happy TV</a></em> is a hidden camera show, they occasionally parody it further. For instance, if the spy discovers that the person he is talking to is not "Grey Squirrel" then he will get up and move on, followed by a man in a full body grey squirrel costume coming and sitting in his place a few moments later, much to the confusion of bystanders.

(Or whatever the on-the-face conversation was.)
</li><li> Parodied in the series <em><a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Adderly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Adderly">Adderly</a></em>: supervisor Greenspan, convinced his office is bugged, demands that his staff speak entirely in convoluted code-phrases (even when discussing whether they want sugar in their coffee). Adderly replies with an annoyed, "Dead parrots rarely sing."; Greenspan pulls out his code book and laboriously translates this, word by word, to mean, <em>"This... conversation... is... ridiculous."</em>

<ul><li> Lampshaded when Michael has to leave a message for the man he was supposed to meet but is called away. He mentions that spy speak is only successful when the other party can figure out what the message means, otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time. Fortunately, the other man does figure out that "John 3:14" written on the sidewalk in chalk means "St. John's Cathedral at 3:14pm."
</li><li> Lampshaded a second time when Michael realizes his phone is bugged. He ties up the surveillance team by calling random phone numbers and saying nonsensical things to whoever picks up, counting on the fact that the surveillance team will assume that he's relaying information in code and will waste hours of time trying to figure out what he's relaying.
</li><li> Another episode has Michael getting information from his team, which is disguised as a random conversation. Maddie rebuffs Jesse's offer to explain and translate the code herself:
<div class="indent">"Mr.Vane means there's a weather vane. Gray hair means a gray roof, and presidential refers to a white house."
</div></li><li> Maddie also had a code for Michael and his brother, which told them that their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbusiveParents">father</a> was in a drunken rage again.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost">Lost</a></em>:
<ul><li> Subversion: in the episode "The Man from Tallahassee", Locke is hiding in Ben's closet with a gun to Alex's head. Ben asks Richard to bring him the "Man from Tallahassee". Afterward, Locke asks if that was a code. Ben replies, "<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker">No, John, unfortunately we don't have a code for 'There's a man in my closet with a gun to my daughter's head.'

<ul><li> For instance, "we're bringing in some tailors from Sicily to do the job, why don't you see about getting them some scissors."

<ul><li> Parodied, naturally, in the first episode. Maxwell Smart, Agent 86, who has yet to meet 99, has been told by the Chief that Agent 99 will approach Max in a public location by informing him of one team beating another in baseball. Unfortunately, that team actually manages to beat the other team on the day before, so <em>everybody</em> is saying it. Max almost ignores her until she says the score was 99 to 86. And the fact that it was "Mets win double header" that was such a remarkable headline might be a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakeThat">Take That!</a> to the pre-'69 "Lovable Losers".
</li><li> Also spoofed with the ridiculous sign/countersign when Max first meet Hymie.
<div class="indent"><strong>Hymie:</strong> The blue sun melts the red snow. <br/><strong>Smart:</strong> And the purple water runs up hill.
</div></li><li> On another occasion the sign/countersign is the lyrics to <em>Dixie</em>. Max and his contact end up singing a duet.
</li><li> In another, Max is supposed to whistle <em>Yankee Doodle</em>, when he spots the target for his boss to follow. Unfortunately, he doesn't know how it goes, so he has to ask someone. By the time, the target appears, he forgets to whistle and just says "Yankee Doodle, Yankee Doodle". His boss figures it out, though.

<div class="indent"><strong>Tony:</strong> Do you remember we decided to put a tail on the new Cultural Attache at the Russian Embassy? <br/><strong>Control:</strong> Yes, I do remember.

On the other hand, the speech avoids the sign/countersign form, and the "disguise" is a light one — usually something along the lines of a manager speaking to his salesmen in the field. Apart from the true nature of their "business," the roles are in fact strongly analogous.
<ul><li> In episode "A Feasible Solution", senior agent Willie is sent to Cyprus with novice Jill. They run into a spot of trouble, and afterward Willie tells Neil, his boss, "I wanted to let you know how pleased I am with my new girlfriend.

</li><li> In "A Question of Loyalty", Mike's confidence is shaken by a failed mission, and while on his next mission he suggests that Neil send "my older brother". Neil says no, but "don't be surprised to see your pretty cousin from Grosvenor Square," i.e. Karen of the CIA, whose office is in the US Embassy, Grosvenor Square, London.<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note2392o');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note2392o" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note2392o');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Mentioning Grosvenor Square by name was unnecessary and perhaps indiscreet; "cousins" consistently means Americans.</span>

Chegwidden and the agent had worked out a code back then, with the key phrase being "It's a great day for baseball at Ebbets Field. I hear you used to umpire there."

<ul><li> In the original game, a random NPC in the Hell's Kitchen Clinic will ask JC "Who will help the widow's son?" and awkwardly excuse himself when JC doesn't understand. Though this is never stated in the game, the phrase is an old greeting and plea for assistance associated with the Freemasons.
</li><li> There is also the first contact with Harley Filben. Filben is a UNATCO agent on Liberty Island, to whom JC is supposed to identify himself with the phrase "Iron and copper". JC weaves the phrase into a seemingly innocuous question about the construction of the Statue of Liberty. Filben scoffs and says that just giving him the passphrase is enough.

The contact, who is obviously a geek who is just doing things this way because he takes the whole thing too seriously, is <em>supposed</em> to be greeted by the code phrase "Life and death have their determined appointments." Jensen can play it professionally and use the phrase like he's supposed to. Alternately, (and hilariously) he can dismiss the whole thing saying "Something something, death and taxes. Confucius." Or he can just walk up to the contact and demand the information.

<ul><li> After each mission, the protagonist visits one of several businesses (such as a pizza place, a VHS store, a night club, etc) and always meets the same clerk who will make small talk and offer him something for free.

They can also fake signals in a conversation to throw off the Sniper, who can listen to conversations to try and determine if the spy is signaling anyone. The problem is that the signal is always "banana bread," which sticks out in the otherwise humdrum background party conversation like a sore thumb. This has led many players to refer to any attempt (real or faked) to signal a Double Agent as "banana breading."

Spies walk into the front office of the player's safe house and say a randomly innocuous sentence. They must be turned away unless their sentence contains a codeword in a dossier. If it does, the player needs to type in the correct countersign (which is expanded into another innocuous reply using the countersign), and determine whether the spy's reply contains the correct third code word associated with the countersign before accepting them.

The codewords can be an innocuous word (e.g. skill), a location (e.g. Disposals), a job (e.g. Quartermaster) or a popular term (e.g. Greytide). They are given in sets of 3. (e.g. Sign: Quartermaster, plasma, Silicon. Countersign: Atmos Tech, skill, cryo).

<ul><li> At Airports, in Cruise Ships and other enclosed places where strangers gather, you may hear the Loud Speaker declare that "Friends of Bill W. are welcome at [Bar in such and such place]", this being code that a member of Alcoholic Anonymous (founded by Bill Wilson in 1936) is going through an craving at a bar and asks the Bartender to inform whomever happens to be a fellow struggler to show up and help them.
</li><li> Famed undercover FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone (better known under his alias "Donnie Brasco") confirms that this is actually <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision">how a lot of modern Mafia members talk</a> about "business". Because they can never be sure when law enforcement might be listening in, they tend to use <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuffySpeak">the vaguest language possible</a>, leading to such indecipherable statements as "Did you do the <em>thing</em>, with the two guys, in the place? No, no, the <em>other</em> place." Deciphering recordings of this jargon can be be a nightmare for law enforcement, who often listen for hours and hours without the slightest idea as to what or whom is being discussed. Even the Italian name of the organization, Cosa Nostra, just means "our thing".
<ul><li> Trouble is, even if law enforcement do know what they are speaking about, they may have trouble using it as evidence in court, as they'll have to convince the jury to interpret vague statements in a particular way.
</li><li> During the trial of Henry Hill, the mobster whose life <em>Goodfellas</em> was based on, the Feds brought in actual jewelers to testify that the conversations Hill was having weren't actually related to jewelry work and were instead code for drug deals.
</li><li> There are stories around here of drug dealers using similar codes, talking about delivering different colours of paint to talk about different drugs or amounts of them. There are also stories of that going wrong in the obvious way...
<ul><li> A <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StupidCrooks">Stupid Crooks</a> website (which has sadly been taken down) reported a case where drug buyers would ask for drugs by asking the dealer (who worked at a fast food restaurant) for a certain kind of food. The operation was discovered when a normal customer asked for that certain kind of food and got drugs as a result. The moral of the story: If you use a code phrase for illegal items, don't make it something that could logically be asked for at that place.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> John Barron's non-fiction book <em>KGB: The Hidden Hand</em> tells of a KGB agent explaining to an American he'd recruited about the use of signs and counter-signs, whereupon the man burst out laughing — he'd assumed that such talk had been a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityIsUnrealistic">ridiculous invention of spy novel writers</a>.
</li><li> Victor Suvorov, a former GRU (Soviet military intelligence, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InterserviceRivalry">rival agency to the KGB</a>) says in <em>Inside the Aquarium: Making of a Top Soviet Spy</em> that signs and code phrases used in the field should be as innocuous as possible (and usually accompanied with similarly innocuous behaviour, like holding a newspaper under one arm). He also describes at least two situations when he almost missed the sign himself while meeting with contacts.
<ul><li> He also said in interviews that the academy where he trained had a regular name, a secret name and a top secret name. Not one of these reflected its nature as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySchool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpySchool">Spy School</a>.
</li></ul></li><li> People in Romania tried to use Spy Speak while talking about taboo subjects during the communist era. "Did the kids like the grapes I sent" was a possible analogy for asking if the family got the illegal books you bought in other countries. Granted, this never worked, as the state police did house wipes at the slightest suspicion. It did mean they have an excuse to beat someone up, empty their refrigerator and get praised for not killing/raping anyone.
</li><li> This was the purpose of Cockney rhyming slang (ex. apples and pears = stairs), which sounds absolutely silly to Americans. However, when used <em>properly</em>, only the first word would be used — so telling someone that "your pitch was upset with John getting his hands on your Persian and now your trouble is brown and you need an April" would be a bad situation to be in<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note3v60s');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note3v60s" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note3v60s');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Translation: Your boss (<strong>pitch</strong> and toss) got mad with you and had your wife (<strong>trouble</strong> and strife) killed (<strong>brown</strong> bread, i.e. dead) because you allowed the police (<strong>John</strong> Hop) to seize your drugs (<strong>Persian</strong> rug).</span>. The slang was meant to be impenetrable to outsiders so that dodgy deals could be carried out in relative secrecy unless the listener was also Cockney (and therefore a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveableRogue">Loveable Rogue</a>) and knew what each word actually meant.
</li><li> General Lloyd Fredendall, a US commander during World War II, had a tendency to tell his staff to cut orders to subordinate commanders referring to "clouds", "popguns", "walking boys", and grid co-ordinates "starting with C". The unfortunate thing was that he never told anyone what his terms meant.
</li><li> A very common military strategy is for a soldier to challenge an approaching unknown with a number. The newcomer responds with another number, and their numbers should add up to a previously agreed upon number. A variation is to use hand signs to signal the numbers back and forth, while lessening the risk of outsiders overhearing the numbers. The number they are supposed to add up to will usually change from one day to the next as well. This is also particularly handy if you are wearing <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GasMaskMooks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GasMaskMooks">chem warfare gear</a> that makes it difficult to talk clearly without shouting or to dig an ID card out of a pocket.
</li><li> Many forms of thieves' cant were invented exactly for this purpose. Russian <em>ofenya</em> is one of the modern examples.
</li><li> In cryptography, messages will be padded with nonsense for various reasons, depending on the encryption method used (including concealing the length of the message, or bringing it up to a whole number of blocks when using an encryption method that works on blocks of fixed size). During the Battle of Leyte Gulf, Admiral Nimitz sent a <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_world_wonders">message<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> to Admiral Halsey: "Where is, repeat, where is Task Force Thirty Four?". Routing information and padding was added to the message, and it was then transmitted. Upon receiving it, Halsey's radio officer removed the padding on the front, but overlooked the padding on the back. So the message that got handed to Halsey was "Where is, repeat, where is Task Force Thirty Four? The world wonders." Halsey took this as a sarcastic insult (as well he might) and then deliberately delayed for an hour.
</li><li> In political debates, these are called "dog whistles" — like Spy Speak, seemingly innocent phrases meant to give a cowardly debater plausible deniability if said debater wishes to hide or misrepresent their real opinions. The term, of course, comes from those whistles that dogs can hear and humans (usually) can't because they're outside the upper bounds of human frequency perception. A common one would be talking about "inner-city issues", which most people would understand as a veiled attack on ethnic minorities (who tend to live in the poorer downtown areas of American cities). To explain why a politician would want to take this risk: Dog-whistle words are usually used by politicians who belong to large, diverse parties (like the two all-inclusive parties in the US). They allow a politician to give subtle lip-service to the more extreme fringes of their party while (hopefully) not offending the less radical center. Of course, this can lead to situations where some listeners interpret something as a dog whistle when it wasn't actually intended that way.
</li><li> This was fairly common practice in World War II naval codes. The names of locations would be meaningless nouns, so even if the code was cracked the enemy's information is limited. They may know a carrier task force is headed to "eggplant", but not what or where "eggplant" is. Adm. Yamamoto's task force had to sail for around two weeks to reach Pearl Harbor, during which Japan was still trying to come to a diplomatic solution. Yamamoto was to only attack Pearl Harbor if he received a transmission involving the words, "climb Mt. Niitaka." Sure enough, this message was received. <br/><br/>This confusion played a major part in the Battle of Midway. The US knew the Japanese were on the way to "AF" and suspected they would attack Midway island, but they didn't know for sure. They sent a fake message in the clear stating that Midway needed fresh water, which the island itself has no springs of. Later they intercepted a Japanese message saying that AF was short on water. That's how they found out the Japanese were going to attack Midway.
</li><li> Businesses such as malls, department stores, or movie theaters will often have a set of innocuous-sounding code phrases that can be announced over the PA or radios to alert employees to problems or threats. These are designed to sound like normal messages so as not to panic the customers.
<ul><li> The stereotypical one being "Manager <strong>Red</strong>mond to storage room 5" to signify that storage room 5 is on fire.
</li><li> Some schools do this as well, where the office will page a former/deceased teacher or administrator as a signal to lock doors and turn off lights (as with a school shooting or similar incident).
</li></ul></li><li> Passwords in Freemasonry use the sign/countersign technique but usually with gestures, letters, and sounds instead of words.
</li><li> Some taxi businesses use these. If a fare was proving to be troublesome, they have two innocuous-sounding phrases they can transmit as part of the usual taxi-to-despatch radio communications. One phrase means "need assistance", the other means "need police". They're subtle rephrasings of one of the standard status calls.
</li><li> US military operations used to be named with a form of this, assigned two random words (e.g. "Market Garden") to prevent anyone from inferring anything about the nature of the operation. Nowadays many are given more overtly PR-friendly names (e.g., "Iraqi Freedom" for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, "Just Cause" for the 1989 invasion of Panama, "Tomodachi" (Japanese for "friend") for relief efforts following the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), though here it is more for <a class="urllink" href="http://thepunchlineismachismo.com/archives/comic/this-whole-storyline-was-supposed-to-happen-like-the-third-month-into-this-comic">selling the action for public support<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> as by now such large-scale actions are nigh impossible to keep secret, and in any case more specific actions whose knowledge might be useful to adversaries still have such intent-obscuring names (e.g., Operation <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RedDawn1984">Red Dawn</a> for the capture of Saddam Hussein, Operation Neptune Spear for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden).
<ul><li> Other countries did this as well. To what extent the nature of the operation or project was betrayed by its name varied — Nazi Germany, for example, on one hand had invasion plans for several countries tied to colors (ex: the first Fall Grun ["Plan Green"] were invasion plans of Czechoslovakia had the Munich Conference fallen apart), which worked out all right. On the other hand, all the British needed to know about a project Nazi Germany had was its name ("Wotan", one German name for Odin, a one-eyed Norse god) to deduce it was a new radar system using a single location — obviously, that didn't do so well in the obscurity department.
</li><li> Another Nazi example is "Operation Sea Lion", their plan for an assault and landing on the coast of Britain, whose royal coat of arms has multiple lions. Note to all troperific generals: if it contains a clever reference to what you're planning to do, it's not a good code name.
</li><li> The British were known for honing the art of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIndicativeName">Non-Indicative Name</a>. For instance, Operation Dynamo (the evacuation of troops from Dunkirk) was so named because it was planned in an emergency session <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineOfSightName">in a dynamo room</a>. Operation Mincemeat (the planting of false documents on a real corpse in enemy territory) was literally picked off a list; in fact the name had been used by another operation some months before, and the names were recycled.
<ul><li> One exception to the random assignment of codenames was enforced during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WinstonChurchill">Winston Churchill</a>, who insisted that the landing site codenames for D-Day must not be selected in this manner, on the grounds that no widow should have to be informed that her husband had died in a valiant attempt to take Fluffy-Bunny or Teddy-Bear. Of course, the resulting names<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note4jm8m');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note4jm8m" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note4jm8m');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> Gold, Juno, Omaha, Utah, and Sword</span> were still largely non-indicative, with the small exception that it's kind of easy to work out which sites were American targets.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> People who do search-and-rescue operations sometimes use a "death code" when transmitting over open radio, to let other teams know they've found the body of the lost person while (nominally) keeping the media from finding out about it. For example, teams might be briefed by the incident commander to say they have found "a bottle of whiskey" instead of a body. This usually doesn't fool anybody.
</li><li> Any sufficiently developed slang can be this - lots of words with meaning known to only a selected few.
</li><li> A more light-hearted example: one Tumblr post that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MemeticMutation">rapidly went viral</a> suggested that users of the site could do this to find each other in real life. The idea was that if you thought someone was a fellow Tumblr blogger, you'd tell them, "Hey, I like your shoelaces", and if they <em>were</em> a Tumblr blogger, they'd reply, "Thanks, I stole them from the President". The idea was soundly ridiculed.
</li><li> The Navajo Code-Talkers used a form of spy-speak, since the Navajo language doesn't have specific words for most military items and personnel. Thus, a tank was a "tortoise", a tank destroyer was a "tortoise killer", aircraft were denoted by various types of birds, etc. One Navajo soldier (who was not a Code-Talker) was captured by the Japanese and asked to translate the code. He could recognize it as the Navajo language, but the messages made no sense to him.
</li><li> "Tank" itself was originally a code word, chosen to disguise the development of armoured vehicles by referring to them as water tanks.
</li><li> Companies will often give codenames to projects in production, mostly to prevent competitors from figuring out what they're doing. The most evident one is filmmaking on location, upon which someone will post temporary signs on streetlights, telephone poles, and other structures with an arrow leading to the set and some word either marginally related or completely unrelated to what they're filming, particularly when the film is hotly anticipated - for instance, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReturnOfTheJedi">Return of the Jedi</a> was codenamed "Blue Harvest" during production. Similarly, high-profile film and TV releases will often be distributed under code names - when the new <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho">Doctor Who</a> was being prepared for broadcast its materials went out under the anagram title <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Torchwood">Torchwood</a>, which later acquired a series of its own because producer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RussellTDavies">Russell T Davies</a> liked the sound of it.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimJones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JimJones">Jim Jones</a> and his Peoples Temple group moved to Guyana in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSeventies">The '70s</a>, the only reliable way they could stay in contact with their home base in California was via <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwoWayRadio" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TwoWayRadio">amateur ("ham") radio</a>. One issue with this is that FCC forbids using ham radio to conduct business. Another was that as the cult's activities got more sinister, they didn't want outsiders to know what was happening. So they developed <a class="urllink" href="https://jonestown.sdsu.edu/?page_id=13222">an extensive system<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a> of code words and phrases for their ham transmissions. This didn't fool other ham operators, who lodged complaints to the FCC, but nothing was ever done about it.
