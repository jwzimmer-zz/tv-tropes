Any of the four possibilities ends up as a significant historical figure with a castle, a pile of gold, and their own personal army of devoted followers.

Jerrica and Kimber's parents were decently well off; however, Jem is shown multiple times to be hard on cash despite being a world-famous pop icon.

</li><li> Roman Emperor Diocletian worked his ways up the military and ultimately became emperor. It wasn't <em>that</em> uncommon in Rome, actually. If you were a <em>really</em> good member of the military and kept yourself away from the dangers in such an environment (injury, backstabbing, etc.), you could work your way up constantly and enact the trope. More than one Emperor aside from Diocletian arrived to power this way. (Now, whether they <em>stayed</em> there... that was something else)
</li><li> In the Eastern Roman Empire, the position of Emperor was literally open to everyone, allowing this to happen:
<ul><li> Justin I was a swineherd from Macedonia who arrived in Byzantium with nothing but the clothes he wore but ended up making a career in the legions. He later had his sister move to Byzantium as well with her children, and when he became emperor he made his nephew Justinian his closest advisor and successor. Justinian ended up marrying a nightclub dancer who ruled with him as Empress Theodora and they were without question among the most powerful people in the entire world at their time.
</li><li> Basil the Macedonian was born a peasant. In spite of his lack of education and limited experience in military and administrative matters, he became a favorite courtier of Byzantine Emperor Michael III and eventually succeeded him as emperor. He reigned successfully for 19 years, founded the Macedonian Dynasty, and started the Macedonian Renaissance.

He ruled as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RegentForLife">kampaku</a>— not a shogun— because he was adopted by a Fujihara just before the fact, and his legitimacy was only sustained through his own power.

</li><li> Young Dave Thomas was born to a poor, single woman, who gave him up for adoption. His adoptive mother passed away when he was six and his father was then left to move around (with Dave in tow) while he sought work. Thomas began working at the age of 12 (to help support the family), dropped out of high school, served in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, learned how to cook, came back home, worked at a diner, married the daughter of the diner's owner, and got his big break by meeting Colonel Sanders and setting up a few Kentucky Fried Chickens to own and operate. When Thomas sold his KFCs, which had become very successful because of his hard work, he earned enough money to settle down, but invested it instead in his own fast-food chain, and named it after his ginger-haired daughter: "Wendy's".

</li><li> While she was a student at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Russian operatic soprano Anna Netrebko was working as a janitor at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg when she was discovered by the prominent conductor Valery Gergiev, who then became her vocal mentor. She then went on to sing many prominent roles with the company, and then made her Met Opera debut as Natasha Rostova in Prokofiev's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarAndPeace">War and Peace</a></em> in 2002, right as the Met was introducing their <em>Live in HD</em> series.

In 1987, her third year in the conservatory, she was recruited by the Kirov Opera, and became a student of Valery Gergiev, a prominent Russian conductor who recognized her talents. From then on, she's won two international competitions, and after making her European debut as Dalila in Saint-Saën's <em>Samson et Dalila</em> alongside Plácido Domingo, she has now become an internationally acclaimed mezzo-soprano well-known for her roles in Russian operas, and has performed with many famous opera companies like the Met Opera, the Royal Opera House, and the San Francisco Opera. In addition, she has been awarded the State Prize of the Russian Federation and has received recognition as a People's Artist of Russia.
</li><li> Having been born in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War, Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé grew up in a family that couldn't afford to send her to school, so they made a deal with a wealthy family to have them finance her studies in exchange for her appearing at the Barcelona opera house every season. Her big breakthrough came in 1965 when she replaced Marilyn Horne in a production of Donizetti's <em>Lucrezia Borgia</em> at Carnegie Hall in New York, which earned her a 25-minute standing ovation. Since then, she became an internationally-acclaimed soprano who has performed with prominent opera companies such as the Met Opera, received several international awards, and has collaborated with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/FreddieMercury">Freddie Mercury</a>.

At first, he went from being involved with street gangs and drinking vodka to studying music at the conservatory in his hometown of Krasnoyarsk, then went on to win the Concours International de Chant competition in Toulouse in 1988. And while he suffered from alcoholism in the 1990s, he quit in 2001, which allowed his career to be revived in 2003, when he performed as Giorgio Germont in the Met's production of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaTraviata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaTraviata">La traviata</a></em>, and he then went on to become an internationally-acclaimed baritone up until his death from cancer in 2017.

After making her breakthrough as the title role of Bizet's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Carmen">Carmen</a></em> in 2009 at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan alongside Jonas Kaufmann, she has become a widely-acclaimed mezzo-soprano and has performed with various leading opera houses including the Met Opera, the Canadian Opera Company, and the Royal Opera House. In addition, she has also become very well-regarded in her home country, and frequently performs charity concerts on TV.
</li><li> French tenor Roberto Alagna is the son of Sicilian immigrants who moved to Paris in the 1950s, and he often busked and sang in Parisian cabarets when he was a teenager. Even when he switched to opera, he was mostly self-taught. After winning the Luciano Pavarotti International Voice Competition in 1988, Alagna made his professional debut as Alfredo Germont in Verdi's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaTraviata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/LaTraviata">La traviata</a></em> with the Glyndebourne touring company, which led him to singing with various European companies. His breakthrough, however, came in 1994, when he sang the role of Roméo in Gounod's <em>Roméo et Juliette</em> in Covent Garden. Since then, he has sung with numerous prominent opera companies, has become an advocate for restoring neglected French operas, and has been awarded a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 2008.
</li><li> Famous Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson was born on a farm in rural Sweden but had a real talent for singing from a young age. After a not-so-successful debut in von Weber's <em>Der Freischütz</em> at the Royal Opera in Stockholm (a failure that made her contemplate suicide shortly afterwards, due to the conductor being fairly harsh to her), she made a more successful debut as Lady Macbeth in Verdi's <em>Macbeth</em> in 1947, before making her international breakthrough at the Vienna State Opera. Her rise to stardom came from her debut as Isolde in Wagner's <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> at the Met Opera in 1959, after which she became the most celebrated Wagnerian soprano of the 20th century, even starting her own foundation to award major contributions to opera, and her portrait is now featured on the 500 kronor banknote in her home country.
</li><li> When <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HalleBerry">Halle Berry</a> first moved to New York to start her acting career, she briefly lived in a homeless shelter.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardBurton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RichardBurton">Richard Burton</a> grew up in poverty in a Welsh mining village. Acting saved him from working down a coal mine.
</li><li> When he was a boy, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimCarrey">Jim Carrey</a> and his family lost their home and had to live in a van. He quit school at age 15 to help support the family.
</li><li> According to his high school yearbook, Ralph Laurens goal was to become a millionaire. At the time, he was living in the Bronx as the youngest child of poor, Jewish immigrants. He enlisted in the Army and worked as a clerk at Brooks Brothers before becoming a business icon.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/DollyParton">Dolly Parton</a> was raised in a one-room cabin in the woods with dirt floors and little money. Her parents worked hard to stretch a dollar.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JayZ">Jay-Z</a> grew up in housing projects near Brooklyn and sold drugs to get by.
</li><li> <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HillarySwank" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HillarySwank">Hillary Swank</a> grew up in a trailer park in Washington. At 15, she and her mother moved to Los Angeles and lived in a car for a few weeks while Swank chased her acting dream.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CharlieChaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> grew up in Dickensian poverty. When he was seven, he and his brother were sent to a workhouse. He abandoned his education at thirteen and worked odd jobs in between stage appearances.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KirkDouglas">Kirk Douglas</a> had an impoverished childhood, with immigrant parents and six sisters. Growing up, Douglas sold snacks to mill workers to earn enough to buy milk and bread to help his family. Later, he delivered newspapers and during his youth, he had more than forty jobs before becoming an actor.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RKelly" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RKelly">R. Kelly</a> grew up in the Chicago housing projects with three siblings and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappearedDad">Disappeared Dad</a>.
</li><li> Salvador Perez, the catcher for the Kansas City Royals, was raised in Venezuela by a single mother. She got him into baseball to keep him occupied; he is now one of Major League Baseball's most decorated players, including six All-Star Game appearances, five Gold Gloves, and the MVP of the 2015 World Series.
