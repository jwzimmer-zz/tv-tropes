</p><p></p><ul><li> A <strong>Soldier</strong> is a fighter using their skills and training to get a job done or a cause fulfilled, with combat simply being a grim task to get there. They typically rely on a more structured chain of command, following orders and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyVersusTactics">limiting their own initiative to those that fulfill mission or campaign goals</a>. They are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFettered">The Fettered</a> and may even see themselves as civilians doing a temporary duty for a greater good.
</li><li> A <strong>Warrior</strong> is a fighter using their martial spirit and personal philosophy to fight, typically for honour and glory. To them, warfare is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocialDarwinism">contest of the fittest</a> meant to prove some sort of point, with either prowess, cunning or divine providence deciding a victor. Warriors are often very competitive; individual initative is given more weight, and they typically look down upon those that don't see combat or strength as a core virtue. Warriors typically consider themselves warriors at all times, even when not equipped for combat.
</li></ul><div class="proper-ad-unit mobile-ad square_ad"><h6 class="ad-caption">Advertisement:</h6><div id="proper-ad-tvtropes_mobile_ad_2"><script>propertag.cmd.push(function() { proper_display('tvtropes_mobile_ad_2'); })</script></div></div><p>In other words, a <em>Soldier</em> fights to live, and a <em>Warrior</em> lives to fight.
</p><p>A work that pits these two together typically invokes <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment">Romanticism Versus Enlightenment</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVsStoicism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionsVsStoicism">Emotions vs. Stoicism</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrderVersusChaos">Order Versus Chaos</a>, and either side can be shown as right or wrong. A work favoring the Soldiers will typically portray the Warriors as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanEmotional" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanEmotional">Strawman Emotional</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">The Horde</a> or some other disorganized mass of wild, bloodthirsty, and barbaric creatures. A work favoring the Warriors will typically portray the Soldiers as a mindless <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedShirtArmy">Red Shirt Army</a>, with no spirit or individuality. Some works may not favor either, but simply show them as two different (but necessary) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingCombatPhilosophies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OpposingCombatPhilosophies">Opposing Combat Philosophies</a>.
</p><p>One complication that can be commonly seen in cultural comparisons, but not as frequently represented in fiction, is that a more organized force often displays more of the connotations associated with the Warrior aspect, a standing army often being seen as more warlike than relying on civilian levies.

</p><p>Ironically, in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Humans Are Warriors</a> trope, humans tend to be the soldiers while the other species are warriors, and that is why <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreSpecial">humans are better at war</a>.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TurnAGundam">∀ Gundam</a></em>, there's a lot of discussion in the last arc about the proper reasons for fighting. Loran is on the Soldier side; he fights only to protect people because living at peace is nice. Gym Ghingnham believes that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreWarriors">Humans Are Warriors</a> and thinks endless warfare is the only way for the species to advance.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileSuitGundamIronBloodedOrphans">Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans</a></em>, this briefly happens when Tekkadan fights against Carta Issue. Mikazuki is on the Soldier side and is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatist</a> in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge">Roaring Rampage of Revenge</a>, Carta is on the Warrior side and is stuck in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornInTheWrongCentury">Pre-Calamity War Gjallarhorn knight</a> mindset. When Carta requested for a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatByChampion">Combat by Champion</a>, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Mikazuki outright ignored her request, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilledMidSentence">killed her bodyguards when they are outside the mechs</a> and delivered a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown">No-Holds-Barred Beatdown</a> to Carta herself.</span>
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan">Attack on Titan</a></em>, this is used within the Narrative, and explicitly brought up by several characters. The enemy <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Titan Shifters</span> refer to themselves as "Warriors", drawing a line between themselves and the soldiers they oppose. On the surface, the trope is played straight with human soldiers serving the cause of humanity's survival and the warriors being shown to be proud and even competitive. But then it becomes more complicated, with the lines becoming blurred as the warriors' identities are revealed. <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Reiner Braun best illustrates the blurring of things, struggling with his conflicting loyalties/identities</span>. Both sides have much more in common than they would like to admit, and there is plenty of debate over what it means to be a soldier. It isn't really clear which, if either, is actually better.
<ul><li> There's also an in-universe reason- <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In their cover identities, the shifters are normal human soldiers fighting against the Titans. At home, they're members of the 'Warrior Program', which is where Marley gets its Titan Shifters. Those who have recieved a Titan Power are Warriors, the rest are Warrior Candidates.</span>
</li></ul></li><li> The competing Hero Associations in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/OnePunchMan">One-Punch Man</a></em> emphasize this division in their structure and approach.
<ul><li> The Hero Association is a chaotic, disorganized mess with multiple factions vying for power and internal politicking prevalent. Their heroes don't work together, don't care about public perception, have no interest in organizational issues (barring a few exceptions) and are content to do their own thing. Their best assets are battle-hardened warriors including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychicPowers">the world's strongest esper</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed">an ultra-fast, highly trained ninja assassin</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist">possibly the most talented scientist in the world</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorldsStrongestMan">King</a>, among others. They are orders of magnitude stronger than almost any threat the world faces.
</li><li> The <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neo Heroes</span> are a heavily regimented organization who care about their image, take pains to share technology among their entire hero-list, and rely on artificial intelligence and systematic processes to assign heroes to cases according to their abilities. Their best assets, the <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> Neo Leaders</span> are seen struggling against monsters that the Hero Association's best would dispatch without effort (barring a few exceptions). Their emphasis on structure and rules means they are unable to hire or retain the truly exceptional talents who require flexibility and freedom.
</li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheSevenDeadlySins">The Seven Deadly Sins</a></em>, the two leaders of the Liones Holy Knights are rather unique cases. Dreyfus is a Soldier as he genuinely wants to protect people from the prophesied Holy War. However, he is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist">Well-Intentioned Extremist</a> who is willing to trample down anything or anyone for his ambitions. Hendricksen on the other hand is a Warrior as he is basically a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelKilgore" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonelKilgore">Colonel Kilgore</a> who believes that war is the only reason the Holy Knights exist in the first place. He believes this so much that he is willing to <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">revive the Demon Clan so that the Holy Knights can have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthyOpponent">Worthy Opponent</a></span>. Though it turns out that <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">both are being manipulated by a demon. One who is possessing Dreyfus.</span>
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossDelta">Macross Delta</a></em> has the Chaos mercenary group as the Soldiers and the Aerial Knights of Windemere as the Warriors. The Chaos pilots use strategy, military discipline and pragmatism to counter the Knights' ideals of chivalry and honor in combat. Ernest Johnson, the commander of Chaos, served as an instructor for the Windemerean military, working alongside King Gramia. They both discussed this trope, with Gramia expressing the importance of principles and ideals in battle, while Johnson said that as a mercenary, he couldn't afford to believe in such things because his job was to win, no questions asked.

Characters like B'Sanos and K'Ragh are more in the vein of Soldiers, thinking in terms of achieving objectives even if that means <em>avoiding</em> actual battle, while Warriors such as K'Hugh are in it to emulate heroes of the past and create their own legend. The latter works well when their orders are being carried out by the Soldier-types, but not so much when they end up fighting even-more-soldierly Starfleet officers such as Admirals Stephen Alcott and Jesu La Roca. Then there's interesting hybrids such as Starfleet's Kanril Eleya (raised in Bajoran Resistance traditions) and the Moab Confederacy Defense Force, who marry Warrior ingenuity, zeal, and affinity for fighting in smaller guerrilla-style units, to Soldier discipline and objective-oriented thinking.

</li><li> The Night's Watch and their perennial enemies, the wildlings. The wildling are described as fighting like heroes or demons, depending on who you ask — <em>"a shout, a slash, and a fine brave death"</em> — but have no discipline and no organization besides individual chieftains and big names. The Night's Watch, despite being an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArmyOfThievesAndWhores">Army of Thieves and Whores</a>, normally has no trouble standing them off because of their superior training, tactics, and equipment. And the 700-foot Wall they stand on.
</li><li> The Soldier vs. Warrior dynamic is shown most strongly in the Battle of Qohor. 3000 Unsullied stood their ground against a force of 25,000 Dothraki screamers. The Dothraki could have flanked the Unsullied, but instead charged right into them out of contempt for infantry. The Unsullied forces held out for days, repelling eighteen Dothraki charges and three attacks by Dothraki archers. By the end of it, the Dothraki had lost 17,000 of their number including their <em>khal</em> and his sons and his bloodriders, while the Unsullied lost 2400 of their number. The new <em>khal</em> and the remaining Dothraki left Qohor in peace but not before cutting off their braids and throwing them to the Unsullied as a mark of respect.

When Captain Pahner proposes to train an army in a few weeks one of the (alien) allies protests that it takes months to train a warrior. Pahner counters that they aren't going to train warriors, they are going to train <em>soldiers</em> and they can do that in a few weeks. Largely justified in that they are pretty much just training the new soldiers to hold a pike and shield wall so the training is mostly about getting them to march together and follow orders.

<ul><li> <em>At Any Cost</em>, the non-human natives have warriors who fight for glory, hunt human livestock as rites of passage, and are barely organized so despite their ability to teleport they don't make any ground in the war with the human colonists. While the humans have soldiers, who are organized but poor fighters and hampered by incompetent leadership. Then the humans hire Hammer's Slammers, a mercenary company of elite fighters with excellent organization and experienced leadership and the war is over in a couple weeks.
</li><li> <em>The Warrior</em>, when tank commander Des Grieux, who named his tank <em>The Warrior</em>, gets sick of letting his tank's guns be run by computer on Anti-Artillery duty during a siege and takes it on a rampage through the enemy forces, ripping them to pieces. Then, the next day he gets demoted for leaving his position and creating an opening that got many Slammers and their clients killed when—if he'd stayed put—their defense would have easily shrugged off the enemy attack until the relief force came though in 24 hours.

When cats first came to the forest, they were savage and lonely- fighting only for their own survival or that of their families. "It was a lawless, bloody time for the forest, and many cats died." After an especially senseless battle, the cats agreed to follow laws: they would not <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldiers">send kittens into battle</a>, they would not kill defeated enemies, and no cat would hunt in another's territory. Cats still fought frequently (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">because it's in their nature to do so</a>) but their adherence to the 'warrior code' resulted in a lot less death and paranoia.

The series climaxes with the titular Warriors fighting off a horde of untrained strays/Soldiers through superior tactics and experience.

One-on-one, a Mantis can almost always beat a Wasp thanks to their exceptional skill and personal drive, but in a mass battle the more numerous, more disciplined, and better organized Wasps have the advantage. In the context of the series, the Mantises are presented as the tragically doomed remnant of a bygone age, while the Wasps are a forward-thinking but tyrannical military juggernaut; both are heavily flawed, though the Wasps are much more consistently antagonistic (though not without <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MySpeciesDothProtestTooMuch">exceptions</a>).

Ender disrupts this system by teaching his underlings to act less like soldiers and more like warriors, breaking them up into smaller units trained to act on their own initiative to accomplish limited objectives and granting the army as a whole more flexibility.

Attack! Attack!</a> tactics and points out that the 597th is doing twice the damage of the Nusquan 1st while taking a third of the casualties. In general the <em>Cain</em> novels paint the 597th as highly organized, professional soldiers proficient in mechanized infantry warfare, in contrast to the enemy of the week (typically orks or tyranids), and non-Valhallan regiments in the series frequently believe more in showing zeal for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor">God-Emperor</a> than in tactics that do the most damage with the fewest deaths.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria">Victoria</a></em> portrays the war between the Northern Confederation and Azania as a struggle between these philosophies. Azania, a country of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand">high-tech Amazons</a>, use technology, communications, firepower and careful staff planning to compensate for the lesser individual strength of their female soldiers, whereas the Confederation armies depend on loosely organized forces of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">brave and spirited militiamen</a> to counter these advantages through audacity and numbers.
</li><li> A major theme in the appropriately titled Barrett Tillman novel, <em>Warriors</em>, with the fighter pilots on all sides falling decidedly into the warrior camp. At one point, the novel further distinguishes between warriors and "pure" warriors — effectively, those who love to fight and those whose <em>only</em> love is fighting.
</li><li> The Indian epic <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mahabharata" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> plays the Warrior trope straight for about 90% of the story, as it is about Kshatriya warrior princes jockeying for power over the kingdom of Hastinapur. They have intricate rules governing when they fight, how they fight, who they fight, where they fight, what actions are considered dishonorable during a fight. Combat between two princes is dealt with more like a duel or a sporting contest, rather than a battle. However, in the final Kurukshetra war, both the "good" Pandava faction and the "evil" Kaurava faction slowly discard these rules, and adapt more soldierly tactics such as perfidy, deception, disinformation, spying, tactical formations, usage of numerical superiority, execution of unarmed combatants, commando raids, targeting civilians, usage of divine weapons including divine WMDs and generally trying all means neccesary to slaughter the other side. The victorious Pandavas are well aware of this, by the time they win their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a>, and know they have a lot of atonement to do.

Uhtred — a Saxon warlord who was raised by Vikings — notes that the Vikings are individually better warriors than the Saxon soldiers, but the Saxons win through discipline and persistence, and also because the Vikings' warrior ethos means that they follow the strongest warlord, and leave him when he starts losing battles, whereas if the Saxons are beaten they retreat, regroup, and come back for more.
<ul><li> Notably, Uhtred himself over the course of the series moves from Warrior to Soldier. He starts out an arrogant glory-hound who loves battle and thinks only of the chance to show off his own prowess; as he ages and grows into authority, he shifts his focus to training and disciplining his men to stand together in the shieldwall, and comes to understand the importance of the ordinary peasants who they protect.

In the Earth-Minbari War, the Minbari won most battles thanks to their superior technology providing greater firepower and making their ships almost impossible to hit, but EarthForce kept them at bay for two years, and even <em>destroyed their flagship</em> (in the early days of the war to boot), through superior skills and dishonourable tricks such as sending a distress call and then blow up the nuclear mines when the Minbari flagship came to finish off the Earth ship<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note1rixq');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note1rixq" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note1rixq');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Although it's only "dishonorable" when the humans do it; the ship sending the distress call was genuinely crippled because the Minbari had ambushed its fleet with a very similar gambit and a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedAmbush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HyperspeedAmbush">Hyperspeed Ambush</a>.

</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpandedUniverse">Expanded Universe</a> introduces the Centauri-Orieni War, with (most of) the factions shifting side depending on the situation:
<ul><li> Early in the war, the Centauri were the Warriors to the Orieni's Soldiers, as the Centauri went in the war to conquer glory by destroying their old enemy while the Orieni carefully planned it, training their forces into an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteArmy">Elite Army</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven">with its own elite forces</a>, trying to weaken the Centauri by supporting Drazi <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePirates">raiders</a> (in fact the war started when the Centauri captured a raider ship and found an Orieni military technician and Orieni weapons), and making plans to get around the Centauri's enormous economic superiority-the Orieni's goal wasn't even to conquer the Centauri, just to take a chunk of their territory and relative resources (especially <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Unobtainium">quantium-40</a> mines, as their own space was scarce in that resource and it showed in the Centauri's superiority in numbers and quality of their jump drives) to bridge the gap, completely integrate it, and then repeat it until the Centauri were finally weak enough to be fully conquered.
</li><li> As casualties mounted, the Centauri shifted into Soldiers, pragmatically taking advantage of their superior numbers and production and logistically less intensive directed-energy weapons, while the Orieni became Warriors relative to that, refusing to water down the training of their forces (that slowly became too small to counter the Centauri's numbers) or to move away from logistically intensive <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticEnergyWeapons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KineticEnergyWeapons">Kinetic Energy Weapons</a> and wasting a large number of their forces in a strike against the Drakh as soon as they realized they were servant of the Shadows, the enemies of the Vorlon they worshiped as gods (the strike devastated the Drakh's presumed homeworld but suffered heavy losses and required to pull numerous ships from the frontline-something the Centauri took shamelessly advantage of).
</li><li> The well-trained and disciplined Centauri Royal Navy are the Soldiers to the House Militias' Warriors, though as the war erodes the Houses' power in favor of the central government's the Royal Navy <em>forces</em> the Militias to become a Soldiers' force.
</li><li> The undisciplined Drazi raiders and mercenaries are Warriors to the Centauri's soldiers, as even the House Militias at the start of the war were much more disciplined. Predictably, the Drazi are quickly kicked out of the war by the forces of House Torra and a few subordinated Houses (as the Royal Navy pulled their forces to concentrate them against the Orieni), and their later involvement is only as mercenaries for the Centauri that find them useful meat shields.
</li><li> House Torra and their subordinates are the Warriors to the Abbai's Soldiers, with Torra ignoring the demands of the war in favor of a strike against a perceived weak power to try and capture glory, territory and their superior technology (specifically <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialGravity">Artificial Gravity</a>, that the Centauri hadn't developed yet, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields">Deflector Shields</a>, that the Centauri wouldn't develop <em>period</em>) while the Abbai fought pragmatically in defense of their homeworld, even limiting the use of <a class="createlink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFighters">Space Fighters</a> because they perceived them as a waste of lives and couldn't make ones capable of competing with the Centauri's anyway. In spite of numberical inferiority, the Abbai held long enough for the Centauri Republic to to win the war and use the vastly superior numbers and skills of the Royal Navy and non-Torra militias to force House Torra and its allies to give up.
</li><li> The Rogolon, who get invaded by the Centauri because their space allows them to bypass the frontline and strike at the Orieni rear, are firmly on the Warrior side, even compared to the Drazi: they have powerfully built warships but refuse to mount <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheBullet">interception-capable weapons</a> because they find avoiding a strike is cowardly, and start all battles by giving out individual challenges (for comparison, Drazi ships are built to dodge enemy attacks and intercept what they can, and prefer to just rush the enemy without giving them time to organize). Predictably, the Centauri (and their Drazi mercenaries) <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">crushed them so hard</a> the only reason the Rogolon weren't annexed was <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWorthKilling">the Centauri decided not to spare the manpower to occupy their worlds</a>.
</li><li> The Drakh are firmly on the Soldier side compared to everyone, convincing House Torra to not support the Centauri war effort and influencing House Syma (then the strongest Centauri Great House) to the point that when the emperor died in an aircar accident (that investigations revealed caused by a genuine software flaw no Centauri could exploit-but the Drakh could) they launched a coup, feigning submission to the Orieni (who, as worshipers of the Vorlon, were automatically enemies) and pledging military forces just to get them to make an offensive that failed precisely because of the lack of Drakh support, and even sacrificing the world they used as base as the time just to weaken the Orieni more (being actually a space-based race, the actual damage was minimal).
</li><li> The Minbari, finally, are again the Warriors for the same reasons detailed above. Given their technological superiority they could have forced an end to the war at any time but refused to take part, limiting their involvement to threats of utter devastation if the Centauri or the Orieni violated their neutrality (both nations wisely accepted their conditions, with the Centauri reining in anyone stupid enough to even <em>propose</em> to use Minbari space to bypass the fortified border systems).

And I know our strengths. <br/><strong>Emsger:</strong> How do we hide an army? <br/><strong>Iguiomerus:</strong> We build ramparts along the tree-line. We've done it before. It'll be too late before they see us. We can slaughter them all.

He has the mindset and outlook of a warrior and is more interested in plunder and slaughter than conquering land, but, much like Genghis Khan several centuries later, he shapes the Huns into an army with the organization to field large siege engines, enabling him to sack cities and fortresses that were previously almost impregnable to opponents such as Arminius.

However, taking a cue from the Warrior type, Peacekeepers are trained from birth to their militarized discipline and respect for the chain of command.

While the Luxans feature a warrior-like culture emphasizing personal honor and feting ancestral victories and melee weapons (their signature weapon is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MorphWeapon">broadsword that converts to a pulse rifle</a>), when we're shown Luxan combatants besides D'argo in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrandFinale">Grand Finale</a>, they actually fight in a militarized manner, concentrating on their objective rather than personal glory.

<ul><li> The reason for this is that the Scarrans are naturally of a lower intelligence level than most other races. Their elite consume a special plant (somehow identical to Earth's strelitzia; possibly brought from Earth by the Eidolons) that boosts their intelligence, but there isn't nearly enough for everyone, which is why their soldiers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle">Dumb Muscle</a> and why they're forced to utilize other races.

<ul><li> In the DVD extras there are segments on the history and legends of Westeros, which serve to flesh out the back story of the series. The one where Stannis Baratheon discusses the failed rebellion of House Greyjoy and the rest of the Ironborn against the kingdom discusses this trope at length, talking about how the warrior lust for glory of the Ironborn was used against them.
<div class="indent"><em>"I set a trap for the Iron Fleet off of Fair Isle. As sailors and warriors the Ironborn are unparalleled, but they're not soldiers.

</div></li><li> Another strong example is the contrast between war buddies Robert Baratheon (warrior) and Ned Stark (soldier). Robert truly loved war and fighting, while Ned just saw it as a grim task and clearly does not have fond memories of it.
</li><li> At one point, King in the North Robb Stark orders his vassal (and uncle) Edmure Tully to hold the line against the forces of the Mountain while Robb campaigns in the west. Eager for glory and not content to fight a defensive war, Edmure goes on the attack and captures an enemy-held mill.

He initially works with the Romans to protect his people. When a glory seeking Roman officer wants him to fight an unrelated enemy, he refuses. After being enslaved and becoming a Gladiator, he fights to survive and for his freedom, rather than the glory other gladiators, such as Crixus, strive for.

For all their initial technological superiority the Goa'uld approach war as an exercise in self-aggrandizement, and their armies are warriors fighting for the glory of their gods. The Tau'ri, meanwhile, are modern-day Earth humans who bring to the table an industrialized military machine and fight to achieve specific objectives, innovating as needed. This difference is specifically called out in "The Warrior" by way of comparing the two sides' main weapons:

This contrasts with Starfleet, who fight only when they're forced into it; Starfleet prefers to think of itself as an exploration service first rather than a military. However, Starfleet's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHelpTheHelpless">We Help the Helpless</a> attitude eventually forged an alliance when one Starfleet ship tried to fight off <em>four</em> enemy Romulan ships to save a Klingon outpost. They all died, but the act of courage impressed the Klingons enough to end decades of animosity.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine">Deep Space Nine</a></em>, the Jem'Hadar are an interesting hybrid of the two, with a shift in perspective depending on which Alpha/Beta Quadrant nation they're being contrasted with:
<ul><li> To the Federation Starfleet, the Jems are Warriors. They are literally born knowing how to fight with a hyper-aggressive spirit to match, and are fully-fledged grunts within a few weeks. They have a religious devotion to the Dominion's Founders, and their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">Badass Creed</a> states that they are dead when they go into battle, with victory being the only way to reclaim their lives. They also have zero respect for any distinction between military and civilian that Starfleet would draw, and will happily exterminate entire species if so ordered.
<div class="indent"><strong><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SergeantRock">Jem'Hadar First Omet'iklan:</a></strong> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassCreed">I am First Omet'iklan, and I am dead.

Remember, victory is life.</a> <br/><strong>Chief Petty Officer Miles O'Brian:</strong> I am Chief Miles Edward O'Brien. I'm very much alive and I intend to stay that way!
</div></li><li> To the Klingons, however, the Jems are Soldiers. The Klingons have a very effective army, but they still care a lot about personal glory and honor and can come into conflict with each other when in pursuit of those goals. The Jem'Hadar, on the other hand, adhere to the Soldier's credo of discipline and obedience to a degree that seems flat-out insane: they will knowingly walk straight into their deaths without batting an eye if they are told to, because that is "the order of things." There is one depicted case of a Jem'Hadar First <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnfriendlyFire">fragging his Vorta commander</a> for maltreatment, but another First later decries this as a breakdown of discipline.

Chancellor Gowron, a politician with limited military experience who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS04E01E02TheWayOfTheWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekDeepSpaceNineS04E01E02TheWayOfTheWarrior">had previously started a war with the Cardassians</a> on <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PretextForWar">a flimsy pretext</a> in an attempt to gain credibility as a leader of warriors, begins to become jealous of General Martok, a common-born man who has been a fighter most of his adult life (having started as a common soldier who was ennobled for achievements in the field). Gowron starts ordering Martok into counterproductive frontal assaults and then belittling him as a coward when Martok points out the likely-unsustainable casualty rates (especially since, for <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Technobabble">technobabble</a> reasons, the Klingons are the only one of the three primary Allied combatants who can safely fight the Dominion-allied Breen). <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">Worf ends up killing Gowron in a duel and proclaiming Martok the new chancellor.</span>

Despite the Clans being a faction of humanity who embraces battle, having <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LostTechnology">superior technology</a>, a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">highly militarized culture</a>, and with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies">genetically enhanced soldiers</a>, the clans are more like honorable combatants, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">fighting for individual glory and honor</a>. The Inner Sphere, though less unified and with inferior mechs and technology, fights like <em>soldiers,</em> and manage to trick the clans multiple times into ambushes, one-sided routs, and more. At one point, a Clan fighter pilot pauses after damaging an Inner Sphere pilot, to salute her... and then gets blown out of the sky by the Inner Sphere pilot.
<ul><li> In-Universe, the senior commander of Com-Star forces comments (after routing the Clans at Tukkayid) that although each individual Clan warrior is better, and uses superior equipment, the Clans as a whole have spent centuries in what amounted to gladiatorial games with limited civilian fallout while the Inner Sphere factions spent <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar">centuries of total war</a> trying to extinguish each other. This resulted in Clan leaders that could win any <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePeterPrinciple">individual engagement but were totally unprepared</a> to fight a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure">campaign lasting more than a few days</a>.
</li><li> The Battle of Tukkayid itself was a resounding example of this trope in action, as the majority of the victories the Clans won in the battle were due to "un-Clan-like" tactics such as Clan Jade Falcon using the unorthodox Falcon Guards who fought with Inner Sphere style tactics. Clan Wolf simply discarded the normal Clan-like emphasis on quick and brutal fights and prepared for a long, drawn-out battle in which they outright suspended <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DuelToTheDeath">batchalls</a></em> and other forms of honorable combat, especially after witnessing this very thing getting the Steel Vipers virtually annihilated when the defending Comstar units <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">baited them with challenges that goaded them into charging into traps and deadly terrain.</a> The Clans that fought like warriors generally inflicted heavy losses due to the superiority of their Mechs and pilots, but were outmaneuvered strategically by the Comstar armies.
</li><li> However, the Inner Sphere does get some of the Warrior traits depending on the Great House — <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JapanTakesOverTheWorld">House Kurita</a> values "honor", and many commanders emphasize melee combat even when it's disadvantageous. That said, even they are not so foolish as the Clans in that regard: the armed forces of the Draconis Combine (the realm that House Kurita rules) were victorious at the Battle of Wolcott, where <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Clan Smoke Jaguar</a> forces were defeated with Inner Sphere subterfuge specifically exploiting the Clan rules of engagement.
</li><li> Referred to by name in a speech in the novel <em>Bred For War</em>.
</li><li> The Hell's Horses are the only faction among the Clans that espouse a lot more Soldier traits than Warrior. Their philosophy is based on "man comes before the machine", in which the individual soldier is valued over whichever tool of warfare he chooses. Specifically, there is little to no discrimination between their military and civilian castes as their philosophy plants them as an integral part of the greater whole of the Clan. Moreover, the Hell's Horses place less emphasis on the strength of the BattleMech and more on the conventional vehicles and infantry in regards to the centuries-old approach of combined arms warfare. While this philosophy comes off as rather unorthodox and quaint by the other Clans, the Hell's Horses have surprisingly thrived with this approach throughout the later passing centuries and maintained effective stability in their society even as the other supposedly 'superior' Clans have outpaced them with their traditional "BattleMech over others" approach to warfare.
</li><li> The Star Adders, while much more warrior-like in individual outlook, were founded on the principle of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">Combat Pragmatism</a>. As a result, while they still fight as warriors, their armies put a soldier-like emphasis on groundwork, military intelligence and preparation into any individual campaign. Notably, during the planned Clan invasion of the Inner Sphere the Star Adders were the only clan who had done wargames using Inner Sphere tactics and made a long-term plan for the logistics needed to realistically take and hold the Inner Sphere, and during the Great Refusal that ended the Clan threat for good Clan Star Adder won their trial by ambushing tactics, which the Inner Sphere had been completely unprepared for.

The Necrons are unthinking constructs with little in the way of a warrior culture, but are fanatically determined to slay every living thing they can get their metal hands on.
</li><li> Warriors would be the Orks and Eldar. The Eldar have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturedBadass">warrior culture that has been refined over thousands of years, and view war as just as much an art form as painting or singing</a> — though this doesn't keep them from <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">fighting dirty</a>, and indeed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingRace">Dying Race</a> they prefer to. As for da Orks, even the runtiest of boyz thinks WAAAGH!!! is a bloody good larf, while the only guiding principle in Ork society is that <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight">Might Makes Right</a>.
</li><li> Within the Orks, this is what separates mainstream Boyz from those who join the Stormboyz. These lads have a strange preoccupation with marching around in uniforms, military discipline, and attempts to gather battlefield intelligence beyond the direction to the nearest enemy. Other Orks shake their heads at such eccentricities, but put up with the Stormboyz since they're decent assault troops — plus it's always amusing when one of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack">Jet Packs</a> blows up!
</li><li> Though there are exceptions, broadly speaking Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines are the Soldiers and Warriors, respectively. Space Marines are highly regimented and disciplined, are <em>nominally</em> united under the umbrella of the Imperium, are all-rounders with a slight emphasis on shooting, and are nearly impossible to remove from the battlefield by failing morale. Chaos Space Marines, on the other hand, are vicious but less disciplined, more often than not organized into nomadic warbands, capable of being all-rounders but have an emphasis on melee, and with the exception of the most fanatical worshipers of Chaos will flee if they are losing. It's worth mentioning that Space Marines have access to the Imperium's superior technology, and can bring to bear weapons and wargear that Chaos Marines simply don't have access to. The same is also true in reverse, with some Chaos Marines having exotic weapons and war machines, but these are built by exploiting Chaotic influences, including Daemons.
<ul><li> As for the variations, Space Marines, for instance, bear a resemblance to knightly chivalric orders more than a traditional army but exactly where they fall depends on the chapter: for example, the Ultramarines with their hyper-adherence to the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBookOfWar">Codex Astartes</a></em> rules of organization and tactics are more like soldiers, whereas the Vikings <span class="font-s"><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace">IN SPACE!</a></span> Space Wolves and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> Black Templars more resemble warriors. For Chaos, forces such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Black Legion</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionOfEvil">Word Bearers</a> are more Soldier than Warrior as they remain at least fairly well-disciplined, coherent, and focused; while forces such as the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseFreak" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SenseFreak">Emperor's Children</a> and the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">World Eaters</a> are pure Warriors, demonstrated by these two quickly splintering into numerous small forces and fight by throwing themselves at the enemy because they love the bloodshed.
</li><li> Despite the above, the supreme leader of the Black Legion, Abaddon the Despoiler, had been much more of a Warrior than a Soldier in past rules editions. He is arguably the most powerful close-quarters combatants in the game, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization">but that was it</a>. Unlike most commanders, he had no support abilities to help his army. His current has alleviated this somewhat, but his biggest strength remains to be that he's one of the meanest things in melee.
</li><li> There's also the distinction between the Space Marines and the Custodes, the Emperor's personal troops and bodyguards. While the Marines place great pride in fighting "as brothers" with different specialists supporting each other, the Custodes fight as individual warriors. On a few occasions this has led to Marine characters completely losing respect for them, even thought the Custodes were cutting through enemies like paper.
</li></ul></li><li> The Tyranids are surprisingly Soldier-like. While their only motivation is to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HordeOfAlienLocusts">eat the galaxy and multiply</a> and one might think they'd be Warriors due to their use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZergRush">Zerg Rush</a> (they were the zerg before <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft">the actual zerg</a> were), on the battlefield they rely heavily on the centralized coordination of their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind">Hive Mind</a>, to the point where one of the most effective ways to deal with their ground forces is killing the larger "synapse creatures" that act like psychic radio repeaters in order to strip the swarm of its leadership. During invasions they also pre-prepare the battlefield often decades or centuries ahead of time by infiltrating genestealers into planetary populations, rather like a normal army might use covert operations forces to weaken a target before deploying the main army, and they use fairly sophisticated tactics while they fight.

<ul><li> In a full meta-perspective, the Soldier represents the Lawful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment">alignments</a> while the Warrior represents the Chaotic alignments.
</li><li> The Paladin typically fills the role of the Soldier to a "tee," both in form and in theory, being restricted to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LawfulGood">Lawful Good</a> alignment only; the Antipaladin, therefore, fills the role of the Warrior, as it's required to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticEvil">Chaotic Evil</a> — Paladins often act as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCape">The Cape</a>, while Antipaladins are typically either <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon">dragons</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad">Big Bads</a> themselves.
<ul><li> A more benign pair of examples are the Monk, who is restricted to any of the Lawful Alignments, and the Barbarian, who cannot be Lawful (and are typically therefore played as one of the Chaotic alignments). While the Monk supports its teammates and strives for personal enlightenment, the Barbarian <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">typically keeps count of the bodies it wracks up before anything else</a>. However, either can be a hero, villain, or somewhere in between.
</li></ul></li><li> In D&amp;D 4E, this was invoked with the enemy roles of Brute (warrior) and Soldier. Additionally, certain PC classes or builds might fall to one side or the other, such as the Barbarian being a warrior while most classes in the Defender role are soldiers (except the Fighter class which could fall either way depending on build).
</li><li> This is the main difference between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent">hobgoblins</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurOrcsAreDifferent">orcs</a>. While both are aggressively warlike, hobgoblins are known for their organization and discipline, whereas orcs are far more savage and wild.

In Carth's view, a soldier's job is to protect the defenseless, and they usually have to fight conquering <em>warriors</em>. In contrast, Canderous' people the Mandalorians are a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChallengeSeeker">culture where one constantly seeks to test one's strength</a> against the strongest possible opponent (which they see as the Republic and its Jedi peacekeepers, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthInsult">which is why they're usually allied to the Sith</a>), and committed multiple genocides in the most recent war to provoke the Republic to fight them. The Republic ended up winning a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PyrrhicVictory">Pyrrhic Victory</a> (the circumstances are elaborated in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublicIITheSithLords">the sequel</a>) that led directly to the current Sith War after several of the Jedi Knights who left to fight fell to the dark side. It was implied Revan <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExploitedTrope">exploited</a> the Mandalorian tendency to go full-strength into any fight by tricking them into feints and exhausting their resources by cruel use of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>.
</li><li> This also applies to the distant sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsTheOldRepublic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a>.</em> The Republic? Soldier through and through. One of the classes you can play is the commander of a special forces unit, and several companion characters of the other classes are also military-based. The Imperial equivalent? The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter">Bounty Hunter</a>, a warrior for hire. (And following in the path of the Carth and Canderous argument above, the Hunter can choose to join the Mandalorians). The Republic takes a lot of heat for being "slow," and "inefficient," but they have a larger population, better infrastructure, and a functional (though far from perfect) government. The Imperials and their Sith leadership are certainly warriors, with a culture of ruthless survival and self-advancement, led by their <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AxCrazy">Ax-Crazy</a> theocratic cabal of Sith, with a massive hit of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChronicBackstabbingDisorder">Chronic Backstabbing Disorder</a>.

So, yes, the average Imperial would be able to defeat the average Republic counterpart. It also leaves them with fewer <em>experienced</em> officers, Force Users, soldiers, scientists, etc. The officer can't trust his underlings (who may be out to murder him for advancement). The underlings can't trust their commanders (who may be advancing himself by sending them into a slaughter). Worse is that the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan">Only Sane Man</a>, their Intelligence Services, get very little respect.

</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MassEffect">Mass Effect</a></em>, the two different types are reflected in the turian and the krogan races, both examples of a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRace">Proud Warrior Race</a> but in two distinct flavors:
<ul><li> Turians are extremely disciplined, organized, and collectivist soldiers. They boast the most powerful navy in the galaxy, and every turian is expected to serve in the military once they come of age. Even those that aren't currently serving are taught the importance of following orders, performing your duties earnestly, and both understanding and following protocol. Even their civilian society is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a> in structure.
</li><li> Krogan are walking <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBerserker">Berserkers</a>, each one boasting nearly unparalleled strength and toughness. Their culture is extremely <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialDarwinist">Darwinian</a>, with the weak culled either by natural dangers or battle, and leaders typically chosen through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">Asskicking Equals Authority</a>. They make perfect infantry and shock troops, but with an unpredictable and unreliable nature. Their extremely long lifespan and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveBreeder">high fertility</a> meant that they could afford to fight wars of attrition. <br/><br/>In the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreatOffscreenWar">Great Offscreen War</a> in the franchise backstory, the turians entered galactic society while the krogan were threatening to overrun the standing government. The turians implemented a countermeasure, the infamous <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepopulationBomb">Genophage</a> (designed by others who weren't actually intending the turians to use it), which removed their primary strength (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves">We Have Reserves</a>). Latter-era krogan have adopted more soldier-like traits, emphasizing the battlemaster's leadership and cooperation within the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions">krantt</a>. It's understood that not every krogan can be the best warrior, but every krogan has to have friends who'll fight by his side.
</li><li> Among the other major Citadel races, the asari are closest to the Warrior, with their focus on elite biotic commandos and the lawkeeper tradition of the justicars. They also have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeudalFuture">Feudal Future</a> approach to military requisitions (this despite being governed by e-democracy), with each individual asari republic equipping their commando units and militias from its own funds rather than a single national budget. This results in a chaotic variety of capabilities as a national military, which was among several factors in the rapid fall of asari space to the Reapers, whereas the more organized humans and turians were able to slow their advances on Earth and Palaven for months. On the other hand, the locally-supplied weaponry and powerful individual warriors meant that while an asari world could be conquered, <em>holding</em> it after the conventional military was defeated would be a nightmare due to the ensuing insurgency.
</li><li> The salarians don't fit neatly anywhere on the spectrum. Like soldiers, they avoid direct combat as much as necessary and focus on winning the intelligence war so they can rapidly and surgically defeat any adversary almost before the war starts. At the same time, their military has no concept of "peacetime" and "wartime" (in fact, they consider Declarations of War immensely stupid, there's a saying that the Salarians only declare war when they have already won or crippled beyond repair the enemy forces), so their intelligence/espionage wars are fought around the clock. They take it upon themselves to deal with threats that other races either don't know about or can't publicly attack; previous persons of interest have a habit of dying from accidents or natural causes, or disappearing outright. This also means that they are constantly trying to maintain a military advantage against <em>everyone</em>, including their "allies".
</li><li> Meanwhile the Systems Alliance (the main human government) are essentially soldiers and use largely 21st century Earth doctrines ported to space, complete with fighter carriers <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoopholeAbuse">to get around Citadel restrictions on dreadnought construction</a>. Instead of garrisoning each individual planet, the Alliance stations fleets at strategic mass relays so they can effectively defend a larger volume of space with fewer ships (but as observed in the novel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MassEffectRevelation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MassEffectRevelation">Mass Effect: Revelation</a></em>, this comes at the cost of slower response time). Only a small fraction of the human population serves in the military, but they make up for it with drone and mech support.
</li><li> Both the quarians and the geth are Soldiers. The entire quarian race turns itself into a navy with all the collectivist doctrine, chain of command and professionalism that comes with it. The geth mobile platform and runtime architecture is structured such that a few run times might be performing asteroid mining on mobile platforms one day, then operate a dreadnought a different day.
</li><li> The soldier vs warrior dynamic is shown during the Priority Tuchanka mission. The soldiers Shepard, Victus, and Mordin (or Wiks) plan a complicated operation in which Krogan ground forces in Tomkah tanks and Turian fighters launch a combined assault on a Reaper to distract it, while a small team sneaks around it to the Shroud to release the genophage cure. Problem is, the warrior Krogans comprising the ground assault team don't do some basic soldierly tasks, such as ingress route planning, maintaining comms with the fighter wing to coordinate the assault properly, or having contingency plans in case the initial ingress got stalled (things are probably not helped by the fact that the turians and krogan had few reasons to be friends and many reasons not to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyMine">before the Reaper invasion</a>). As expected, the combined assault comes undone; the ground attack convoy gets bogged down when a single road gets taken out, but the turian fighters stick to the original plan and attack regardless.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar">Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War</a></em> bases its <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter">Karma Meter</a> on this dichotomy, although it further splits the Warrior into two more archetypes: Mercenary (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney">Only in It for the Money</a>) and Knight (<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker">Glory Seeker</a>). You conduct on the battlefield decides which type you'll be assigned to, which in turn determines which bosses you face.

On the soldier end we have Doctor Harza-Kull, an Orion, and Lieutenant Commander Tarol, CMO and chief engineer respectively and who both view "honor" more along the lines of professionalism. On the other end is the tactical officer LCDR. Hark, a straight <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GloryHound">Glory Hound</a> implied to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarscream">have his eye on Captain Koren's job</a>.

Nords hail from the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrimUpNorth">Grim Up North</a> province of Skyrim where they <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HadToBeSharp">Had to Be Sharp</a> merely to establish a culture in the first place. Culturally, they exhibit <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> tendencies and will often put <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason">Honor Before Reason</a>. Being a great warrior is even at the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealMenLoveJesus">heart of their religion</a>, where only those who die a glorious death in combat get into their ideal afterlife, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarriorHeaven">Sovngarde</a> (modeled after the real life Valhalla). Redguards meanwhile, are some of the finest swordsmen on the continent, being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CultureChopSuey">cultural mix-up of the samurai and the Moors</a>, but also possess an adventurous streak that makes them better as mercenaries, pirates, and adventurers than as rank-and-file soldiers. Where the "soldier" aspect of this trope comes into play is with the Imperial race, who are very much the "soldiers" to the Nord/Redguard "warriors." The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassArmy">Imperial Legions</a> have helped to forge <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">three Empires</a> from their homeland of Cyrodiil throughout history, conquering much or all of Tamriel in each case. They have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture">heavy basis</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AncientRome">Ancient Rome</a>, utilizing similar strategies and tactics as the real world Roman Legions. Imperials also focus less on the glories of the combat itself, and more on the glories achieved <em>through</em> combat (such as building their Empires).
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em>, this is the dynamic between the Imperial Legion (Soldiers) and the Stormcloaks (Warriors). The Imperials are often seen training and performing drills, and possess uniform equipment. The Stormcloaks are basically more free-spirited and less disciplined, and there is more variety in weapons they wield — Imperial troops usually have a (Roman Gladius inspired) Imperial Sword as standard, but Stormcloaks can be armed with swords and axes of one or two-handed varieties. It also reflects in their performance in battle: a lone Stormcloak vs. a lone Imperial usually results in a Stormcloak win, but a bunch of Stormcloaks vs. a bunch of Imperials tends to be a more even fight. Also, the Imperials are unquestionably the better archers, with better bows and greater accuracy.

<ul><li> The NCR are the most obvious "soldier" faction, having based their government and military on the model of pre-apocalypse USA. The NCR is noted to have tons of money, greater numbers, and better equipment at their disposal.
<ul><li> After them, other "soldier"-type factions include the Brotherhood of Steel and the Enclave. Both, not coincidentally, also being remnants of pre-apocalypse American military.
</li><li> Mr. House's robot army is also on the "soldier" side, with the robots' TV screen faces even changing from police officers to soldiers once you upgrade them. Mr. House even has a military-style testing center that looks like a training course in the basement of his Lucky 38 casino. Of course this isn't that surprising, given that they are robots, and are thus programmed to to follow Mr. House's orders and fulfill his cause.
</li></ul></li><li> Caesar's Legion is the most apparent "warrior" faction, even though their culture is modeled upon the disciplined, professional Roman Legions. Legion soldiers aren't much for individual tactics beyond <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">Attack! Attack! Attack!</a>, and they tend to carry much more primitive equipment compared to other factions. Legionaries are also encouraged to show their strength and courage in battle, as seniority means nothing and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsskickingEqualsAuthority">rewards are given based solely on merit</a>.
<ul><li> The <em>majority</em> of other combatant cultures also follow a warrior culture, including the Fiends, the Great Khans, the Jackals, the Vipers, and so-forth.
</li></ul></li><li> The Boomers are kind of a mix of the two. Despite being settled inside of an Air Force Base, and equipped with all sorts of destructive pre-War tech, they have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadBomber">fanatical reverence</a> for explosives and <em>gleefully</em> use them when given half an excuse.

The Norn value personal accomplishments and bravery over anything else. They do not have armies but instead venture out alone or with a few close companions if the enemy is worthy prey. The Charr by comparison place an emphasis on unity, placing the warband and Legion above personal interest. Rather than clashing over these differing viewpoints, the Charr and Norn respect each other for their adherence to honor.
<ul><li> A good comparison on this outlook can be seen in the <em>Eye of the North</em> campaign. Recruiting the Charr requires killing their current corrupt leaders, at which point the Legions quickly realign under their new leader. Recruiting the Norn involves a spirit journey and showing one rather boisterous Norn that the enemy is fun to hunt and there are enough to gather a hunting party.
</li></ul></li><li> In World of Warcraft, the Alliance army is composed of soldiers, and the Horde's is composed of warriors.
</li><li> A common dynamic seen across the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FireEmblem">Fire Emblem</a></em> series:
<ul><li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionHero">Martial Lord</a> archetype plays the Warrior to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartialPacifist">Peaceful Lord</a>'s Soldier. Martial Lords are passionate about conquest in the battlefield, either out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">personal satisfaction</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDeterminator">determination to achieve their goals</a>. Meanwhile, Peaceful Lords are often <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantWarrior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReluctantWarrior">reluctant to fight</a>, doing so because it's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolenceIsTheOnlyOption">the only solution to the conflict they're faced with</a>. In terms of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a>, Martial Lords have a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FatalFlaw">Fatal Flaw</a> in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeeroyJenkins">their recklessness</a>, and learn to think about their actions by the end of the game; meanwhile, Peaceful Lords become less naive and more intellegent over the course of the game, while still maintaining the values that drive them to fight.
</li><li> Fighters play the Warrior to the Knight's Soldier. The former fights out of passion and might serve a Lord out of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits">happenstance</a>, whereas the latter takes a vow to fight on behalf of their Lord. Knights wear heavy armor that only a state-sponsored army could afford, whereas Fighters charge into battle with only an axe and the clothes on their back. Fighters may even promote to a class named "Warrior".
</li><li> Myrmidons play the Warrior to the Mercenary's Soldier. The former are dedicated practitioners of the sword, seeking to become masters of the art, whereas the latter uses the sword as a means to an end (which, as their class name implies, is usually to make a living).
</li><li> For (typically) enemy-exclusive classes, Brigands plays the Warrior to, well, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShapedLikeItself">Soldiers</a>. The former are fought as nebulous gangs, scaling mountains and ransacking villages, whereas the latter serve <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire">The Empire</a> and are <em>supposed</em> to defend said villages. The two both play <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGoomba">The Goomba</a>, but for different reasons: Brigands are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnskilledButStrong">very strong but can't reliably strike their opponents</a>, whereas Soldiers are <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannonFodder">Cannon Fodder</a> that struggle against even sword wielders.

Maps on this route tend to be open fields and fortifications which offer minimal cover and the enemy forces are usually similar in composition to the player's own. This forces players to stay in formation to protect their squishier units and avoid being flanked. Celica's route emphasizes the warrior philosophy. The story is about a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagTagBunchOfMisfits">Rag Tag Bunch Of Misfits</a> on a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionFromGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionFromGod">Mission from God</a> and the party has a preponderance of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlassCannon">Mages</a>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JackOfAllStats">Mercenaries</a>, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FragileSpeedster">Pegasus Knights</a>.

He and his army were defeated by a barbarian army of warriors which easily overpowered the Spartan's training and discipline with individual battle prowess and savage ferocity to the point that Kratos' army was slaughtered to the last and Kratos himself only survived by selling his soul to Ares who made him the most powerful warrior on the planet.

<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>,</em> this is the dynamic between the Fire Nation and Water Tribes. The Fire Nation prides itself in its highly structured and professional military. Their soldiers are uniformly equipped and are all about obeying the chain of command, and they fight for the purpose of serving the Fire Lord. For the Water Tribes, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy">warriorhood is the heart of their culture</a>. They are more free spirited in that while one is expected to respect those above their station, all warriors are expected to demonstrate leadership and initiative, and their unique talents are often a valuable contribution. This is especially true in the Northern Water Tribe, where the wisdom of a fellow warrior must be considered. Water Tribe warriors tend to fight with a variety of skills and weaponry, but have a tendency to charge into fights recklessly. By <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, the Northern Water Tribe eventually phased out their warrior caste in favor of adopting a professional military, while the Southern Water Tribe are still more warrior-like as they were in the Hundred Year War.

</li></ul></li><li> Roman legions versus native warriors, such as Gauls, Celts, and Germans. The Romans are well-known as one of the first states to create a professional army with carefully codified tactics and organization, whereas nearly all of their opponents relied on calling up native militias. It initially went well for the Romans in most cases, but one of the things that stopped the Roman Empire's expansion was because they ran out of rich opponents to steamroll and pillage with their (very expensive) superior army. Political infighting and looming economical bankruptcy eventually sent the Western half of the empire on a path to self-destruction and the "barbarians" moved in to pick up the pieces in the 5th century. <br/><br/>The Germanic tribes also famously handed Rome one of the worst military defeats in its history in 9 CE at the <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>. The overconfident Roman governor Publius Quinctilius Varus, spurred on by Arminius, a Roman-educated German who was spying for the tribes, led three legions, auxiliaries, and cavalry into thick woods and weather (it was pouring down rain) that favored the lightly equipped Germanic warriors. Arminius used the tribes' strength to hit the weaknesses in Roman tactics, hitting various parts of the Roman line in <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a> through the woods. When the dust settled, over 16,000 Romans were dead or enslaved (Varus included; <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DecapitationPresentation">Arminius sent his head to another chief in [vain] hopes of securing an alliance</a>) and the Empire had lost control of everything east of the Rhine. On the flipside, in an ensuing reprisal campaign a Roman army managed to bring the Germans to battle in open field combat, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">the Romans' best terrain</a>, and Arminius was later assassinated due to tribal politics.
<ul><li> An interesting twist is that, compared to other cultures the Romans interacted with, they themselves often appeared to fall into the warrior role more often, despite their use of a professional standing army. One comparison would be the Romans and the various Greek city-states, especially during the Hellenistic period where the Roman Republic began to come into conflict with the Greeks. The difference in connotations can also be seen in the characterization of Ares versus Mars. While more popular in Sparta, most often Ares was seen as the embodiment of the negative aspects of war, whereas Mars (helped by origins as an agricultural deity as well) was seen as more positive. And complicating it further, the Spartans again interpreted Ares more favorably (though in different ways compared to how the Romans viewed Mars) and are typically perceived as the odd one out among the various ancient Greek city-states, being interpreted more as Warriors.
</li></ul></li><li> The Mongols are often characterized as a barbarous example of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHorde">The Horde</a>, but in truth <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/GenghisKhan">Genghis Khan</a> organized them into a professional army of soldiers, a highly-trained, -regimented, -motivated, and therefore highly-effective fighting force. <a class="urllink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_military_tactics_and_organization">The Other Wiki explains.<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>
<ul><li> The 13th century Mongol invasion of Europe illustrates this. Though a European knight was no less a fighter than his Mongol counterpart, the Mongols had superior organization, discipline and tactics. The knightly approach to warfare, i.e. a glorious headlong charge, made them nearly helpless against the Mongol <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseArcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorseArcher">Horse Archers</a>' use of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefensiveFeintTrap">Defensive Feint Trap</a> and other <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitAndRunTactics">Hit-and-Run Tactics</a>. It also helped a lot Subudei, Baidar and Batu were the most brilliant generals of the era — the later Mongol generals were not up to their par.
</li></ul></li></ul><dl><dd><ul><li> Similarly, the Japanese considered the Mongols to be barbaric opponents because <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Samurai">Samurai</a> tactics at the time were mostly about individuals finding an opponent to duel before moving on to the next honorable contest. Mongol tactics were all about <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CombatPragmatist">killing as many of the enemy as possible as efficiently and indiscriminately as possible</a>.
</li><li> In China, the southern Song Dynasty actually held out against the Mongols until the Battle of Xiangyang in 1273, when the Mongol Empire had expanded all the way into Eastern Europe and the Middle East. It helped that the Song kept a standing, professional army rather than a feudal levy, making it a case of Soldiers vs. Soldiers.
</li></ul></dd></dl><ul><li> This is often the distinction made between <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/YanksWithTanks">the US Army</a> and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SemperFi">the US Marine Corps</a>, to the point that it's considered an insult to call a Marine a "soldier". Further, commanders of Army soldiers don't like elite groups like the SEALs, Rangers or Delta Force hanging out with their men, because soldiers tend to start trying to emulate them by improvising instead of keeping cover and formation, compromising the entire operation.
</li><li> Generally (but not always) colonial forces versus natives, respectively — particularly US Army versus Native Americans, and the British versus Dervishes, Afghans, and most African groups (but technically not the Zulus, who also had an organized army). Exceptions largely prove the rule; after victories such as the Little Bighorn and the Monongahela, native forces were typically disorganized or shattered by casualties, and failed to follow up. This enabled the Europeans to come back later and clean up the pieces — "punitive expeditions" were innumerable in the colonial era.
</li><li> Native American auxiliaries vs. Scottish Highlanders, on the same side. The native warriors would find it difficult to replace their numbers, and thought that any deaths were a failure. For this reason, they refused to do very dangerous jobs. By contrast, Scottish Highlanders were perfectly happy to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackAttackAttack">charge straight into musket fire</a>; they'd lose a few, but they'd slaughter the enemy in the ensuing close combat, and their professional status meant casualties could be replaced. As a result, the Scots thought the Americans were <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCoward">cowards</a>, while the Americans thought the Scots had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FearlessFool">deathwish</a>.
</li><li> In 16th-17th century Russian there was actually a semantic difference between old-style Warriors and new-style Soldiers (Soldaty, using the Saxon word for 'soldier') which quite neatly mirrored the real distinctions in recruitment and training between the two. Needless to say, and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cossacks" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Cossacks">Cossacks</a> aside, the Soldaty triumphed as the age of Gunpowder Warfare went on.
<ul><li> It is also neatly demonstrated in colonial warfare. The Cossack bands did pretty well in the initial clashes with the Siberian natives, but then they were actually a rather well ordered force compared to the most of the natives. But when the task turned to actually <em>administrating</em> the conquered lands, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MildlyMilitary">Mildly Military</a> Cossacks turned out rather inefficient, as they were more interested in living off the lands and often ended up needlessly brutalizing the locals, which is why the regular troops were brought in instead.
</li></ul></li><li> The <a class="urllink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oka_Crisis">Oka Crisis<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a>, one of the most famous post-confederation conflicts between the Canadian government and Native tribes (started in 1986 over a land dispute). Famously captured in <a class="urllink" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1f/Oka_stare_down.jpg">this picture<img height="12" src="https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/external_link.gif" style="border:none;" width="12"/></a><small>◊</small> of a Mohawk warrior and a Canadian soldier of the Royal 22nd Regiment staring each other down.
</li><li> Team sports (the Soldiers) vs. individual sports (the Warriors).
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII">World War II</a> could be considered a case study on this. Despite all combatants technically being soldiers, the Axis powers tended to ideologically shift closer to warrior while the Allies were firmly on the side of soldier. Fascist and Nazi ideas of war were all about having a glorious triumph over the enemy or a glorious death. Japan based their war effort around the samurai way of life or rather the Hollywood version of it. Their training was more about mentally preparing their combatants how to kill. By contrast the Western allies propaganda was all about making the Axis problem go away so that they could live in peace. Their training often ignored making combatants ready for war and instead focused on working as a group and other useful skills <span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note629vk');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note629vk" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note629vk');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;"> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot">Saburo Sakai</a> wrote of this, stating specifically that while individual Japanese pilots tended to be better-trained and highly skilled as individual pilots, their near-complete lack of team tactics was one of the main contributors to their defeat in the air. For instance in the early years of the Pacific theatre, the Japanese Zeroes were superior dogfighting planes to American ones of that time, but the US Navy air tactical genius, John Thache, developed the Thache Weave, a double-team fighter defensive maneuver that could even the odds so well that Sakai himself had a close call escaping it.</span>.
<ul><li> In addition, the Axis powers treated their fighter pilots like warriors, keeping them in battle where they could do the most damage. By contrast, the Allies treated their fighters like soldiers: those who excelled in air combat were often pulled from combat duty to become <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VeteranInstructor">Veteran Instructor</a> personnel. That way, they could avoid being casualties and hurt morale, train new recruits with their experience and improve the overall standard of the air force, and perhaps encourage other pilots to excel not just for immediate survival in the field, but they could be excused sooner for that excellence.
</li><li> As for the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/SovietRussiaUkraineAndSoOn">USSR</a> it was a bit complicated. Well, the Red Army mostly wanted to be firmly on the side of soldiers. However the political side of the thing, as in most of the actual government, was simply <em>in love</em> with the idea of a "revolutionary soldier" which falls more to the side of warrior. In this idea barely trained "revolutionaries" would go out and try and rally the oppressed masses to fight for the Soviet Union against the outside threat. The concept was incredibly divorced from reality, but was politically a dangerous-to-deviate-from mainstream, and thus prevailed for the most of 20's and 30's. Only after the Soviets were dealt a number of very humiliating <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle">curb stomps</a> in the workup to the WWII proper, the political brass, including <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JosefStalin">Josef Stalin</a>, let the Red Army do its thing. Still, the Red Army itself was most emphatically <em>not</em> a monolitic structure, there's been <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether">a lot of competing concepts and approaches</a>,<span class="notelabel" onclick="togglenote('note7yax4');"><sup>note </sup></span><span class="inlinefolder" id="note7yax4" isnote="true" onclick="togglenote('note7yax4');" style="cursor:pointer;font-size:smaller;display:none;">Though not to the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyCivilWar">Japanese level</a>.</span> which is why the Warrior mindset survived right to the Nazi attack, which was one of the reasons for the initial defeats. Only then it was definitely shown to be the less efficient approach, and the Soviet Military swung very heavily to the soldier side, fighting to live against an enemy that would enslave or kill them all if triumphed.
</li></ul></li><li> Fighter pilots vs ground attack or bomber pilots also has this dynamic. Fighter pilots behave more like warriors, living for the dogfight, measuring their self worth by how many dogfights they've won, and often feeling a sense of kinship even with enemy fighter pilots who have been successful. This is best illustrated by the sheer amount of respect Baron Richtofen got, even among American and British fighter pilots. On the other hand, ground attack and bomber pilots behave more like soldiers, seeing their job as not a great adventure that brings them glory, but as a grim business that needs to be done to win the war. The sheer amount of intricate planning that goes into strike missions and even Air Support missions, further illustrates this. For example, in an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaStrike">Alpha Strike</a> on a hardened target, a fighter pilot escorting a bomber might become an Ace and feel that he had a good mission, but if that bomber ends up being shot down without destroying the target, the mission is considered failed.
<ul><li> As with most forms of warfare, the advancement of technology has turned the fighter pilots of most major militaries into functional Soldiers. They may have a reputation of being a cocky and arrogant Warrior stereotype on the ground, but when they're in the air, their job is to accomplish the mission with as few friendly casualties as possible (preferably none). Notably, modern pilots are communicating with friendly forces constantly, for better situational awareness and coordination. They often given up kills to other pilots who are better positioned to take the shot. They may even let enemy aircraft go if trying to persue the enemy involves overextending or getting out of position and putting friendly forces at risk.
</li></ul></li><li> The Arab Revolt during <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarI">World War I</a> pitted Arab tribal levies (warrior) against the military of the Ottoman Empire (soldier). Unusually for modern examples of this trope, the warriors won, though not without considerable help from Britain and France.
</li><li> The Battle of the Atlantic was a fight between Allied destroyer escorts (soldier) and German U-boats (warrior). The destroyers would act as a single unit to hunt down U-boats that would try to attack their supply convoys. The German submariners measured their success in the tonnage they had sent to the bottom of the ocean.
</li><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheWarOnTerror">The War on Terror</a> usually fits this trope. While the "terrorist" side is diverse, most combattants have been motivated by ideology, and not part of regular armed forces.
