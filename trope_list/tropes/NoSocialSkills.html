He's got a kind personality but a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceOfAThug">terrifying face</a>, which results in him being avoided by most people and thus lacking in social experience. His resulting <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckoolander">bizarre behavior</a> serves to freak people out even more in a vicious cycle. He always <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntendreFailure" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EntendreFailure">speaks extremely literally and without deceit, and assumes that everyone else around him does as well</a>, is completely unaware of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Delinquent">Delinquent</a> reputations of himself and his friends at school, and he's an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist">Actual Pacifist</a> whose reaction to physical attacks (which he usually interprets as something quite different) is to rapidly dodge and try to calm down the other person even if he has gotten noticeably injured during the attack.

</li><li> Although Yuno from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/BlackClover">Black Clover</a></em> seems cold and aloof, he's actually just quiet and has problems communicating with most people except Asta, his best friend and foster brother who he grew up with. He doesn't care about befriending any of his squadmates at first and his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty">Brutal Honesty</a> causes him to provoke some people. He does improve over time, becoming closer to his fellow Golden Dawn members like Klaus and Mimosa.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CreoTheCrimsonCrises" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/CreoTheCrimsonCrises">Creo the Crimson Crises</a></em> we have Kiki, who's never even worn shoes or underwear until she joins the main cast.

</li><li> Near is also quite awkward and seems unlikely to get by if he had to fend for himself in the normal world. Oddly, despite their practical problems, they both possess great theoretical knowledge of people. His rival Mello left the Wammy's House orphanage where they were both raised at the age of 14 and is quite street-savvy in comparison.
</li></ul></li><li> Inosuke in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DemonSlayerKimetsuNoYaiba">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></em> lived for a great of his life alone in the mountains, with only a little human interaction when he was an infant, with that he had little to no experience and knowledge of social interactions; that makes him seem quite insensitive in his early appearances, but it is progressively shown that most of it isnt done out of real malice, he really had no idea on how to be sensible towards people, from there on Tanjiro, the protagonist, becomes quite the mentor on how Inosuke develops in his empathy towards others.
</li><li> Goku in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBall">Dragon Ball</a></em> was raised by his grandfather in the wilderness until he was 12 and said grandfather died. He had been so sheltered that he never truly assimilated into society, and the division is very evident until he is an adult. The worst symptom, however, would have to be his complete inability to assess gender from sight, which leads to some <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AccidentalPervert">Accidental Perversion</a>. Bulma is the first girl he had ever seen in his life, so she gets the worst of it. His grandfather had told him to be nice to girls — but it was apparently up to himself to figure out how.
<ul><li> The sequel <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonBallZ">Dragon Ball Z</a></em> also revealed Goku is a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien">Human Alien</a> known as a Saiyan. Saiyans are revealed to be natural born fighters and usually aggressive and drawn to strength (Goku's kind heart is the result of his mother Gine and his head trauma as a baby. The other Saiyans we see, while liking companionship, function a bit differently than people do.)
</li></ul></li><li> Nana from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied">Elfen Lied</a></em> is an innocent girl raised in a lab. She knows absolutely nothing about the world outside the complex where she used to live, to the point of burning a "bunch of papers" that turned out to be money. And being gullible enough to believe that the money when kept together would attack her in her sleep.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FoodWars">Food Wars!</a></em>: Erina Nakiri. At one point, while complaining to Soma about his narrow-minded view of cooking, he completely ignores everything she has to say just to point out that she is really hard to talk to despite <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSocialExpert">his own ability to get along with others</a>. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground">She doesn't have any friends</a>, only an assistant that worships her and a cousin that likes making fun of her. Her poor social skills are a result of her father Azami intentionally isolating her as a child to have more control over her, including destroying letters to and from Alice, the closest thing she had to a friend.
</li><li> Sagara Sousuke from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FullMetalPanic">Full Metal Panic!</a></em>. He's been in the military since birth. Someone once described Sousuke as that character in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG">Tabletop RPG</a> who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinMaxing">traded in</a> all those "worthless" character points in social skills and instead put them into <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SacrificedBasicSkillForAwesomeTraining">combat abilities.</a> He is a nice guy, he just has no concept at all of what's expected of someone in a high school environment. Naturally, the writers put him in a high school environment, often. This turned out to be so popular that an entire season with this as the main premise was produced: <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullMetalPanicFumoffu">Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu</a></em>.

Having spent thirteen years of mistreatment by a cruel ringmaster, she's suspicious of everybody, detests killing, and adamantly opposed to eating meat. As such, she doesn't know how to interact with other people. She either lashes out in a rage, misunderstands others' actions, and stubbornly refuses to see beyond her calls of judgment. Worse still, she is not able to admit what her problem is and expects her friends to just "read her mind."

<ul><li> Holo matches this trope to a glimmering 'T'. She is a wolf spirit/god of the harvest. She's a lot savvier about the way humans live than the others, though. She has lived with humans several times in the past, and spent centuries watching the people of a single village. Indeed, she often understands people better than they understand themselves, and isn't above emotional manipulation when it suits her. She is carefree about certain human conventions, but not because she doesn't understand them — she just doesn't care. She also goes centuries without interacting with humans, so her social awkwardness often stems from being so out of touch with the times.
</li><li> Lawrence's social skills are quite poor as well. While he's adept at communicating at others of his trade in the process of various business deals, he doesn't have much experience with people outside of the field of economics. He's <em>especially</em> ignorant of the courtship process.
</li><li> Lawrence and Holo are good examples of different ways this trope can be applied. Lawrence knows a lot about contemporary society and social institutions, but isn't very savvy about human nature. Horo is the exact opposite, and both are intelligent enough to cover for each other as necessary.

Especially in the manga, he is often heard uttering the phrases like, "Does not compute." Of course, it's questionable if this is because Abel has an extensive vocabulary or simply because he's crazy. However, Tres also fits into the "brutal honesty" classification quite snugly.

Having been created to be and raised as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingWeapon">Living Weapons</a>, the very concept of just asking for help or for something they need rather than taking said something by force is completely alien to them.

He tends to miss social clues and be especially blunt about things, though honestly he's a very kind person. This makes sense; pre-series he had no friends and never interacted with his peer group outside of his brother Yukio (when he wasn't off being an exorcist) so it's more like his social skill level is that of an elementary school student despite being a teenager. And then there is the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSmiler">other</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurvivorGuilt">issues</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism">he</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfHisOwnKind" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HunterOfHisOwnKind">has</a> on top of that.

She's faster on the uptake than Rin at times though, being naturally extroverted underneath her shy nature and taking steps herself to move past her awkwardness.
</li><li> Yukio is a downplayed example. He's good at faking things, but most normal interactions outside of exorcist business leaves him clueless. Like not understanding he should text ahead that he's going to be late or not knowing the correct response to a joke. Understandable really, since he's always been aloof from his peer group due to being a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChildSoldier">Child Soldier</a> and previously a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet">Shrinking Violet</a>.

This means that while he is quite competent at his job and organizational affairs, he has no clue about how to deal with people.

Even Dan has problems dealing with him to the point where he finally lashes out at Rorschach. This leads to a handshake that Rorschach finds very awkward. The only time Rorschach feels at ease with anyone is when he's breaking people's fingers.

<ul><li> A great deal of the comedy comes from Jaune's almost complete naivety in regards to normal interaction. Since his only human interaction growing up was with his family and his mother's minions, he doesn't understand almost any form of slang, metaphor, or simile (a comment from Ruby about not wanting to be "the bees knees" and wanting to just be "normal knees" causes him to assume people compliment each other on their knees). Jaune frequently comes off as flirting or insulting (calling Yang pretty and offering Cardin a cookie respectively) when he's just trying to have a friendly conversation.
</li><li> Turns out that most of Jaune's sisters (except for Sapphire, the eldest) are even worse. Coral's idea of a normal social interaction is to show a man a smutty book and hop into bed with him, Lavender <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFakeCutie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFakeCutie">plays up her cuteness</a> because it lets people excuse her weird behavior, and Amber <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBeastmaster">set a flock of nevermore</a> on a boy who was making fun of her friend. Weiss dryly notes that while Jaune managed to hide at Beacon for months, his sisters barely lasted a week at a normal school.

His power of total body and mind control allows him to train his body to be the ultimate fighting machine and to focus his mind, blocking off emotions he considers unnecessary and eschewing normal human contact. When his mother visits him at Lander, she is worried that he has zero friends. The boys he hangs out with are his sparring partners, nothing more. When Angela expresses an interest in him, all her hints go right over his head, as he takes everything at face value.

Vince doesn't understand what they mean, and Nick points out that this just underscores their point. They both get better, though, with Chad even starting to come out of his shell and trying to do more with his friends than exercise and spar.

As such, he's grown up surrounded by luxury, being pandered to by everyone he meets (he's initially attracted to Blaze <em>because</em> she's the only girl he's met who doesn't immediately throw herself at his feet). Between that and his emotionless, mercenary grandfather who uses Tad as a pawn for his ambitions, it's amazing Tad is even as tactful as he is, but his tendency to blurt out questions and utter inability to read a room nearly gets him thrown off a roof. But under all that is a genuinely caring, compassionate man.

It's partly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity">Obfuscating Stupidity</a>, partly the fact that a time-travelling alien can hardly be expected to understand the social mores of every time and place he visits, and sometimes just the way he is:
<ul><li> The First Doctor is like this in a more subtle way  instead of coming across as demented, like later Doctors, he comes across generally as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewPolitenessImASenior" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewPolitenessImASenior">very rude</a> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrumpyOldMan">Grumpy Old Man</a>, but we slowly realize that he's making a real effort to be nice to people, and just isn't very good at it.

Generally, when he does react in a completely inappropriate way to a situation, it is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality">Blue-and-Orange Morality</a> or <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelliousSpirit">disgust with the idea of behaving appropriately in general</a>.
</li><li> Particularly strong with the Eleventh Doctor  his interpersonal skills are actually very, very good, especially by Doctor standards, but his understanding of human culture and what kind of behavior is inappropriate in the setting is minimal. For a classic example, see <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E11TheLodger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS31E11TheLodger">"The Lodger"</a>.
</li><li> The Twelfth Doctor is even worse than the Eleventh, by some magnitude. For starters, unlike the Eleventh Doctor, he tends to be unintentionally very rude to people and has extreme difficulty saying encouraging words or apologizing (Clara issues him with cue cards; they don't help). He doesn't understand how faces work and he has trouble recognizing people if they have changed their clothing or hairstyles, thinking that putting on an orange coat instead of a blue one would make him unrecognizably disguised. He treats humans with occasional naked contempt and sees no point in hiding the fact that he's an alien. He doesn't understand why, if someone asks you to get them coffee, you don't give it to them a week later. He is by far the least socially human incarnation yet  as if this was now the time to stop pretending he could ever be anything other than a Time Lord. It was intentional: the Eleventh Doctor spent nine hundred years on one planet prior to his regeneration, outliving the people he knew there again and again, being strongly reminded he wasn't human, and he let that show through in his next incarnation. However, by Series 10, at least seventy-odd years into this incarnation, he's apparently learned how to deal with faces and his social skills have developed to the point he now comes off as a stern but compassionate old man.

A few episodes have subverted this, though, by showing that he can actually be reasonably personable at times, it's just buried under layers of neuroses. For example, a large part of the plot of "Mr. Monk Is On The Air" is devoted to Monk's concerns about his deficient sense of humour. The episode ends with him watching his wedding video, and in it, he's laughing uproariously. It doesn't help that Monk's mother is shown to have been far more obsessive compulsive, and raised her sons to fear and obey her obsessions.

Thankfully he becomes more sophisticated so as time goes on. After all, he's being raised in a "normal" high school environment and is a quick learner due to both his age and his genes. He was grown by aliens: human but created to be a "Human Archetype" so that they could do tests on him. He has the absorbed intelligence of the thousands of people but not their social skills.

</li><li> On <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SiliconValley" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SiliconValley">Silicon Valley</a></em>, billionaire investor Peter Gregory is portrayed as this. He thinks on a completely different level from other people and doesn't seem to care about how they react to him. He loudly hacks if anything goes even the slightest bit out of whack. Additionally, most computer programmers are portrayed as being either overly abrasive or overly timid with little in between.

</li><li> In his youth, Worf was unskilled when visiting his family in the Klingon Empire, after being raised by humans. He's apparently gotten better as an adult, but is still considered rather uptight and overly serious. When he acts according to Federation values (like mercy, democracy, humility, etc) he tends to get odd looks and confused reactions though. He also learns about Klingon culture largely by reading about it, which shocks him when he starts to interact more with actual Klingons, who are far less noble, honorable, and stoic than he expects. During the Klingon civil war, he has trouble grasping the idea of sharing a drink with the other side's soldiers in the lull between the fighting.

<ul><li> Seeing as she's a psychic child prodigy raised from infancy as a secret government scientific experiment to develop a perfect human weapon, Eleven does not exactly have a strong grasp of social cues or appropriate social behaviour... as witnessed in the second episode when, after being offered a clean change of clothes by Mike, Lucas and Dustin, she prepares to strip off in front of them much to their mortification. She gradually gets a bit better, however. It should also be noted that several of the previously mentioned boys, being rather dorky social outcasts, also have their moments of poor or inappropriate social behaviour without the benefit of this excuse (particularly Dustin).

<ul><li> Castiel is an angel who hasn't spent a lot of time down on earth, so he tends to lack basic knowledge of human etiquette, as well as failing to grasp the concepts of sarcasm, rhetorical questions, and metaphor when he's first starting out. He also doesn't quite get the point of goodbyes or even of ending conversations in a conclusive manner. Once he's done saying what he wants to say, he goes <em>poof</em>, even if the other person isn't done yet. And he takes it the other direction, too — popping up next to people or behind them, or often in the passenger seat of Dean's car <em>while Dean is driving</em>, consistently ignoring the startled reactions to his sudden appearances.
</li><li> Jack is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YoungerThanTheyLook">a newborn that looks like a teenager</a>. Because of his looks, people assume he can be interacted with normally. But because of his actual age and life experience, he doesn't understand slang, subtlety or pop cultural references which results in very literal and awkward responses. He often mimics those around him as he tries to figure out the appropriate response, sometimes with comical effect.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SuperSentai">Super Sentai</a></em> has several characters lacking basic social skills. Most of them are either not human or haven't had much interaction with people during their childhood. Examples are:
<ul><li> Sion in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MiraiSentaiTimeranger">Mirai Sentai Timeranger</a></em>, an alien who was raised on Earth in a laboratory. He has a strange sense of what's socially appropriate, including, in one memorable incident, stating that he "loves" Domon—right in front of a crowd of girls that Domon was trying to pick up.
</li><li> Jan Kandou from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger">Juken Sentai Gekiranger</a></em>, raised by pandas and tigers. He calls himself a "tiger boy" and demonstrates incredible strength, such as having a tree fall on him with no effect. It takes him a few episodes to master the concept of things like doors. His defining trait, though, is that, while he can speak proper Japanese, he colors it with made-up babytalk words such as "nikiniki" (happy) and "zowazowa" (danger).
</li><li> The Gosei Angels in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TensouSentaiGoseiger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TensouSentaiGoseiger">Tensou Sentai Goseiger</a></em> suffer from this to some extent, though the Landicks are slightly less affected than the other three. They come from different sort of reality and didn't get to interact with people so much before being stranded on Earth. They get better through their stay.
</li><li> Hiromu Sakurada in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokumeiSentaiGobusters">Tokumei Sentai Go-Busters</a></em>, who is blunt, rude and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutallyHonest" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutallyHonest">Brutally Honest</a> often with no idea that he's said or done anything wrong; and has little idea of how to interact with others. Interestingly, he is the only team member who grew up outside of EMC, whereas Ryuji and Yoko (who have spent most of their lives there) are fairly normal. However, they do show occasional signs of this, such as in one episode where they don't seem to know how to dress outside of uniform and wear very outdated clothes to go to an amusement park.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UchuSentaiKyuranger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UchuSentaiKyuranger">Uchu Sentai Kyuranger</a></em> has two examples, both dramatic and hilarious:
<ul><li> Naga Ray, who comes from Spock expy race that supressed their emotions to achieve peace. Naga himself <em>wants</em> to have emotions and tries to learn how to express them and be as good with people as his partner, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverTongue" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverTongue">Balance</a>. He practiced smiling in the mirror and tried to match up the correct expressions and feels to the situation at hand. The effort payed off in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">end</a>.
</li><li> Stinger. Suicide mission? No problem. Apologize to his team? Impossible without stuttering and looking like anxiety eats him from inside out. He <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetChild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetChild">Used to Be a Sweet Child</a>, but being bullied by other tribesmen and watching his formerly kind brother slide towards becoming a power hungry <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight">Blood Knight</a> messed him up a bit even before the <em>really</em> bad stuff happened. Opening up to his team and spending time with them helped him become less awkward as time passed.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> Cameron from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></em>, since she is a terminator. Skynet's human disguise program: hot on the visuals, crap with the chat.
<ul><li> Interestingly, in the pilot, before she is revealed as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotGirl">Robot Girl</a>, she seems like a normal teenage girl, trying to make friends with John Connor. Then in the next episode Cameron is electrocuted and given a forced reboot, awakening as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmotionlessGirl">emotionless</a> and socially awkward, meaning <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameBackWrong">she possibly forgot how to behave convincingly</a>.
<ul><li> Cameron's shown the ability to fake human interaction long enough to get information out of people. It's only when she's being herself that she struggles.
</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheThickOfIt">The Thick of It</a></em> contains several examples. Olly, himself book-smart but not streetwise, asks hapless press officer <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDitz">John Duggan</a> "I'm not being horrible, but are you actually autistic?". Further along the autism spectrum is <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisiblePresident" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisiblePresident">unseen Prime Minister</a> Tom Davis, whose social skills are so lacking that the press officers doubt that they should let him out in public.
</li><li> Artie of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Warehouse13">Warehouse 13</a></em> has spent so much of his career in the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactCollectionAgency" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtifactCollectionAgency">Artifact Warehouse</a> that he is often considered uncouth by the new agents Pete and Myka. One episode reveals that he deliberately gives himself appendicitis every year in order to see a doctor he likes, until it nearly kills him and he finally has the guts to ask her out properly.
<ul><li> Claudia also has a lot of social awkwardness and has no idea how to behave with a boy she likes. Being locked up in a mental institution for years probably has something to do with it, as well as her being a genius.
</li></ul></li><li> An episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles">The X-Files</a></em> features the monster of the week as an entire feral family.

<ul><li> Stege from <em>Small Magic</em> lives almost exclusively in the woods and rarely interacts with other people, which contributes to him being a shitty teen. His clothes are tattered, he's very blunt to other people, he hates being bathed, and he tends to eat with his hands.
</li><li> Yoshi from <em>Here We Gooooo!</em> comes off this way since he was raised surrounded only by Yoshis. His grandpa the OG Yoshi told him many stories of the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameBreakingBug">secrets</a> in Peaches Castle, leading Yoshi to believe all castles were like that and begin randomly slamming his tongue into windows in Princess Caramel Seltzer's palace.

She's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociallyAwkwardHero">awkward</a>, stutters a lot, sometimes shouts her words when she's nervous, and tries to avoid people.

Lupus-born werewolves are thus technically wolves who can take human form, with all the foreseeable consequences when they try to blend into human society. Oddly enough, it's usually assumed that after their first transformation most of them can automatically speak whatever language was prevalent in the country were born in, just as Homid-born <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurWerewolvesAreDifferent">werewolves</a> instinctively know wolf language, but they can't necessarily speak it well. It's a lot of fun to tell a <em>Werewolf</em> NPC that the Lupus was raised by wolves when he shows a distinct indifference to conventional standards of politeness. Or hygiene. The degrees to which Lupus Garou assimilate human customs and language varies with the individual. Red Talons, a human-hating all-Lupus tribe, are generally the least knowledgeable about humans and prefer to stay that way. The other tribes all include both Lupus and Homid Garou.

When non-telepaths have to interact with them, munavri will routinely go off on lengthy tangents, overshare personal problems and private information, and completely miss their speaking partners' cues to end the discussion. In general, conversations with a munavri tend to be both rather uncomfortable and a lot longer than they need to be.
</li><li> In a bit of an inversion, at tables whose GMs insist that every (important) social interaction be roleplayed out without involving dice or other mechanics, it's potentially quite possible for one or more <em>characters</em> to formally have no social skills whatsoever without that making any difference in practice because they're just using those of the <em>players</em> instead.

Her Confidant revolves around her learning to be a part of society again, such as doing things on her own and reconnecting/saving an old friend.

Art is pretty much one of the only things on Yusuke's mind, to the point that he initially stays with the Phantom Thieves not necessarily to help others, but because <em>the other world they raid will provide new subjects for him to paint</em>. He has no tact in public, tends to be insensitive to others, and some of his antics when painting tends to scare off other people.

</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Bastard" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Bastard">Bastard!!</a></em>: Jin, not having much social interaction with his peers (due to finding him creepy) has little clue on how to act around other kids his age, and has only a child's understanding on certain topics such as sex, even flat-out asking Kyun what porn was without realizing how it could have been interpreted as a perverse gesture. This works to his Dongsoo's advantage of keeping him under control.

<ul><li> The entire cast of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheGuild" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheGuild">The Guild</a></em> have various social quirks either caused by their video game obsession or enhanced by it. In no particular order:
<ul><li> Codex: On medication for depression and cannot form relationships not related to the game. In the first episode her therapist fires HER for not being able to make any progress.
</li><li> Zaboo: Funny, loyal, and cares deeply about Codex — as only a stalker could. His personal knowledge of her definitely required some illegal hacking which he considers harmless homework.
</li><li> Vork: The oldest member of the group who cannot refer to anybody by their real names. His every word is in game-speak. Is also a hoarder.
</li><li> Clara: Seems fine in most circumstances, but only because she forgot she's a mother of three again. Where she left her husband and kids is a recurring distraction.
</li><li> Bladezz: All the charm of a slacker teenager. Does not know how to politely talk to women and doesn't seem interested in learning.
</li><li> Tinkerballa: Sarcastic, vindictive, and doesn't want to be talk to her teammates in the real world. She may be the most well-adjusted of the group.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAutobiographyOfJaneEyre" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheAutobiographyOfJaneEyre">The Autobiography of Jane Eyre</a></em>: Jane Eyre, the protagonist of this <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettingUpdate">Setting Update</a> web series. She's really shown to behave a bit strangely around people, and she openly acknowledges it to camera when she's shooting. She has troubles to come up with a good opening line.
<div class="indent"><strong>Jane</strong>: First I'm awkward to people, now I'm awkward to inanimate objects, too...
</div></li></ul></div>
<p></p><div class="folderlabel" onclick="togglefolder('folder17');">    Western Animation </div><div class="folder" id="folder17" isfolder="true" style="display:block;">
<ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AdventureTime">Adventure Time</a></em>:
<ul><li> The Earl of Lemongrab definitely fit this trope. Lemongrab has no social skills because he's mentally unadjusted from being the product of a failed science experiment.
</li><li> The Ice King is insane. His only friends are penguins, and even Finn and Jake, the main characters, find him to be an obnoxious jerk even though they have a grudging friendship.
</li></ul></li><li> Zuko and Azula from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></em> were raised in a royal court and have little experience with casual interaction. Zuko, mainly through <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">Character Development</a> and the positive influence of Uncle Iroh, is better off, but Azula is far worse, to the point that it's almost <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassWoobie">painful</a> to watch — she has NO ability to socially function outside of a battle or when not manipulating others. <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod">Aaron Ehasz</a> states that if there was a Book 4, Azula would've had a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn">HeelFace Turn</a> and received mental help, and she would've become the dorky variant of this trope (i.e. randomly spouting out how she feels).
<ul><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLegendOfKorra">The Legend of Korra</a></em>, Korra, Avatar <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender">Aang's</a> reincarnation, was whisked away to a compound deep in the south pole where she could master the four elements in complete safety and security. The only problem? After coming to Republic City with only her best friend Naga (a Polar-Bear Dog), she is almost completely tactless when it comes to dealing with the locals of the city and proves to be <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">Innocently Insensitive</a> when she winds up involved in a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveTriangle">Love Triangle</a>. A lot of people are able to influence her because of this.
</li><li> While Zuko is much <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderAndWiser">Older and Wiser</a>, he still has his moments, as shown in season three where he talks about the time he hired the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HavingABlast">Combustion Man</a> to kill the former Avatar... in front of the current Avatar's father.
<div class="indent"><strong>Zuko</strong>: ...It didn't work.
</div></li></ul></li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainSturdy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CaptainSturdy">Captain Sturdy: Back in Action</a></em>, the hyper-intelligent hero Cerebro curtly says "You're old" to Captain Sturdy. Cyber Master explains to Captain Sturdy that Cerebro is lacking in social skills because he <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradeSkipper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GradeSkipper">skipped a few grades</a> as a result of his advanced intellect.
</li><li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania2017" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Castlevania2017">Castlevania (2017)</a></em>, after his family's defamation and exile by the Church, Trevor Belmont had spent much of his life since his early teen years wandering alone, and, as a result, developed a somewhat surly personality that tends to rub people the wrong way. Even his attempt to comfort Sypha when she makes the decision to separate from the rest of her family goes badly:
<div class="indent"><strong>Sypha</strong>: Isn't it silly? They're heading into who knows what danger, and I'm standing here sad and angry because they're together and I'm alone. <br/><strong>Trevor</strong>: Hmm. <br/><strong>Sypha</strong>: ...<a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsThePartWhere" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisIsThePartWhere">This is where you're supposed to tell me that I'm not alone, Belmont.</a> You are really not very good at this. <br/><strong>Trevor</strong>: I learned to travel alone early in life. Maybe I just got too used to it. <br/><strong>Sypha</strong>: You had a family, though. <br/><strong>Trevor</strong>: Not much of one, and not for long. Okay, look, I know a little bit about what you're feeling. I'm sorry, but we have a thing to do now. All I can do is try and make sure it doesn't get you killed so you can see your family again. <br/><strong>Sypha</strong>: ...That's your encouraging talk? <br/><strong>Trevor</strong>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumour" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumour">Or, you get killed, and they get eaten in the forest, so none of you have to be sad.</a> How's that? <br/><strong>Sypha</strong>: I was right about you the first time, you know. You are rude. <br/><strong>Trevor</strong>: I've been called worse. <br/><strong>Sypha</strong>: Oh, I'm just getting started.
</div><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko">Code Lyoko</a></em>have Jeremie and Aelita, or 'Mr. and Mrs. Einstein' as some call them: both being very intelligent and not particularly socially skilled, if in different ways. Jeremie had no friends before the series began and struggled, particularly early on, with being anything but professional with them. Aelita meanwhile being <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> believed to be</span> an artificial intelligence who is quite unfamiliar with the real world. Aelita managed to grow out of this trope fully as the series went on, while Jeremie also improved if not to the same extent.
</li></ul></li><li> The trio that is <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></em>. All three are social outcasts who have difficulty mingling with the other kids.
<ul><li> Ed is a pretty nice guy, but he is also a large <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CloudCuckooLander">Cloud Cuckoo Lander</a> who's rather lacking in book smarts and his interests (horror-themed comics and monster movies) don't relate to the others. He can often annoy the others with this, especially his sister Sarah and Eddy.
</li><li> Edd is a sweet young man and the most endearing, but he is your classic nebbish and orderly intellectual. He can come as condescending at times, he's a neat freak and quite by the rules. So much so he can be lost in what the other kids like, even with Ed and Eddy.
</li><li> Eddy is a bit of a mix. Due to his primary role model being his <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherBully">his bullying scam artist of an older brother</a>, Eddy tries emulating him to earn the "respect" he believed his brother got. This along with Eddy's short temper and occasional abrasiveness makes him the hardest for the kids to get along with. On the other hand, he does have some measure of understanding how his peers work and outside his interests in scamming, is the most normal of the three (having a fair bit in common with Kevin even.)
</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls">Gravity Falls</a></em> gives us a bit of an odd example with <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlphaBitch">Pacifica Northwest</a>. Daughter of the wealthiest family in town, she seems to be your normal rich popular girl, but over time, it becomes clear that her background has left her with some social skills lacking. She has never had any real friends or enjoyed in doing acitvities such as sharing, which often means <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues">Hilarity Ensues</a> when she interacts with her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SitcomArchnemesis">Sitcom Archnemesis</a> turned friend Mabel. As such, while she seems capable in understanding how people work in general, she never really established bonds with people.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic">My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</a></em>:
<ul><li> Twilight Sparkle starts out like this due to her voluntary asocial lifestyle. Half the reason she's <em>in</em> Ponyville is so she can learn about friendship. She needed a <em>book</em> to tell her what a slumber party was and how to throw it! In the episode "Baby Cakes", she casually (and <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive">innocently</a>) tells Pinkie Pie that she pretty much expected Pinkie would be out of her depth caring for twin babies. She doesn't appear to notice that Pinkie is offended by this statement even as Pinkie kicks her out of Sugarcube Corner. She <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment">gets better</a> as the series goes along.
</li><li> And then you've got Princess Luna, though that can be excused for being <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FishOutOfTemporalWater">sealed in the moon for a thousand years.</a> She's bombastic, dramatic and a bit over the top, but she comes off as a big dork when she begins settling in. The comic books also add to this and we also see she was not as good with her subjects as Celestia was. Her lack of social skills, especially compared to Celestia's, when it came to interacting with their subjects and viewing them, may have been part of why Celestia was preferred to Luna.
</li></ul></li><li> One episode of <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceAcademy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceAcademy">Police Academy</a>: <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecycledTheSeries">the Animated Series</a></em> features a young man who was literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">Raised by Wolves</a>. Most of the episode is spent by the heroes teaching him human behavior or trying to find his parents.
</li><li> Mitchell from <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ReadyJetGo">Ready Jet Go!</a></em> is often shown to have a lack of social skills and can pretty timid and even robotic at times, especially in "Solar System Bake Off" where he acts awkward around the main cast while trying to gather information on their baking contest entry. Literally the first thing he says to them is "Hi, can I borrow a cup of sugar or salt, whichever is easier to borrow?" <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> In fact, this is shown to be the reason why Mitchell acts the way he does — he doesn't know how to fit in. Luckily, he gets better</span>.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife">Rocko's Modern Life</a></em> features Heffer the steer, who has constant trouble with social conventions. He was literally <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves">Raised by Wolves</a>, in this case a dysfunctional family of lupine suburbanites.
</li><li> Entrapta in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower">She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</a></em> has very poor social skills, preferring to spend most of her time alone, making robots. She tends to mention extremely disturbing facts regardless of other people's feelings, gets distracted whenever she's around tech, likes getting into people's space and taking things without asking, never seeming to notice her comrades' frustration. However, <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile">it turns out she's actually well aware of her poor people skills and is insecure over her inability to maintain relationships, having been abandoned multiple times by her friends. Nonetheless, she decides to put her skills to use to help them in ways she can</span>. Justified in that Entrapta has been confirmed to be autistic, and therefore has difficulty interacting.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse">Steven Universe</a></em>, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SixthRanger">Peridot</a> has incredibly poor social skills in regards to humans and the Crystal Gems due to being new to the planet. She's revealed to not understand why she feels bad (small) when she accidentally hurts someone's feelings. She also doesn't understand why Garnet chooses to stay fused or why the others don't treat Pearl as she was taught a member of her <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveRace">Slave Race</a> should be treated. Though it's shown that this is a result of her conditioning on Homeworld, as she quickly learns all of them spending time with the Crystal Gems.
</li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitans">Teen Titans</a></em> has Starfire. She is an alien from another planet and thus, Earth culture is quite new to her. Additionally, her people, Tamaranians, are quite open with their emotions and how they feel, so there's often a lack of subtlety in her actions. However, it makes her endearing, especially contrasting with her older sister, who while much more socially aware and seemingly cool, is a hedonistic jerk.
</li></ul><ul><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WeBareBears">We Bare Bears</a></em>:
<ul><li> Ice Bear almost never directly speaks to the other characters and is typically mute for most of the time. It's implied it may have been the result of his cubhood before meeting his brothers.
</li><li> Charlie is unable to fully understand social cues due to the fact that he has always had to fear and run away from people all his life.
</li></ul></li><li> <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YoungJustice">Young Justice</a></em>:
<ul><li> <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy">Superboy</a> is a clone of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman">Superman</a> who was grown in 16 weeks and fed information via telepathic genomorphs. Suffice to say he finds it difficult to deal with people, particularly his new teammates, when he's just beginning to adjust to life outside of CADMUS.
</li><li> Also, M'Gann who <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensStealCable">had learned about Earth by watching TV</a> and is ignorant of more common social behaviours and struggles to learn what is appropriate with regards to telepathy and privacy. This comes up with an in-universe case of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance">Values Dissonance</a> when <span class="spoiler" title="you can set spoilers visible by default on your profile"> M'Gann shapeshifted into Black Canary while kissing Conner. J'Onn says that it's common to shape-shift for a partner since everyone can read minds and wouldn't be confused. Black Canary was still very upset.</span>
